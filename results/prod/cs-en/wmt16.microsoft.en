In a distress call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line with a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb admitted to police that he had shot his girlfriend and that they needed to come to their home.
Lamb set out that his "sweet dog" was alive and probably upset at the house, and that contacts for the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found Amy Prentiss' body and a handwritten note on white office paper: "I'm so sorry and wish I could return it, I loved Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me," the letter, which authorities say lamb signed, said.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt through his office door.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb said he made a fatal call to an emergency line shortly after.
Finally came another death; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to take a look behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to figure out what Lamb's motivation was.
The details released by state investigators, as well as students and staff who knew him, together created an image of a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or history of violence.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote to thank the "great people" with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History together with 17 other faculty members, and many students took courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were tends to be trouble-sua tingling.
The student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for time off for health reasons, saying he had a problem.
And this year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's recruitment process meant that a doctorate lamb worked would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
William LaForge, the university's president, said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mr. Lamb seemed to be troubled by something."
Lamb won't answer those questions again.
After he left campus, police picked up his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state line back to Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gun shot in the backyard of his parents' home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington State Coroner Methel Johnson confirmed.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to the house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this county.
Lamb started working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city of about 12,000 people, in 2009 and taught geography and education lessons.
In the spring, he received his doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny person.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was this great older guy who tutored her guitar playing for years.
He was quite a heartbreaker back then.
The hearts of all the girls were scaring as soon as he showed up," says Hairston, who is now 40 and lives in the suburb of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for some time.
During an emergency phone call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the marriage record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the Gautier River arm.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19.
"She was completely collapsed," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he knew lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were out at a summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, sweating lamb playing guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"They were just a happy couple," he said.
We were joking and recording each other for a joke.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a slain professor, led a first-year seminary and specialized in native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married with three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys' student club and student government.
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, faculty members, employees, students and community members, attended a candlelight commemoration event.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also participated in the vigo, during which the college choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
School resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge says.
The crisis is over.
This is healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect the fact that police now claim lamb made an emergency call after he killed Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us says it won't take on as many seasonal workers as last year, but the maker of children's toys and products says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it will start recruiting applicants this month, and will recruit during October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help with stores and sales, for shipping and delivering goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his 'date' with Princess Diana
The "Back to the Future" premiere was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized princess Diana was going to be sitting there," he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time."
The film begins, and I realize I'm within reach of what might be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," is a documentary about "Back to the Future," which presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's truly, without a doubt, the best travel documentary ever made into a film."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and selected theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the countries - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of a General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers had "made this situation unsolvable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they showed in reaching an Iranian nuclear agreement to resolve the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers that show Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to describe him as a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved their hands like a misguided joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whatever republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, they're failing (so far).
10 of the last 11 national polls show Donald Trump in a double-digit lead, and some are seriously questioning what that means for the real estate mogul's nominating chances.
Of course, it is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership had paved the way for Herman Cain's rise, and in the end neither of them won a single position in the nominating process.
There are many reasons why he might come across in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth recognize Trump's will to hold on and are starting to unload their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a far-ed phase:
Trump's favorability rating has reversed 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was already 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers hold up in the early stages.
After a Quinnipiac University poll last week, it was found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "excited" or "satisfied" with Trump as the nominee.
Only two in 10 said they would be "outraged" at his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent said they would be "thrilled" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if gov. Jeb Bush became the nominee.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombast and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to think that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for the presidency, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Monday.
The same number is held in the Iowa State Senatorial Caucus, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think he has a leadership personality, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is the real candidate.
When asked who would most likely win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven't had the brightest crystal ball in the past.
By this time last cycle, 4 in 10 Republicans had chosen Rick Perry as the winner of the race, compared to 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see the Trump campaign as credible.
Even as Republicans rallie around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some pundits point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would lead the businessman by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one game.
A bare majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they have already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll tuesday shows that only more than half of voters who support Trump say they won't change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say that they've never changed their mind.
46 percent say they keep the back door open for a change among candidates.
Still, Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider his opinion final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign's announcing speech, immigration has still been a major and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump's bombast will draw key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage the rebranding.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll released Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain so.
Frustration with the government is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now receive roughly half of the support from Republican voters, especially given their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll released Monday say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry with Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Congressional Republicans, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "hellishly angry."
The House supported a larger share of the state's coal taxes.
The Czech Republic will receive more than 400 million.
At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of the proceeds of brown coal surface mining fees from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (ČSSD) promised MPs that this would give them extra money from both the State Treasury and municipal budgets.
The draft has been criticised by opposition MPs, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done so far, because they will pay higher fees directly into the state budget. At first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government's amendment to the Mining Act, which means, among other things, that the state should receive a larger part of the proceeds of brown coal surface mining fees from mining companies.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the way the remuneration for the minerals that companies extract is calculated.
The change in mineral mining fees is intended to bring CZK 427 million more to the state coffers than in 2013.
According to the government, it is intended to have a neutral impact on the revenues of municipal budgets, as the fee is to be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million from fees and CZK 150 million from the state budget.
From brown coal mining, municipalities were 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the remuneration from mining premises with permitted mining to CZK 1000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments is to continue to belong fully to the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this would give municipalities between CZK 14 million and CZK 100 million a year instead of CZK 14 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but determined by the government by decree.
The remuneration is newly calculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rates for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting the fee by government regulation may not comply with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax because the state is charging for minerals that are state property.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining receive fees.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three quarters of the money will go to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The ratio will be the same in the case of radioactive rock mining.
Some of the money collected by the state in mining fees will be assigned to the purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The draft was criticised by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would harm municipalities affected by mining and counties.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they would pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Dawn), elected in the Ústí Region.
Hana Aulická, a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, warned against an increase in unemployment in Mostecka.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed rejecting the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for processing.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining companies, the fee increase will not translate into coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term.
Thus, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, however, this increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in payments by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, in its view, the increase in employment fees is bearable.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that members know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before passing the act.
If coal is also exploited for limits, it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek in that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak Army mine should not be made until after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Veselý will lead the Czechs as number one, the deployment will affect the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board during Thursday's Davis Cup draw in India, and this time each of them is likely to be involved in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to spread the load over the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
Delhi has hot and high humidity, so tough matches are expected, which can stretch up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it out according to the weather.
And depending on how it looks, Navrátil said during today's training of czech selection in the center of Raj Kumar Khánna.
He counts on the team leader and world number 40 Jiří Veselý for friday and Sunday's singles.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek are likely to turn into two.
I'd like almost everyone involved.
"It's slowly in my head, but I'm not going to say it yet," said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech line-up should be Stepanek's participation in Saturday's doubles.
It's just a question of who's going to stand next to the experienced deblist, who has an 18-4 record in the Davis Cup doubles.
It's probably not going to be happy.
There are options left with Rosol or Adam Pavlásek.
"I really don't know who it's going to look like with or what it's going to look like," Navratilova said.
It will be decided by the development of singles.
Pavlásek may be a variant, he and Vesely surprised in the first round with a win in the debacle over the Australians.
"He's decent," Navratilova said.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to put in the same performance I've shown there since the second set.
"I am happy for the experience and I would like to bring a point," pavlásek said.
The home team will take on Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he beat third and fourth 100 players.
Number two will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
They're both challenger players, and ours has experience on the ATP Tour, but we've made sure a lot of times that the Davis Cup rankings don't make the decisions.
"It's the current form, the weather," Navratilova said.
Friday's opening singles match will start at 06:30 CEST (06:30 CEST) and may stretch due to the weather.
It's forecast to rain and the court isn't under the roof.
However, it can be played in artificial lighting.
It's already ignited, and it's got 2,000 lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights," Navratilova said.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been widely expected
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his Prime Minister's Questions debut later, and for the first time he will work with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six assigned questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully scrutined by the media and MPs.
In a weekly statement, he called for "less theater and more facts."
He also stated that he could skip several sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership following his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech to the TUC's annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand quietly during the singing of the national anthem on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has been met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and has been the focus of several front-page stories.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he would "stand in respectful silence" and would recognize "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he would recommend the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's top team, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences at work are also "accumulating" following Mr Corbyn's appointment despite his position in the European Union and the government's benefit cap.
Mr Corbyl told the TUC conference that labor was putting forward amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a benefit cap.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said the party had "very clearly" opposed the government's plans to reduce the cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader facing David Cameron in the decade since his election as Tory leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from the crowd" for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
The Islington North MP says PMQs are too confrontational and refrain from both "prompt responses" and gearing, and instead promises to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, will represent him at PMQs if he does not attend - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also dropped the idea of letting other colleagues speak for him from time to time, as he said he had discussed the matter with Speaker of the House John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics, which was often associated with PMQs, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs have been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their position among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and far-reaching reforms are needed.
"Photo shoot in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to go homeless.
But a group of ex-street kids found a way to learn something and make a living.
"I Was Photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches young homeless people how to take photos of their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of this project.

Pound rises as UK pay rises accelerate
The pound jumped on the following data and showed a recovery in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by the SABMiller supply target.
Between May and June, GB's profits, including bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
That was the fastest since 2009, and estimates of when rates would rise seemed to be approaching.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro at €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% at 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after getting a close offer from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the world's two largest breweries, and bring brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch closer.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it rose $2.5bn through shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest fallers on the index, falling 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the company to "sell."
JD Sports up 3.1% after sports firm reports 83% jump in mid-year profits before tax of £46.6m
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports executive chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labor costs in his firm, he says.
Plans to expand JD Sports could hit costs, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building are resenting marshmalth.
The controversial building got a stopwatch.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be unlawful and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested against the building, which is to be built in close proximity to the Anež monastery in the centre of Prague, in front of the Prague 1 office, and a petition was also launched.
In the decision, the Municipality stated that there had been a breach of the Building Act because not all the requirements of the zoning decision had been complied with.
"The zoning decision in question does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, the distance from adjacent buildings, the shape of the building described in a sufficiently clear and comprehensible manner, the delimitation of the area affected by the construction," its decision states.
The Municipality also considers it illegal that some of the grounds for the decision were issued for the documentation initially pending, but this has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It is clear from the file that, however, the landowner only provided his consent to the project documentation for territorial management, not the consent to the location of the building on his land, writes the Department of The Building Regulations.
According to Francesco August Razett of the investor firm, the Building Regulations Department did not take note of the decision of the superior authority - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review had already expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, complying with all laws of the Czech Republic and respecting all relevant authorities and institutions," Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call marshmalth because of the supposedly proposed façade color, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre in the past to protest the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses resent that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the inappropriateness of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate neighbourhood of the Anež monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the project from 2008, which envisaged a glass façade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Heritage Institute (NPÚ) and revoked the permit of Prague conservationists in 2010.
However, the new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with face-shaped windows was approved by the NPÚ and the municipal conservationists and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the complaints of opponents, saying that he never counted on a façade in pink color, which gave the project a nickname after pink-and-white confectionery.
A Czech politician gave a ride to the migrants.
The Hungarians put him and them in jail.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into the car, which they said they wanted to take for about half a kilometer.
At that time, he said, it was not criminal in Hungary, he told The People's Daily.
We knew law enforcement didn't see that kind of behavior.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, we were arrested and taken into custody in Szeged, he told the paper.
The politician ended up spending nine hours in his cell.
The police were said to have behaved correctly, but communication was entased because they did not speak English very well.
But prison, he said, was miserable.
For example, in our cell, measuring about three by four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were crammed in.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked up there for the second day, and because of the language barriers, none of them knew what would happen to them, Berg said.

Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash launches rural campaign to fight Aldi invasion
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and suppliers are teaming up with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's offering tastings at IGA stores, and shop owners are selling discounted Australian Football League tickets to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and hardware retailer celebrates its annual investor strategy day.
The stakes are high, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30 per cent of Metcash IGA business steps and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, with IGA stores enjoying a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, compared to around 14 per cent in eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will hit 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores to take over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million each.
The loss of food sales and fixed-price base volumes at Metcash could cost it around $13 million in pre-tax revenue, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although the latest Roy Morgan survey found that shoppers at the IGA were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks Metcash food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, said melbourne business lunches could "very likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Douglass' comments.
But it is known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the Metcash grocery store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers , have fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational developments in the speculative change as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler has gone on the offensive, investing more than $150 million a year to match counter prices at Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and news from private individuals.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says price-matching and store retrofidding programs will catch the momentum and hopes the big-sale will return to underlying profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been collateral damaged in the recent upsuake over his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour, tennis Australia president Steve Healy says.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," drew unwelcome attention due to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the umpire, harrison then declared: "Wawrinka should have stretched one out for Kyrgios and I should have stretched him too."
While he was last seen smashing a racquet after a spasm thwarted richard gasquet's possible defeat at the US Open, Kokkinakis stammered against Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a place in the second singles behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely that I think Thanasi was a little involved in the whole dispute," Healy says.
He destroyed his racket when he lost to a cramp in the U.S., but he's not the first player to take his own anger out of his racket because of frustration. I know Thanasi pretty well, and I can tell he won't be proud of this event.
But he really handled himself very well because he was subjected to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him too and I think he's been treated a bit harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard and fits into the team great and so on, he's never had a problem with other players, he's very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in amazing shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy and I just think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision to overlook Kyrgios for an important match starting on Friday, saying the "mutual decision" is the right solution for everyone, but supports the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term permanent player.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the match and not all the controversy that [Kyrgios] has created around him," Healy says.
And I think Nick has risen very fast, as Federer, Murray and others point out, he's growing rapidly in the public eye, he's made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the public eye when he can think about it. , is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for itself.
Europe's migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border, while hundreds of migrants piled up in no-man's-land and Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those stranded on the strips of land between the two states stand for an unknown time, those fleeing violence in their native countries set up tents and settle in.
But here comes feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants shout "Open the borders!" together, swearing at the Hungarian police's riot police.
Some refuse food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not just indirect harm.
Over the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries," says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc did not come up with a unified immigration policy at continuing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people seeking protection in surprise Italy and Greece, and spoke with the hope of reaching an eventual agreement next month or at the end of the year that EU nations would accept more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU European summit on Tuesday to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, did not pin its hopes on Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more power to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country now that the fence on the Serbian border is finished.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants who are going for a better life, not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalise violations of the 4-metre fence that the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and also set longer prison terms for those who transfer refugees illegally.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament still needs to approve the military deployment expected next week, but Associated Press reporters at the border have been observing heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic defense adviser, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border and had already captured 15 in the state.
They penetrated through damage to the fence and are now in police custody charged with misdemeanors under the new laws.
Authorities quickly had the fence fixed.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered in barbed wire.
Chaos arose at the main border crossing near Roszke as Hungarians opened a tiny office in a metal processing container and crowds formed.
About 20 of them fit inside, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary, refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is yet to announce whether he wants to run for president, is gaining support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main contests, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that there are clearly decisions to make about which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground to several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton maintains a big lead among women and moderates, but her lead is narrowing.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage with Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and they are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among liberals, but now Sanders is only five points behind her in that group.
About half of Democratic primary voters across the state say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, clinton's current supporters are particularly er in the way of her.
Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the fact that it's time for a woman (13 percent) to be president, and that she's the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, a great possibility of election and agreement on problems is cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to do so - a third think he shouldn't run.
When democratic primary voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party's nomination, Biden is the most common choice.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half listed Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead will expand from 20 points if Biden runs to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely to vote is increasing.
However, when it came to the issue of the candidate's greater importance, Democratic voters prefer problem solving to a better chance of being elected.
Like last month, neither Democratic candidate or potential candidate is positioning as an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates have a good track record in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy, and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads in honesty of all three, while Clinton is a strong lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have that view.
Democratic primary voters also generally see That Clinton, Sanders, and Biden are aligned with their ideological views.
By all these standards, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying it has not affected their overall view of her at all.
But it's a different story overall among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the subject was divided back in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
A majority of Americans say the email controversy has no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, while 36 percent say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
These are mainly Republicans, with more than 6 in 10 saying their views of Clinton have deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among her party's voters, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good signs of leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush performed best in honesty.
Sanders is seen by more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, many voters have not made up their minds about him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finishes behind Donald Trump in national election
Ben Carson moves closer to Donald Trump in latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates are responsible for half the electorate in the latest poll, and the others are looking for support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump overwhelmingly, climbing from 23% support in the latest CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News debate to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found Carson doing well across demographics, eliminating Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is behind Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker on the 10% support drop to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson improving, 19% support among Republicans behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
As Carson's trend has soared, Trump has decided to shoot a retired neurosurgeon blindly, and even Carson has apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign event in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of first-year Baruch College student
Nearly two years after a student died during an overloaded fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges were filed against five people.
Members of The Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and belatedly took him to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Police say he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand weighing 30 pounds and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his destination through a frozen field.
Mr Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of pi delta psi fraternity didn't call 911 immediately after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour to be taken to the hospital, police said.
However, they found time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president, and ask him for advice, Police Chief Chris Vagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their gear and essentially chose the well-being of the brotherhood over the life of Michael Deng," Chief Wagner said.
He was unable to be revived and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was struck again in the head, torso and thighs with a blunt object.
"Too many families have been devastated by fraternity overload, and at least one student has died each year from overloading since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, wrote in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step is important on the part of the institutions.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well," Wagner said at a tuesday press conference.
Baruch College banned fraternity, and the national fraternity broke off its relationship with local affiliates.
This is what will happened when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate rise will come, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take and how long it's going to take.
For the economy, in particular, the history of the small originator offers about timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising rates is often, though not always, determining how the economy and financial assets will react.
That is why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate increases will begin, but rather on trajectories of how long normalization will last.
There are actually more variables at play.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that any fuss about speed increases can be exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" Julian Jessop, senior global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect a gradual return of US interest rates to a more common but still low one, creating a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that adverse effects will occur.
Here's a look at how some areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen over the past month or so, the expected rate hikes can make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend for stocks to stop again 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect a lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed hike.
More precisely, the market has often been the most - about 14 percent - in the last 35 years or so heading for a rate hike in relatively flat 250 days (an average gain of 2.6 percent), and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. , posted on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle, and the return is beginning to diminish.
Recession is a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often help.
Currently, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not yet exist and that could hasten the recession.
Most notable is that gross domestic product near its lowest point in history when the Fed raises rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP increase was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expected it to hold when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, the Atlanta Fed reports.
Raising rates in this difficult economic backdrop could be risky, and the question could arise "whether these times are different," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been ready for the Fed's growth all year, and all eyes have turned to this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends On Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the increase cycles so far have been in a super cycle of leverage increases with GDP masking the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the onset of recovery," the report says.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has expected since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still going.
Fixed yield was also volatile, as the market expects a rate hike and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more evident on bonds than on stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increases, bond yields fall immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that a rate hike will bring yields closer between long- and short-dated bonds, balancing the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although "we are still cautious about stretching yields," Kathy Jones, a fixed-income firm analyst at Schwab, said in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects for tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are at the top, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased - all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US win after interest rates rise, and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with lots of debt will fare worse, because a rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market space, and their debt will also be greater.
"History shows that the "quality" of stocks tends to outdo itself within three months of the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a note to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outshot weak balance sheet companies by an average of 5 percentage points in each interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as low-volatility stocks, also outperformed their lower-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of variable interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to pure stock games, consumers are also benefiting from the rising dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, claims MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the station for 'hounding'
He is of the opinion that he is increasingly indistingu table from his commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they're simply cheating brits
Fellow MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice and says he's not an original idea either
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, a leading MP says, piling fresh pressure on broadcasters to prove they are doing something commercial broadcasters don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appears to be "being hoaded" and is becoming increasingly indistinguised from its business rival.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "fooled around " - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appear to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to my point where you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market," Mr Bingham said.
The BBC director general dismissed the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and public education.
I wouldn't learn what I learned about classical music on Radio 3 on any other radio.
And their commitment to living with music and making music is actually second to none.
"I also think Radio 3's commitment to new music and commissioning is also very important," he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it was now necessary to work harder to engage audiences than before because Britons are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production to come under fire for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during the broadcasts of Culture, Media and Sport and they got to the committee hearing.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a musical talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this programme is being discussed as unoriginal and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which Paloma's stars Faith andBoy George shine as judges - was produced "in a way typical of the BBC."
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "find a hit from its own stable" the next time it launches a fun series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending taxpayers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales are growing at their slowest pace since August, and Black Friday may be to blame
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%
Last month recorded its lowest growth since records began in 2000
Internet sales boosted three years ago thanks to mobile shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could be a reason to hold back spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, making many of Britain's high streets ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of steady online sales, and new data show a 7 percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the 2000 measurements, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of stabilizing online sales, and new data show a 7 percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, the situation has always been rationalized over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
It explains that internet sales were boosted three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, such as on the sofa.
But now (growth) is somewhat stagnant, and therefore seems to be fading away.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe customers could refrain from shopping before the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times more than the average shopper turned to their computers to arrange purchases, to drop several retailers' websites.
Experts believe Black Friday, which allows shoppers to re-contract, can keep customers from making more purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 out of every £5 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping in brick-and-mortar fashion stores.
Muslims buried victims of crane collapse in Mecca and Bin Laden family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly blaming the collapse of construction tycoon Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims have gathered to bury the 29 victims of a crane collapse at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. The victims' bodies were carried down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, mourners chose the path and paid their respects to the victims as the first of the fallen made their final journey to al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad message passed the holy site, where just a few days earlier a construction crane smashed through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family's construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 wounded.
Bodies of 29 dead after crane collapse at Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Haj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the haj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people continue to descend on the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in operation.
The Arabic version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi News Agency, states that binladin group is partly to blame for the crash.
The English service of the disk agency did not report this detail, but stated that the company's bosses had been banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are marching before the Haj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued a statement on the crane collapse and no representatives have been made available for comment.
The royal decrees also accused the group of not using the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and run major construction projects.
The late Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of a renegade who was renounced by his family in the 1990s.
The crash happened amid strong winds and rain just days before millions of people in the kingdom reached a pilgrimage that every able-as-been Muslim must complete at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be donated to relatives of those killed, and the same amount for the permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half that amount.
B&Q boss says Eastern European traders working for cheap are no longer trending
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laura
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the point of growth
The result is an open 200 Screwfix trades aimed at traders
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to be putting down hammers and brushes and handing them over to employed eastern European artisans to work at their home
If you're good with a hammer or a paint brush, you seem to be in the minority today.
As Britons increasingly employ artisans to do DIY work at their home, according to the head of the company behind Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new ceo of Kingfisher, which owns the home-made chain, says the large increase in the number of trained Eastern European retailers offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at traders, and closes 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laura says she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores because eight out of 10 shopping decisions in the store make better-offs.
Currently, most workers are male.
She said there is a need to address growing demographic trends that show more female households making more home adjustments than in the past.
Mrs Laura says: "We still have mostly men working in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women who make 80% of decisions about buying goods.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms Laura, who is one of only five women at the helm of leading firms under britain's FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect equality between male and female directors.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half the representation of women among employees, including executive and cfo.
Ms Laura says: "It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't difficult to find good women to take to our place.
Kingfisher reported a slump in both mid-year profit and sales after the group took on the cost of closing stores.
The kingfisher trend, which is owned by Screwfix and B&Q, is the result of opening 200 new stores
The December contribution of CZK 600 to pensioners is at risk.
"It is the justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice," said Miroslav Kalousek, vice-president of TOP 09, who stressed the principle of merit.
Zbyněk Stanjura, president of the ODS MEPs, noted that while the one-off allowance sounds good, in the long term it would be better to be in the standard indexation, as it would be reflected in the following years.
"We have room to find a mechanism to do this," Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marks (ČSSD), according to which it was to be indexed beyond the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
A higher indexation next year, she said, would mean a budgetary impact of CZK 5.5 billion, and ministers are debating every hundred million crowns.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (CSSD) reminded the right that in the past the pace of indexation had decreased.
The rapporteur Miroslav Opálka (KSČM) pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction in real pensions in 2016 and later.
The right's veto will make the payout much more complicated in December and possibly impossible, he said.
The President of the ČSSD, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed shortening the deadline for discussing the standard in committee to ten or 20 days, even this was blocked by the right.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost the state a total of CZK 1.73 billion.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions are expected to increase by an average of about 100 crowns.
According to the pension amendment, the allowance should be given to people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those whose pension entitlement ceased to exist in December before it was paid.
However, they would have to apply for the surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are indexed regularly as of January, with price increases and a third of real wage growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
According to the state's final account, the state spent CZK 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
Spending on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditures and 46 percent of all statutory expenses.
The average full old-age pension increased by CZK 104 to CZK 10,714 last year, according to data in the state final account.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, he will pursue science.
According to Russian media, the billionaire's Senate seat was almost certain.
He was to represent the Western Russian Kaliningrad Region, whose governor, Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the ruling United Russia party, defended his position in Sunday's elections.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by citizens, but are chosen by the governor from a trio of candidates whose names they will announce before the gubernatorial elections.
After the election, he will then select the senator from the trio of candidates.
The complication for Jakuun was the fact that he had not been in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years, as required by law.
While the Kremlin has found an exception for Jakunin, he is an extraordinary and empowered ambassador who is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
Filming of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger has ended.
The final straw in the protagonist's resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who has run out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurová decided on grandpa's life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar journey.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom again.
He longs to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the present, nightingale said to the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedy form a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
From the beginning, it was clear that the main role would go to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Nevertheless, he said he was surprised by the actor, who appeared on camera after a long break from convalescement after a serious illness.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised that he's probably a douche-up athlete.
He used to ask where he was going to sit before shooting the next scene.
This time he rode his bike, climbed rocks and even walked uphill.
All in record tropical temperatures, the director pointed out.
According to Bartoška, women marry a tiger to make a rabbit out of him over time.
They feed him a little, but they close the door so he doesn't think to play tiger outside the rabbithouse.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie about, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was played by Eliška Balzerová.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic, and she means well.
But at the same time, she's a usurp and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film parallels the fates of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alice - Tanya Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and son-in-law Erik and Pepík - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Radio and Televízia Slovakia.
Google has pledged millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google, an American internet company, has promised to provide up to $5.5 million ($132.6 million) to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing into Europe.
She announced it on Tuesday Google.org, a charitable offshoot of the internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled Telička's part of the visit for criticizing human rights violations.
Pavel Telička, a Czech MEMBER of the European Parliament for ano, postponed his upcoming trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities cancelled his official part of the visit today.
According to Telička, Baku justifies this with last week's EP resolution, which criticises human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Telička co-authored.
By decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telička lost the possibility of talks with official partners, as well as a visit to political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
The trip, which had been planned several months in advance, was to be used by Telička to meet with the parliamentary leadership and representatives of the executive, as well as with representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, specified the text sent to ČTK.
The EP resolution condemns 'unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan'.
It called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after the recent ruling against Azerbaijani opposition journalist K chadja Ismail, who advocated exposing corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building an air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky did not rule out the future of a Russian air base in Syria during a visit to Novosibirsk.
We don't have plans like that yet.
But nothing is out of the question, he said.
Russia has a long-time naval base in Syria at the port of Tartus, which it has so far used more as a service and logistics center.
However, according to russian press reports, russian supplies of Russian equipment and military equipment to Syria have increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from the trade agreements in force.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to establish an air base near the city of Takiya, which remains a stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for now.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, American commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, their third telephone conversation in 10 days.
Next week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Moscow to express concern about the collection of Russia's arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow's support for Assad a losing bet.
He said the objectives of Russia's policy in Syria were rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what, according to Earnest, is not entirely clear.
The war in Syria is expected to be the main theme of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York, according to russian press speculation today.
On the contrary, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in Donbass, Ukraine.
According to a report in The New York Times today, the US government has not ruled out president Barack Obama meeting with the Russian president during a UN meeting.
But opinions among White House advisers are said to be divided.
Tass reported today, citing kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the agenda of his New York residency.
Put on sesaem oil during a gallbladder diet, hemp helps strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsuicated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressing from cold seeds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, for example, gallbladder.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most common cause of death of Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly bothers women, sesaemic oil helps.
If you are a lover of Asian cuisine, you must not miss sesame oil in your pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of dishes and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of the formation of bile stones.
These are 90% the cause of gallbladder inflammation, and women suffer from these difficulties 3 times more often than men.
In general, problems with the gallbladder mainly concern overweight people who do not sport and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesaem oil can be successfully used in a liver diet that is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits that consuming this oil brings, they should beware of goods from exotic food stores.
Asian manufacturers often use over-roasted seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
However, the oil will lose all active substances, said Ladislav Hačecký, Executive Director of Bohemia Olej z Kraslice in Sokolovsky, a Czech company that produces cold-pressed organic virgin oils.
The company now also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively uncooked seeds of white sesame.
In an hour, our press can squeeze 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees and therefore the product meets the criteria for extra virgin marking.
At higher temperatures, nutritional substances would be lost.
Sunflower oil benefits from diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
Research by Jarmila Hamerská, which she led at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents prefer him in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it begins to burn at 180 °C.
It is better to use it, for example, for the aftercies of salads and is especially useful in a diet in which it helps in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsuiced fatty acids, which of all fatty acids reduce cholesterol levels the most.
In case of heart problems, you need to be careful about the amount of total fat and calories taken.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
As regards the energy value of food, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower one lasts as long as sesaem and hemp lasts nine months.
Storage in the refrigerator will extend the shelf life even further.
Old oil is recognized especially by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no cloudied at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Hemp seeds are among the so-called super-food, and therefore hemp oil is considered the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This designation owes the highest content to omega 3 and omega 6 unsuiced fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself, and one must receive them from food.
Especially important is the intake of omega 3 fatty acids.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders accept 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and in the healing of injuries.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about the use of cannabis oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best sellers at Bohemia Olej.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one tablespoon on an empty butt in the morning.
Hemp oil is not distinctive in taste, but it will greatly strengthen immunity, advised Daniel Vlček from the beauty company Bohemia Olej.
According to statistics, americans are the most passionate nation of barbecuers.
There are 1.4 grills per household.
Various barbecue competitions are held all over the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not behind either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have nevergrilated in their lives.
The vast majority grill several times a year.
In order for the grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - the ideal is to adjust the meat by marinating it a few hours before heat treatment.
Which oil is most suitable for this and at the same time leaves health-beneficial substances during grilling?
In general, fat should be saved during the grilling process itself.
Experts agree that a large part of oils begin to lose their taste at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose beneficial substances from them, which we otherwise get from them when consuming oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their application during grilling.
Grape oil for grilling, health and beauty.
When you say meat, experts from Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in Sokolovsky immediately equip grape oil.
It complements the taste of meats and fish wonderfully.
In the kitchen is characterized by a unique feature of increasing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such a high temperature, daniel Vlček from Bohemia Olej, one of the few Czech producers of this vine oil, describes the benefits of grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more potent than vitamin E and 20 times more potent than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsuicated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Due to its favorable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help to increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps in the care of dry and brittle hair.
Chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example, when seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
There are two ways to use barbecues, marinating and grilling.
By marinating meat and fish, we preserve their juiciness.
When preparing the marinade, three ingredients must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
For example, we supply acidity with apple cider vinegar to soften the meat.
Spices add flavor to the meat and preserve the oil and give the right cut, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, it adds that grape oil is ideal for marinating because it is one of the few oils that can pass through dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that it only takes a few drops to prepare meals.
The same goes for barbecues.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be warmed at all.
Before grilling, rub the grate with oil to prevent food from burning.
The preparation of attachments is also an essential part of grilling.
Practically anything goes with grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and many more.
Chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, hot summer salad.
For this you need: • 1 peach • 1 bunch of arubergles • 1 cup chopped cucumber • 1 cup salad leaf mixture • 3 tablespoons grape oil
Add the pickled arugula, chopped cucumbers and chopped peach to the salad bowl to the salad leaf mixture.
Salt and pepper to taste, you can also season with ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drip a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it is not only the patients who matter, but also the will of the patient to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease, and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, occupational ergotherapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not only about medical care, for example, women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations if they decide to have a child, social counselling, recommendations in housing arrangements, etc. are included in the care of these patients.
Yet all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be significantly influenced by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and may not fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sick frees up space for disease activity.
For example, regular movement has been shown to significantly delay the time when the patient needs some compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to various myths, such as that illness automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
That's why the Give Yourself a Chance (www.bezmytu.cz) page was created, which is supported by the ongoing Give Yourself a Chance media campaign.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, the adage twice that the sooner the disease begins to be treated, the more likely it is for the doctor to influence something.
This is because we have multiple sclerosis drugs at an inflammatory stage where the neurodegeneration process is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the chance that we will be able to stop the disease and put off disability, explains Eva Medová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important in people with multiple sclerosis, which most often addresses weakening of the lower limbs or balance disorders.
Patients are worked on according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It is really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient," says Martina Kövári, Head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at motol University Hospital.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way for everyone.
Rehabilitation can not stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
However, physical activity also strengthens the immune state of the organism, which is desirable in case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive of regular exercise is that the sick check what they can do, and this strengthens their confidence.
"Endorphins are also washed out during exercise and make you feel good," says PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
This is how we directly interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
"Previously, these patients were so-called savers, today we know that they need a targeted load," says Prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, Head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine at motol University Hospital.
The aim of physiotherapy is to ensure that a person can remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including job placement.
Physiotherapists therefore work with occupational ergotherapists to give each person a compensatory aid tailored to him.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it shakes most people.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
They must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we're supposed to go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them so that they eventually come to the conclusion that even with a handicap one can live a full life and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life," says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Neurological Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, airbuses would not fly.
Aerospace production is synonymous with precision and advanced technologies.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and solid composite materials that someone cannot make and process any time soon.
Yet, alongside super-accurate, computer-controlled machine tools, next to autoclave for forming composites, you can come across something as ordinary as apricot stones.
In the drum, which resembles a cotton candy pot, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are recithed in a pile of ovens.
"So far, no one has come up with anything better," smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of aviation door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the area in Prague Letnany, the former Letov produces a complete door for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The door, part of which is assembled in Prague, also enters passengers of the first and upper classes on the upper decks of the world's largest airliner Airbus A380.
There's also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the company has the torque keys set up twice a year.
In the case of a yellow sticker, they would have something to explain to the auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who regularly go to check whether the doors are made according to the agreed rules.
But advanced technology has not yet completely replaced human senses.
There are 1500 sourdots on one door to the A320.
The nýtars must shake them manually.
It takes them two days.
Even by the sound of the hammer falling, they can tell if the claw is already properly shaken.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The hem can fly from zero to 0.13 millimeters above the surface of the aircraft.
That's roughly twice the thickness of a human hair.
When inspecting, it's the turn of a trained touch.
When the controller swipes over a row of rites, he can tell if any of them are out of tolerance.
Then he picks up the exact pervert.
Before 1989, Letov was a member of the L-39 training military aircraft program.
But by 1991, not one had been made.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
That's when she teamed up with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won a tender for an emergency door supplier for the A321.
Courting Boeing wasn't so happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee Boeing long-term stable deliveries," dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would have been slammed if Letov had not taken the French latecoere group at the Prague Conference of the International Aviation Industry Association in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, dubsky says.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new orders came with a strong company.
In 2000, the installation of door parts for the A320 began.
Three years later, the upper deck doors for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries for the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we wouldn't have gotten to these big jobs ourselves.
Maybe we'd be making parts or small parts.
Partners want guarantees of supply for twenty or thirty years, dubský explains.
Last year, Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over CZK 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of CZK 147 million.
Exclusive status among aircraft manufacturers is not free.
Latecoere has invested CZK 1.5 billion in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and qualification cards for key employees.
Without them, the company would not have produced any aircraft doors.
It costs millions of crowns to obtain certificates that production processes meet customer requirements and to keep them in repeated inspections.
Production processes change every year.
They're more accurate and stricter.
We need to train employees, retrofit equipment and re-certify the process, Dubský adds.
Now the company is completing the preparation of the process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing harmful cadmium for human health.
They received the assignment from the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
The boeing people are coming, they're going to check the concept of the whole line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They're going to check our lab, as well.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, explains Dubský's way of controlling them.
The reward is long-term exclusive contracts for the Prague company.
With the Prague plant, the production of embraers stands and falls today.
For the A320, it produces half of the total door volume.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very complex for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
But that doesn't mean he can put any price behind the door.
The contract includes a price curve.
It indicates how much one door will cost after ten, fifty, hundred pieces made.
The price per piece keeps falling to a certain limit value.
We need to fit into this pricing pattern.
If not, we'll be going through a long time, says Dubsky.
Half of the hall, where electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are being assched, is empty so far.
But it is a symbol of the future.
A new semi-automatic line for the recissing and fitting of doors for the upgraded A320 Neo is being built behind the screen.
The entanting is accelerated and refined.
"This is a trend that aviation assembly is taking," dubský adds.
Sales are secured by the future line.
Airbus reports that airlines have ordered 3,278 new A320s so far.
Just a few meters away, a line will be created for the complete installation of doors for the upper deck of the A380.
It's a strategic decision by our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin within two years, says Dubsky.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualification tests, for example, for the installation of some electrical and electronic devices in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company is also betting on further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit for the company to be able to process composites in addition to metal materials," dubský says proudly.
Latecoere, however, is on the edge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place in the Letov area where it is located.
Before the French mother's entry, the company had 180 employees.
Now it has 800, and within three years there could be 100 more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are oversteering how many hundreds of new planes the airline orders each year, they don't have to worry about their jobs.
Although it has orders for several years in advance, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money to make september loan repayments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to reach an agreement with the main creditors.
At the end of August, she traded some of the loans to them for shares.
Creditors acquired a 37.4 percent stake in the company by raising €57.4 million.
The company's debt fell by two-thirds, or €180 million.
The second part of the financial recovery came at the beginning of September.
The company has signed new shares among existing shareholders for €222.9 million.
In total, it increased its share capital by EUR 280 million.
At the same time, the group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
It expects average order growth of four percent per year until 2017.
In the custom book, it has orders for €2.6 billion, equivalent to four years of production.
French media say Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on an I.D.
The Czech plant in Prague's Letnany is important for groups.
It contributes 16 percent of the group's sales.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
MPs supported a larger share of the state's coal charges.
The change in mineral mining fees is intended to bring CZK 427 million more to the state coffers than in 2013.
According to the government, it is intended to have a neutral impact on the revenues of municipal budgets, as the fee is to be higher.
In the year before last, municipalities received approximately CZK 450 million from fees and CZK 150 million from the state budget.
From brown coal mining, municipalities were 200 million crowns and the state 66 million crowns.
The amendment also provides for an increase in the remuneration from mining premises with permitted mining to czk 1,000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments is to continue to belong fully to the municipalities.
Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told MPs that this would give municipalities between CZK 14 million and CZK 100 million a year instead of CZK 14 million.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but determined by the government by decree.
The remuneration is newly calculated as the product of the amount of mineral extracted and the rates for each type of mineral.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting the fee by government regulation may not comply with the Constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax because the state is charging for minerals that are state property.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining receive fees.
In the case of deep-sea coal mining, three quarters of the money will go to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The ratio will be the same in the case of radioactive rock mining.
Some of the money collected by the state in mining fees will be assigned to the purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide mining rescue services.
The draft was criticised today by opposition MPs, who argued in particular that it would harm municipalities affected by mining and counties.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they would pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to improve the budget," said David Kádner (Dawn), elected in the Ústí Region.
Hana Aulická, a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, warned against an increase in unemployment in Mostecka.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed rejecting the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for processing.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining companies, the fee increase will not translate into coal prices, as prices are more than 90 percent long-term.
Thus, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the price increase.
"On the other hand, however, this increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in payments by seeking to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees," the government admits.
However, in its view, the increase in employment fees is bearable.
According to the rapporteur on the amendment Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that members know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal mining limits before passing the act.
If coal is also exploited for limits, it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mládek in that the decision to break the limit on the Czechoslovak Army mine should not be made until after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve prepares to meet in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A Reuters survey of 80 economists found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now think they will remain dormant for some time, leaving interest rates in the 0-0.25 percent range.
It's a historic event, because it's been a long time since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank might be able to get out of the zero bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates," says Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has done relatively well, recovering by adding trillions of dollars to the government account and creating only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore a less rosy global outlook.
They warned markets to be prepared for an increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see great chances against the move.
The decision is due to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET (CET).
Delta State University shooter left a note
Shannon Lamb, who shot and killed his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and his colleague later that day - wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and wished he could take it back, authorities revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a geography and social sciences teacher at Delta State University, called police around 10 a.m. on Monday morning.
and said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send officers to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house who "won't bother anyone" but is upset.
The police asked for the name of the caller, but Lamb didn't introduce himself.
Lamb also did not explain why the house was shot.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb that said, "I'm so sorry and wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who's ever loved me."
After leaving a message, Lamb made the 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
William LaForge, the university's dean, said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was obviously something going on in Mr. Lamb's head."
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was "no evidence" of a "love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a "great person."
The divorce happened 15 years ago, but they both remained friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was "shaken" by the case.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Linsday Knowles, a close friend of Prentiss', as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to relatives Monday and said he "won't go to jail."
When officers caught up with him on the freeway near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled over and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to a biography he posted on the school's website, Lamb received his doctorate in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars who have lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had some stressful years.
He battled leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer in 2009.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
I'm sure all these things take their toll.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg during Manchester United's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
While the left-back has been left in tears by the injury and has been sidelined for a minimum of six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moreno's reckless tackle in the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw made his way into PSV's area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and an oxygen mask was also needed before he was taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a guy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has it very hard, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he was also wearing an oxygen mask.
wept.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and he won't be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he'll play again this season.
Moreno was very lucky not to get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gall implied that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very nasty procedure with both feet.
A tweet from Shaw's account says, "Thank you all for their messages, words can't express how devastated I am, my road to recovery begins now and I'll come back even stronger."

The England defender will have added motivation to recover from next July's European Championships in France.
Phillip Cocu, psv coach, said: "It was a very nasty injury."
When any player leaves the field with an injury like that, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the goal of our players to hurt their opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in the 2014 World Cup match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland.
"It's very hard for him because his intention wasn't to hurt his opponent, and when you hear about the severity of an injury like that, it's not good," Cocu said.
I haven't been able to see this moment.
I only saw the ball going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see the tackle on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how he feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling's surgery.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
This is something every parent knows: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn't take long for them to learn it almost by heart.
But you mustn't be David Cameron.
When asked by a children's scheme provider to name a popular children's book, Prime Minister Lorax chose a 1971 fable by Dr Seuss.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a message posted on supercamps' website, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with strong content, I liked to read that to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I hadn't seen before."
Well, only then, in the following paragraph, Cameron reportedly described the plot of the book from an elevator from the 2012 film, which added more characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
"In the city of Thneed-Ville, surrounded by a wall where all nature ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," is the brief content of a book that chronicles the object of love unknown Dr Seuss, whose real name was Theodore Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that weren't suspicious enough, the text supplied by Cameron reads like a summary extract of Lorax, which is on the Internet Movie Database page, and begins with the words: "In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey."
Being an outspokenly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron will get acquainted with the plot of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the greedy, tree-cut industrialist Once-ler, who, despite the protests of the titular Lorax, a crouched, mustached creature who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, such a relatively small-time PR task was given to an assistant who had never read Lorax to a child 20 times straight.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to have come from the Office of Cameron supporters.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by a Cameron employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in jeopardy of England's omission, but he's still holding
Competing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team England have selected for this tour, I think a repeat of the 3-0 defeat they suffered last time in the Test series will be unlikely.
I wouldn't rule out winning guests, too.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting line-up and the collective thinking is also strong; they will not carry the scars of 2012, only youthful positivity.
With the ball Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at Test series level, represents an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of England's test series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough nut to crack for me to analyse because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been against two good attacks in challenging conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged on performance.
For example, there were no question marks around Joe Root's name, which led to an announcement because - and I have mentioned this before - players are their best selectors.
A few more half-century, and Lyth could extend his streak, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though his performances were not entirely 100%, and that does not surprise me; He's always been a team player.
The question of how much Test time a batsman gets to show up is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps - just like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton scored nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you could grumble about is that England gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean first - even though Lyth was at his best - but this missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
Here comes Alex Hales and that's a batsman I rate very positively.
He's the x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he kind of did.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course all this will depend on the overall line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while maintaining four quicks, has been raised and I have no objection to it.
I don't understand why the strokemaker can't bat and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them and there's not much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 Tests before his performance in 2001.
He immediately managed three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a back-up spinner and when I had the opportunity to watch him, he impressed me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his raw stats - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and I see that as a farce, but there aren't many spinners to raise their hands and selectors opt for youth.
He's going to learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seem to have made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a Test match consultant may be a masterstrow.
He is one of the most beautiful guys who will bring a wealth of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in at the white-ball tour and brings both energy and ruthless sparkle to the team.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be exploited.
New voices in the dressing room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes has been given a one-day leave, just as Root was given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that decision.
While many disagree, coaches and selectors do not create a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron's half-baked strategy of renegotiating britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with each passing day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn will lead the Labour Party, or the TUC will take the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is mired in various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States have had enough of Britain's egocentric agenda, dividing concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided they didn't want it even if they eroded social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home saying they are winning allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unassued Britain in Europe - "Don't leave us alone with France," berlin says - suggests that some shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don't care about us leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as has been the case for too long the continuing Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is fading, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch them break their legs to help selfie Brits who could invest their energy better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don't want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks during the 2017 REFERENDUM campaign in the UK to hasten the Brexit process, a friend claims.
"Renegotiation has solved the problem" and "Britain has nothing of value in negotiations."
To their detriment, Europeans know how ferocity Fleet Street can be and how sceptical the press oligarchs are about the EU because they were not 2-1 in the 1975 Tony Benn-inspired referendum that backed our 1973 entry.
They may vaguely remember the name boris johnson, the sly Euro-opportunist who made his name as brussels correspondent "EU straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-paying scoundrels, phone-hacking foreigners, and pseudo-overseas departments that owned most of the big newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a rabies gorilla, you have to throw bananas at her so she doesn't have you for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine, ever since Blair conceded the principle of abolishing the EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and won him a sacking card.
The press never forgave him, too.
But the lovely Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he must not waste any more time on me - seems in danger of re-edacting Neil Kinnock's murdoch boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose seat at the BBC he left on Sunday.
Corbin's official stance on Europe is evolving, I'll put it kindly.
He says he would like to stay in a reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the frenzied tendencies of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory little Englanderism can certainly accept that.
That's what Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said on radio and television this week, when his inner boy scout couldn't decide to admit that Corbyn's appointment of abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was the wrong decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father fought on TELEVISION for his loyalty without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's fight was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "at all times" - Benna's phrase - apparently wasn't what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, he touched me too - the discipline of the news remains important in the age of all-day television broadcasting, and especially in the vortex, the party of paranoia and betrayal that is social media.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic squirming about EU membership - in line with their Bennite-besieged economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of small differences is central to dogmatic bickering.
As with his squirming about Nato - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign will not want to end this - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - for Britain's concessions when it seems pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed with Bria's "weak military performance in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even in reducing the costs of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded at monday's launch of something called the Security Forum of British Influence.
Experts criticise public health England's review of electronics
The government-funded statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have ties to the tobacco industry, researchers report.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used in their e-cigarette report by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published a "landmark" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence."
However, several researchers questioned the vastness of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet last month attacked the "extremely flimsy base" on which PHE based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ disputed the claims, which were allegedly "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They state that the public might expect phe's claim, which is "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to prepare an analysis of the multi-criterion (MCDA) model's decision to synthesize their views on the harm associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell say one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly had previously raised funds from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved BAT's public health mandate in the sustainability report, he says.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting admitted funding from the e-cigarette maker, but not the funding it allegedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
There is no reason to select panel members, but they do include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also claim industrial funding in newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The tobacco management also attended the meeting at PHE.
The report produced by this group "eloquently acknowledges" the lack of "hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products to most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these links or limitations are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claim that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claim at the BMJ had been answered before.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifelong smokers dies because of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what they do not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related illnesses and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly highlighting the current evidence - that even if e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they carry only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should quit EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
The former Channel 4 director, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give their right hand" for hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programmes that are not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, into difficult airtime compared to its rivals" biggest ratings show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After General Director Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried without success to connect with the BBC for the six years he worked at Channel 4.
"I am fighting the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions," Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee as part of negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you keep royalties that I am not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, production should be reduced at least in terms of programmes that others do not produce or commission.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and, of course, meaningless.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programmes that can be funded without contribution.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would give their right hand for them.
I can't understand how these are a public broadcaster.
I don't think it's going to weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC he felt guilty about catching up on ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support."
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows echoes those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the BBC's more pampered public service programmes "go to BBC4, where quite often audiences cannot be measured, but they do their authority and can argue when they are preparing for their hypocritical mission of justifying £4bn of royalty income, "But of course we do all these obscure programmes that no one is looking at."
They're broadcast at a time when no one's looking at them.
As for the royalty, Johnson told the committee, "I challenge you to find a more regressive system regarding who gets the best value out of it.
Of course, we all think that £150 a year is a large sum, but for people for who find £150 a lot, I'd be surprised if they pay that much because they don't look at the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He confirmed that the bbc's small production volume had now been classified as educational - it used to be 1% of TV production and 0.1% on radio - and should take public broadcasting in Australia and Canada as a model and change to "inform, clarify and entertain."
On the subject of partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, where only a handful have been broadcast on television, and connect with commercial reporters so we can see them all online.
"Sonogenetics", or control of brain cells using sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses affect the direction in which nematoes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny nematode changes direction when they are struck by sound pulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
Pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and write brain activity using light
Scientists said these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and activates outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes that stimulate the brain are injected into the patient's brain. The method is used, for example, to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematode usually does not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction occurs when it is placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he discovered, bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then pass through the body of worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves act in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are located in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells they are connected to, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
To control nematoeisms using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to such modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubs and transferred to worms, where modified motor neurons turned on.
The new method is similar in many ways to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off using light.
But Chalasani said sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, ultrasonic waves can penetrate the tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases," Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also be used in the treatment of muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture device - right on your doorstep!
Ads seduiting the British arms trade.
Watch Amnesty International's anti-throw market video.
Menacing killer drones!
Leg shackles that break ankles!
Spleduvs!
And electric stun batons that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and caricature of metaphors leave no one in any doubt that this advert at the world's largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through international veselice's defence and security facilities at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands district.

But a separate campaign is also being run with posters being put up at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Travel to DLR from 15 to 18 September?" reads one, using a font with London Underground signs with DLR lines to become an image of a tank.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DLR... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists exhibiting their work at banksy dismaland's Museum of Cruel Design.
A collective called special patrol group helped distribute them all over London and using "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen key, which supposedly "gains access to about a third of the advertising space of bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism."
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists switch to working with activists within protest movements and realize that they need to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade greets subway passengers.
Amnesty's video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the VCCP agency working without pay, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the quiet surrounding the arms trade ads - he saw an empty space on the ExCeL calendar - and think, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They toyed with creating more realistic risky corporate advertising, but "by adding colorful colors and animation, we've made it more attractive."
"They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair," says Tom Davies at Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture facilities are not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army for "on the arm of the LAUNCH AT4CS RS."
This includes "a uniquely shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target."
Whatever it is, it's not going to be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student dorm
11 years ago, I moved into student dorms as an oblivious 19-year-old boy, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the tense smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to the dorms can range from mildly nerve-wracking to totally appalling.
It's tempting to babble: telling people where you're from, if you took a year off, how you feel about Corbyn, and why "you honestly don't love Marmite, because people, it's just a HAHAHA yeast extract, I'll be in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to take a breath too - ask questions and show interest.
It's driving the conversation, and it's going to help you find the people you love, and the ones you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they were putting out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often changed into drinking receptions, movie night spots and communal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts in college come up short.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of dorms are turning into an out-of-room walking culture that's friendly, sociable and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who needs to be charged.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you."
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write to them instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
There was a kid in my dorm who used to say that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you started going to college at the height of baking mania, knocking on other people's doors and a show with a plate of baked cookies seems slightly less weird, less than "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile while I ask personal questions."
Offering home-made enjoyment is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you, and maybe everything will end up assigning your face to a tasty surprise.
This is, of course, the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and hardness are likely to interrupt others pretending to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
Stealing a whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea stealing?
Double-check with the milk owner.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're raging inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it a little more maturely than my roommate, who swapped her milk for a dishwashing detergent to punish the thief.
He's in jail now.
You should not make sounds that distract people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent human being, you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they could quiet the drum and bass a little bit as it was 3am and she had a piste in the morning.
Their answer was to amplify the music.
When they finally fell silent at 5:00 a.m., she let them sleep peacefully for two hours, and then she played her own music aloud, locked the door, and went to her three-hour class.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same dorms as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be appallingly embarrassing if you mistook your roommates for your future wife, slept together, broke up and had to see each other every day, and maybe she would take control of your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you won't command the heart - but if your sexy roommate is definitely not your future wife, try to talk to your weaknesses at least a little bit.
At an uplifting moment when you realize someone left their keys in their unlocked room, there's only a fine line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their security by sourdeming something for them - never ruin someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and put the keys in a bottle of water, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on their ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a hard time during her pregnancy with today's seven-year-old Vítek.
His father broke up with her, and she was alone in preparing and raising the offspring.
I dealt with the situation quite quickly - I was very much looking forward to having a baby and looking for positives in it.
I tried not to worry about the uncertainty and being alone with the baby.
And I certainly had hope that we wouldn't be alone for long,' Eva recalls her first pregnancy today.
Even then, she met Elder Vašek on the Internet, with whom they began to talk about their favorite movies.
Vasek even brought Eva and Vítek home from the maternity hospital, but he did not play the role of stepfather much.
"He withdrew from the program for a while," Eva said in the documentary Four in Three.
The motive of the third season of the Czech TELEVISION series is precisely the search for happiness on the second attempt.
Thanks to her part-time work and great help from her mother and her aunt, she managed the care of Vítka and the financial security of her family.
Even the prospect of responsibility for a foreign child did not spoil Vaško's affection for Eve.
They finally got together around Vítek's second birthday and now he understands Vašek as his father and also addresses him that way.
Although Vasek already has two adult daughters, he says he enjoys fatherhood at 60 and is also more devoted to children.
In addition to Vítek, they were joined by two-year-old Leontýnka and finally twins.
"Vasek came into our family naturally, perhaps because my mother never really talked to me about relationships," says a smiling Eva.
Not enough space?
At least we're close.
Twins Ema and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with pregnancy cholectase at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of the pregnant woman and are manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, in the mother after childbirth it usually spontaneously fades away.
Ema and Ela were born healthy to Eva and Vachka's happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
Emička was placed in an incubator in the intermedical department, where Vaška's niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was larger and immediately after transport from the ICU to my room I had her with me, describes the difficult period after the birth eva.
She spent 20 days in the maternity ward until doctors agreed to release the babies, who had managed to reach the 2-kilo limit in the meantime.
Waiting to have babies in the maternity ward didn't make Eva happy.
"I was mad with my husband and kids," the mother-of-four recalls the difficult moments in the six-sunday ward.
She and her husband also considered signing a reversal, including because of the insensitive attitude of one of the doctors.
In the end, however, this did not happen, and the doctors released Eva and the twins into home care.
Stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
Quite a large family can be aurding.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric biplane and cramped conditions.
The house did not increase, but Vasek made Eva happy by installing a gas cooker to make preparing food for six people more comfortable.
If he's not right, we'll take turns taking turns in a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or smostness of the house.
So far, we've put together very nicely, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to keep in a small space and we sometimes cross rolling babies, but at least we are all close, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side to any situation.
Your work as a lighting man in a film is no guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes goes out on the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
At the age of 60, he says he can physically manage the care of family finances and children, but how long will he be?
"I realize that because of our age difference, I will one day be the one to support this family," Eva admits flatly when asked about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four kids, I'm not a big deal for my employer.
And when it gets worse, my husband and I can take turns taking a cab, jokes the sympathetic blonde.
Apple has had a yo-yo effect.
It's all the displays.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a stronger chassis, or a touch-recognition display are, in short, the virtues of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The last two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weights of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
Apple's trend so far has been that every new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
Only the third and fourth generations were an exception, whose weight increased slightly compared to previous iPhones.
The two-gram difference in weight to the new product was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case with new iPhones.
Compared to last year's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, the weight of the smaller model increased by 14 grams, and for the larger one by a full 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is no wonder that last year's affair of bending in Apple's pockets was a considerable torment.
The novelty chassis is made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But displays have a much greater impact on it.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology to make displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, the display had to be equipped with an additional layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the displays of new iPhones has thus more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For a smaller iPhone, from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of a larger one, from 19 to 40 grams.
With the iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component used.
The weight of only 143 grams is then achieved with this novelty thanks to the fat-off of the pee, which touched most of the remaining components.
For a larger model, the most difficult element used is the battery, but its weight has not changed from its predecessor.
Even in this case, the biggest increase is evident in the display.
The weight of the 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
How practical the new display technology will be will only become apparent during use.
First-time users will be able to try it out as early as Friday, September 25, when iPhone 6s and 6s Plus sales will begin in select countries.
Have the breakfast flakes been champions for tens of thousands of years?
In Grotta Paglicci, Italy, archaeologists have succeeded in finding a find that opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of modern man's settlement from different eras, including murals, tool residues and so on and so on.
But in layer 23A, which according to the tools dates back about 30,000 years, scientists have discovered something that is very reminiscent of the remnants of a breakfast buffet.
Traces of oat grains were found on the spot, which apparently went through the process of making such popular flakes.
During it, the grains are first soaked today, then dryed, removed from the packaging, the so-called regiment, then steamed and pressed flat.
Grains that appear to have been heated or scalded were discovered in the Paglicci Cave, and then probably crushed between two millstones - at least that's what the traces of use on the two stones in the cave suggest.
Thus, scientists were unable to prove in their publication for the journal PNAS that there was a complete process of making flakes in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly warm is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before the emergence of agriculture.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have overtaken agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station reports at the Brno City Transport Company.
So I listened once again to the report of the names of the stops in the trolleybus: Ustisákov, Ghost, Phrase, Spratecká.
Sure, the trolleybus was a bit noisier, so the male voice report was somewhat less understandable than before when the stops were reported in a woman's voice.
A woman's voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic, it is more recognizable than a deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know which ones, no one asked me, but they certainly chose that from studio recordings made in complete silence, which, of course, sounded quite different from the noise of the bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for a good few decades, so I know the correct names of all these stops by heart, so I do not need these reports, but foreigners from somewhere else who are not familiar with Brno and for which these reports are primarily intended may be confused and can then claim at the final destination where they accidentally arrived that the stop they were supposed to get off at , has not been reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of announcer - but better again the announcer - should be done again, and this time tinted with the usual traffic noise and the rumble of the engine, in which the whining of the speaker on the bus is almost lost.
So that we do not have to listen to the names of the stations Water Heršpice, Šmírova, or then Submersible in the creaking shanna to which I transferred in Komárov.
I suppose my old man's hearing didn't deteriorate that much at once during the one day the stop announcer changed.
I understood the reports pretty well before that day.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the track record.
Today, few people know what the biggest and smartest parties were under the so-called comprehensive vetting.
I took the liberty of remembering it.
The bus was late.
I bumped into the dispatcher's office the moment the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't meet comrade chief, he came a minute before you, and he doesn't seem to be in the mood," the dispatcher remarked as I entered my arrivals book.
Thanks, I'll be careful.
Text me that I'm going around the precincts to review a little mechanization.
It's not going to work, there's a background check today.
Everybody's sick of it, it's horrible.
What's going on, then?
"You'll see," said the dispatcher.
Next time, you'll be, too.
I ran out into the hallway.
Then the door of the chief's office opened and the chief appeared.
Uptight, stone-faced, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
"Good morning, Chief," I said respectfully, quickly buttoning up two buttons of my uniform.
"Good morning," came the reply, and I rushed to the second floor, not realizing the cold, ominous tone with which the old man had answered.
"You're messing around," said Eva, an elderly lady I had great respect for.
She said she was even a chief before her comrades deposed her.
There's a background check, and you're going to be here, like,
How many times have I asked what these comprehensive background checks are, but no one really wants to talk about it.
They say they're every three years, they all have to go to them, and it's very unpleasant.
At least for some.
I'll see you then.
I pulled a fascikl from the drawer with periodic reports, and then I pulled the phone.
"It's Holcman, come to me right away," said the chief's voice.
What's bothering you?
Now we've met and nothing ..." I mumbled, but no one answered me, each with only his thoughts.
"Hello, Comrade Chief, I have come at your command," I said, and entered the chief's office.
The chief was sitting at his desk looking at some papers.
"Comrade mechanizer," he said after a while, without raising his head and still looking carefully at the papers, "I don't like your behavior at all."
He threw the papers on the table, leaned back into the back of his chair, and stared at me with the usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I was unsumed.
What's going on?
Just yesterday, the Deputy Minister praised the fact that I had worked very well during my few months in office and that he was very happy with me.
That the chief was very good at pulling me out of the platoon for distancing himself.
And now this?
You realize you're a track distance technician, and you have to act accordingly.
The kind of greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I stuttered that I had used such a greeting since childhood, that I had been so raised and that I saw nothing wrong with it.
For a chief, it was like a red turkey rag.
"You're on the socialist railroad, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of the job," said the smourding chief.
Besides, you're still confusing your superiors.
One day you say "sir" and the next you say "comrade."
But I'm not the chief to you, I'm comrade chief.
The deputy are comrades, the top liners are comrades of the high-liners!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, Mr... Comrade Chief, but... But I greeted you with a common civic greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and that honor work, or comrade ... Know... I'm not in the party...
"It's not your preference that you're not in the party," said the chief coldly, who had calmed down a bit in the meantime.
Well, we'll talk about it.
Anyway, remember, you don't have that chair upstairs prepaid for retirement.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something wasn't his priority, it didn't look good with the person.
He stabbed me for a moment with a cold, prickly look, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his condescending lingo.
He was only a few years older, and he was playing god, actually comrade god.
Jovial, pompous, authoritarian, arrogant, as he currently saw fit.
He was all re howed at.
Well, he's the chief.
In fact, not all of them, the chairman of the party organization, as well as all party members, told him.
But the chief was known to many, especially those for whom he could exercise his superiority.
He just wiped me out for complete.
I thought something about my ass, and it took a lot of effort not to shoot him in the face.
But then I wouldn't go back to the pickaxe, let alone continue as a railway officer.
What would I make two kids out of?
And a house under construction!
I was crying, but I was in control.
I'm not going to make him happy.
"That's all, you can go," the chief concluded, looking again at the papers in his hand.
I was summoned at 11:30.
Everyone in the office was already there, and when asked what and how, they said yes, that it would be okay.
Only Jožin said bitingly, as was his custom, that we could not be thrown out, because the work would have to be done by the comrade chief himself and his faithful, and that there is no danger.
He emphasized the word "comrade" as if he knew what the old man had wiped me for this morning.
There was a nice gathering at the chief's office.
Comrade Chief at his desk and at the long advisory table, other comrades who should have decided on my official existence or non-existence.
Cadre, chairman of the ROH, registrar of personnel, special purpose officer, something like a contrite in the army, and deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from a long way.
An ordinary track worker, he was slit by sleepers or forks throwing gravel.
But also a former guard.
It was rumored that he was no fun at the time, a pretty beast.
Evil tongues claimed that he went to school in the seventh grade, didn't learn anything, couldn't do anything.
And when the crime was abolished, he ended up on a pickaxe.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief motioned for me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an uncool cones in my throat.
Cadre read the opinion from the civic committee from his place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, two kids, and so on and so forth.
So far, I thought, and I've been breathing better.
Then an opinion from the party's street organization.
He copied the civil committee report, perhaps written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of longtime party members refused to appear before the review board and subsequently resigned from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The cadre noticed and stopped reading.
The chief motioned to continue.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the SSM city committee, and there I was acquired as the party's nominee.
Regardless of the parents who left the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married, and I had a wedding in church, in addition to the National Committee.
I have failed the party's trust in the worst way.
That's why I was removed from the ranks of her candidates.
But that wasn't enough!
I had both children bapted, and even my mother, when she died, I gave a church funeral, even though she was a former party member.
All of this shows a negative attitude towards the leadership of the party.
When the cadre finished reading, only the tapping of the chief's pencil on the tabletop interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was far away somewhere.
At the same time, I kept telling myself "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans." What did I get into?
Why didn't I stay with the blacksmiths?
I could fix switches without some background check.
But now?
She took her career as a railway officer before she even started.
Get back in the platoon?
I don't think that's going to work.
"Comrade, how did you examine the comrade here?" the chief interrupted in a tense silence, asking about the cadre.
Well, according to a report from a previous job.
Do you have it here?
Apparently, the cadre didn't get it twice.
He blinked nervously at the scraps of sweat, as if he had been veered himself.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief some paper.
"Well," said the chief, with a hint of joviality, which was often a harbinger of a storm.
At first glance, full of praise, taught with distinction, graduated from the industrial industry, worked in the task wage as a locksmith, the standard was met on average at one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essentials are missing.
Where did you get that assessment from, comrade?" he said again to the cadre, who felt that it was beginning to turn against him, and that he might not even be a cadre very soon.
The comrade here gave it to me on board.
That's enough for you?
"Well, when he joined us, he went to the precinct in the platoon," said the cadre.
And there are no reports, his was kind of extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were in technical position, this piece of paper was enough for you," said the chief dryly.
The cadre blinked nervously and had no answer.
"Never mind, we'll discuss it later," the chief concluded, and the cadre was clearly relieved.
He's made it for now.
"What about you, comrade?" said the chief again.
Suddenly he reprim smprims me, so it's over!
My eyes went dark, I was saluted by the heat.
A torrent of remorse and accusations ensued, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world who deserved no mercy.
That by planting an incomplete report, I misled a comrade cadre officer, not understanding why the report was incomplete when I received it from a cadre in the factory.
I am also an antisocialist element who, at a time of building real socialism, supports, or even participates in, the rust of religious darkness.
That, that, there was a lot I'd done, or maybe I'd still do it, and I prayed quietly that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I left the scene of the mechanism.
I didn't care if they took my pickaxe.
That's a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people I was in comrade chief's eyes.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief," said the party leader suddenly, emphatically interrupting the chief's levites.
The comrade here made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did stupid!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than locking the door to his side for a while!
In order to reopen them, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is once again worthy of our trust.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is he so well-read or parroted phrases from party trainings and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who's going to give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat misguided comrade in his efforts to remedy it!
It's your party duty that no one can get rid of!
In fact, it's a party duty for all of us, too.
The comrade here must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes, but also loves.
When the Chairman was finished, no one even looked.
No one expected such a turnaround.
At least me.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade Chairman," the chief said icyly, trying to take the initiative again.
If you'd let me finish, you'd have heard that's the conclusion I was headed for.
They all nod their heads in agreement, but you could tell they didn't believe a word he said.
"So I was confirmed as an independent officer of basic care," I said as I returned to the office, and then I cried.
It's a good fact that everyone but Engineer Eva was at lunch.
She listened taintedly to my incoherent account of fresh experiences, and I calmed down.
When I was done, she asked if I wanted a cup of coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put the water on the cooker and prepared the mugs.
Meanwhile, she was talking about cadre practices.
As one assessment, often full of praise, is put in a person's hand, and the other, in which there is any dirt, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I was supposed to be, but on a pickaxe, so the factory comrades didn't know where to send it.
And our cadre?
He just cares where he eats or drank, and that's how it turned out.
"He's going to get it from the old man," she said mischieguingly.
I'm sure he won't like it today.
Watch out for him anyway, he's very vestible.
And the party chairman?
Basically a much worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from a pickaxe with great power.
The coffee water began to smourd, and then the office filled with the smourd smourding of just-poured coffee.
I threw a sugar cube into the cup and mixed the hot potion in silence.
I hope I'm out of the woods.
I'm not going to get shoo-in now, and the next background checks are three years away.
Anyway, Comrade Chief won't forget me today.
It was published in the anthology LITERATE ON TRACK II by EPIKA
The symbol of the village came to life.
The windbreaker wheel above Chlum is spinning again after years.
It can be seen from afar, as it is located on a fifteen-meter high mast.
People in the area call him "the fan on Chlum."
For a municipality with 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem that the municipality acquired on the occasion of the meeting of natives in 2010.
"We asked for a coat of arms at the time and of course we wanted to have the fan on the sign, everyone knows it in the area," said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a kind of memento of the present: it reminds us of a time when the people here fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries has been a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlum representatives decided on a solution that then suited until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the turn-off to Číchov they had a seven-meter deep well dug.
Three years later, the well was supplemented with a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into a reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc from Hranice in Moravia with a cost of CZK 2,400," says a commemorative inscription on the ground-floor wall of the mast structure.
The pump expired in 1971 after several repairs and falls of the wind wheel.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the struggle for water began to be written: on that day in Chlum, a new water supply began to serve.
The wind pump remained only a malfunctioning municipal symbol and a rarity.
The dominant was put into operation at this year's meeting of the natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlums decided to repair the wind bike again and get it back on the move.
They had a replica of the original bike made - reduced by half a meter in diameter.
The bike was mounted on a mast, but had to be brought down that same year.
The replica manufacturer did not choose the appropriate material and the bike could not resist wind gusts.
Then the Chlum dominant rested for several years, disassembled under the roof.
Since June this year, however, the high-mast bike has been spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the village had the replica of the bike modified and re-sourded it to the top of the iron tower.
But the bike draws utility water from the well only into the overshot blind arm.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected it because there was little water in the well.
At least it was imming.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the wind wheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again," explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where a wind bike has reached the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of its kind in the whole Highlands.
They have a similar element in their coat-of-arms in honour of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Green Mountain in the Vyškov region, in Kuželov in the Hodonín region, Partutovice in Přerovsko or in Polici in the Vsetín region.
No offense, but I don't know Lafata, said Tripoli supporter Goian.
"I remember the game against Slavia very well, and so do my goal, like everyone in my career," the 34-year-old Goian smiled at the pre-match press conference.
Georghe Hagi coached us back then, it was a shame we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
Only with the difference that we won't lose this time," Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 games for the Romanian national team, is a key supporter of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face raids from the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says Spartan Hybš about the Greek duel.
And he has some semys about what might happen to him on Thursday night.
I know Fatai well, who played in Astra, Romania, with my brother Luciano.
I saw all their fights at the time.
I know he's a very good striker, that's why he went to Sparta, Goian said.
He did not name any other footballers from the Prague club, so there was a direct question as to whether he also knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech League and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and stared at czech journalists with a slightly resuoilful look.
The helpless look on his face said, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of quiet, he lowered his fire.
We saw some videos and noticed that Sparta plays a lot of team.
He's got really good players.
And Lafata?
No offense, but I don't know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know that very well about Goian.
"He has experience from bigger clubs, you could say he holds the Asteras defence, he is their organizer of the game," observed Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian may have had his best years, but he boasts a very interesting football resume.
At one time he was interested in Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, both Manchester United and City, but from Steaua he headed to Palermo, Italy, and also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We expect an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly plays in European Cups, fighting to win the Czech League.
For me, he's the favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in the room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very much looking forward to his czech opponent.
So am I.
But on the whole team, I can say we're going to fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering joining the Prague Stock Exchange.
The new headquarters should be Kofola in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading the company's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the group's headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are mainly legal and administrative and do not have a de facto impact on what is happening in the company, says Daniel Buryš, Chief Financial Officer of Kofola Group.
"In connection with the transfer of the group's registered office, shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange."
Due to the entry into the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is completing a prospectus of a security, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding's registered office and the related transfers of shares will take the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating.
Therefore, no shares will be offered for subscription to the public or to new investors as part of this operation.
"Any offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so choose - at a later date, either in Q4 2015 or Q1 2016," the company said.
The company has previously said that a possible share offering could consist of issuance of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the Stock Exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares also on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Test of the objectivity of Czech Television in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the coverage of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time, the broadcast of the main news session of Czech Television.
And how did it stand up?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can broadcast today's Czech Television Events broadcast.
About 80% of the news coverage was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Except for the first minute, when ČT reported on the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the attacks of migrants on police officers euphemistically ran out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current promigrant propaganda was already going - judge for yourself the names of the individual reports.
Criticism of NGOs - a great space for NGOs that criticise the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but as a chance.
The journey of refugees - CT consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee and not migrant.
What is striking is that ČT consistently uses only and only footage of young children and women in illustrative footage.
In the same broadcast, she herself stated that of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic, 80% are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that is unprecedented from communist agitations.
I must say, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once took up a block of flats, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
My fish and game moved into the umakart toilet.
Domestic dots, insects with imperfect transformation, i.e., not going through the transformation from caterpillar to beetle, and the cub looks like an adult individual, only it is small and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me, and I didn't want to kill them.
First by hand and later chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystals for their disposal.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
But it destroyed them successfully.
Later, I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with a kind of juvenileizer, which the ants brought to the nest, and then he did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I took a detour.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I increasingly tended to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
Moreover, I have learned from my life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success, and one pest can be replaced by another.
True, with fleas and bedbugs, I wouldn't be embarrassed to get worse by killing them.
In the new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fishes weren't crawling around our necks, they should calmly eat the flakes of renegade skin, some invisible eyelashes and the like.
Their calm existence was disturbed by a spider over time.
It was a common kind of scathing that had long resuased on the ceiling.
We thought he was living off occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Since he spent several years with us, we found that he mainly feeds on fish and that he probably kept their numbers at a bearable numerical state.
By intimate regular contact at every need done, we found out that it was a female.
We witnessed romantic courtship with a partner about a third smaller, carefully tinging on the fibers of the web so that it would not be eaten before it reached the desired cocoation.
It took about three days for them not to move or respond to our inspections.
Under the toilet bowl where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried-up male next to the female.
Then the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought it was over, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
In part, they were eaten by their mother, partly spread out elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she went elsewhere or passed away, we don't know, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the bathroom's great-ocible.
For some time, she watched cautiously from the ceiling, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our non-aggression as a friendship.
The number of somewhat multiplied fish had decreased again, and the spider was calmly minding its normal activities to provide food.
Our ecosystem has not changed all year.
In the meantime, our daughter has reached an age where using a potty was already a disgrace.
So far, we have tolerated it, but the eternal pouring of its contents has already been ate.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more forcefully.
Her daughter, however, found an excuse to maintain her habit in the spider, which she could see very well when wiping.
Our talk of seeing the spider didn't take any luck in the house.
Weeping and roaring, she made her potty.
There was no need.
There came a time when the spider had to command, in order to develop the daughter.
It's up to me.
He was taken into a glass and banished over the balcony to a garden somewhere.
I said good-bye to him as a friend, but after so long cohabitation, I still felt ugly, like I was firing a relative.
We assumed that the dots would start to appear more often and begin to multiply geometrically.
World wonders, a week or two, none of them showed up.
I started speculating about the cause.
I wondered if the ant-like spider had somehow made them there, that the toilet environment wasn't as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first pieces of medium size appeared, and they were teeming again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I found out that their link to the spider must have been caused by the fact that if they didn't see it, that it was hidden in some other place and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection to their predator, and his rapid disappearance caused some kind of alarm reaction.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their sight.
They showed some shyness, but that they would respond to hand waving or quick movements, no.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she's forgotten about the potty.
All that remains is to attract some spider again.
I'm already airing my wish, and I hope they didn't give up on me after the execution.
Otherwise, we'd have to use Cyclone B.
Ten statements by Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The statements of a brilliant scientist from the last century will probably never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to delve so deeply into everything that the product was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He came to the consciousness of people primarily with his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic proportions.
It is also impossible to forget its explanation of the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the descriptiveness itself and the set of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity are so complex for many that they prefer easy proportions for closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he hadn't found a brilliantly simplified form of explanation for this, too: An hour near your lover seems a minute; a minute in a hot oven seems an hour - and that is relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing from his whole plethora of famous quotes these ten that literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to do them.
Only two things are infinite.
Space and human stupidity.
I'm not entirely sure about the first one.
No amount of experimentation can ever prove that I was right.
But the only one who can prove me wrong at any time.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table reflects a mess in the mind, what then reflects an empty table?
I don't know what's going to be fought in World War III, but in the fourth, it's going to be sticks and rocks.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but none to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that my life would depend on, I'd spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The world's hardest thing to understand income tax.
Finally, I cannot forgive myself for not edging Einstein's formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula applies: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y rest and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are awaiting changes worth 1.5 billion.
"It is a success, considering that all four of them have been in the black all year," said The Governor Stanislav Mišák.
The total profit of regional facilities at the moment is about CZK 32 million.
This is mainly due to higher reimbursements from insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
This fact also shows that, after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kromeriz, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, constructions are coming up, which together will cost almost CZK 1.5 billion.
The long period when we mainly bought equipment was over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, top health care cannot be done, explained the plans of the regional deputy for health, Lubomir Nečas.
All hospitals are looking forward to the changes.
The builders will be in hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, they are now selecting the supplier of a new internal pavilion for almost CZK 300 million.
They have an extension of dialysis planned in Kromeriz.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new interna for about 200 million to this year's open central pavilion.
And Zlín's Bata Hospital is awaiting the long-overdue construction of a new central income and an internment, for which three quarters of a billion will be needed.
In all cases, these are fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors," said Věra Prousková, director of the hospital, for example, on the construction of the Vsetín interna.
The five-storey building is to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for interna and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and an intensive care unit.
More comfort for patients.
The changes, which are especially known to patients, will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, they have only one toilet on the floor, beds are non-adjustable, windows leak and paramedics do not have adequate conditions for work.
"For example, our interna was built 35 years ago and is now on the verge of its lifespan," said Pavel Calábek, director of the Zlín hospital.
Within a few years, it will therefore be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with urgent reception.
Doctors and patients will thus have all acute wards in one place, in addition to new premises.
The same model already has half finished Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already standing, and within three years there will be an intern.
"We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own funds," explained director Petr Sládek.
It is this hospital that can afford its own funding.
Its profit is still the highest, and it did not even make it to the loss two years ago, when the Zlín hospital, for example, faced a loss of almost 200 million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and effectively manage costs throughout the hospital," said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients from kromeriz hospital will also see improvements.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go into repairs, new equipment and reconstructions.
Already this year, the repair of the sea station will be completed, then the addition of dialysis will begin, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance imaging will begin.

No one explained to me how I should keep accepted refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
After negotiations with his European colleagues, Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (ČSSD) complains that other countries are pushing the Czech Republic to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they reject any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how he should keep the allocated refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
"We did not receive an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text," Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position with which you came to the meeting of the European Union's Interior and Foreign Ministers?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have visions, they're going somewhere, they've got relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we are able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they are redistributed.
We can't imagine it.
We did not receive an answer, which is why we wanted quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, i.e. registration points, border control, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year, and we're saying this is the way.
But saying quotas solve everything?
Not long ago, we were dealing with forty thousand, now it's a hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep these people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all the people crossing us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as a destination country, receive asylum with us, have the ambition to come to us, but the interest of people from this migration wave, i.e. from Syria and other countries, is limited to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don't really want to come to us, but we've already committed to accepting 1500 people.
Wouldn't it be possible to accept more of them in this way?
We are committed to accepting 1,500 people, but on parole.
We said: functional hotspots, border control, military operation.
Even the 1,500 are coming, and we're going to have 1,100 people to handle the asylum procedure.
They'll come to our detention facility, and we'll treat them the same way we treat the ones we've picked up.
It is a big question, and we will be debating this with Europe, whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or hungary.
Because Europe treats this in such a way that if they are registered, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet in place, it may happen that we will not keep even the 1100 on the territory of the Czech Republic and they will go to Germany again when they arrive.
If we can detain them during the asylum procedure, we will deal with them through the asylum procedure.
If it is the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of them receive international protection, according to European statistics.
Then they will receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think that these people will once again end up in the target countries.
Then there are 400 people who will be rescheduling.
This is the second project that is still under way, and we have only made progress there in discussing with the churches the possibility that they could help them get jobs, accommodation and so on.
But that's a very long run.
You said that at the ministerial meeting, the other states were unwilling to discuss with us.
But isn't it that the Czech Republic is only rejecting quotas, but is not offering any solidarity step to unblock the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is a solidarity move?
If the Federal Republic of Germany says an incentive that all migrants from Syria can reach them, the message will spread in hours across all camps across Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It encourages another migration wave heading to Germany because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders - simply to deter the migration waves, to help those in need, and to separate the economic migrants.
Let them know they don't stand a chance.
Fifty thousand Kosovars came to Germany last year alone.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's office.
If we could separate them and not accept them, or accept them only according to the needs of the economies, the 50% of what social systems are now issuing in vain to them could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
Now it's eighty, the first day it was twelve.
How far is this going to go to tighten border controls?
We were afraid of being taken by hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we're handling.
We still have several hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we detain will be returning to Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones taking these people away from us, hungary is complicated and the Greeks - that is a completely useless story.
So where's the tipping point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be a few hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two, three consecutive days, will drain our capacity enough to come up with crisis plans.
Then I've agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're in phone contact several times a day.
If the situation were to arise, the government could sit down de facto immediately and, in one resolution, decide to strengthen the police with an army, say customs administration, or prison service.
The last resort is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can get this far.
Be aware that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we have a Schengen border only at the airport.
I do not know what would have to happen for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I do not want to spread alarms.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that Hungarians will try to divert the migratory flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost not at all.
Slavia paid off a large part of her debts at the last minute.
They're trying to prevent a bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid its debts.
Even the footballers got their money's money.
Football Slavia went to court for the first time on Tuesday due to insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after Online Services from Pacific Samoa filed a proposal for about CZK 20 million.
Slavia's lawyer Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours not to declare her in decline over Slavia.
And it has to be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that the previous week, the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC became the new owner of Slavia, as well as the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně.
Apparently, money came in from the new owners at the last minute.
This is proved by Slavia's comments before Tuesday's court hearing - the Vršovice Club sent tens of millions of crowns owed on Monday, just one day before the court hearing.
"Everything was paid between 11 September and 15 September," said lawyer Slavie Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or Czech midfielder Mario Ličkova.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenicke.
Already on Friday, the club paid the outstanding fees of the Prague 10 district.
Thus, only claims that Slavia disputes remain de facto part of the insolvency dispute.
Either, according to the club, the liabilities were not incurred at all, or they are being litigation.
However, we are prepared to pay the sums in the event of the loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can prove with an account statement," lawyer Mládková told the judge.
"Everything that has been overdue is paid," mládková said, adding that only outstanding or disputed liabilities are unpaid.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts in question.
All evidence will then be assessed.
A decision can therefore not be expected until November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the hearing to resume on November 3rd.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

FastMig X is a representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of cutting-edge technologies, modular-integrated hardware and software delivers benefits and a rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
From welding structural steel to welding of special alloys, as well as from welding of coarse materials to welding of thin sheets, from workshop applications to welding in shipyards.
The incredible amount of welding curves, simple setting and expandability of the welding source allow you to react quickly to a change in requirements, leading to reduced downtime, the need to re-adjust the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding by high-end welding processes developed by Kemppi to ensure higher welding productivity and quality.
Time is lost and materials are not wasted or faulty welds repaired.
Flexibility is ensured, there is less downtime, more welding and higher profit.
It is this year's novelty, which premiered in Nitra, where she also won a gold medal.
We greatly appreciate these honors as they confirm the exceptionality of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers boast similar systems, but due to differences in software and parameter management, FastMig X is one of the world's top manufacturers.
Delivery times, which are around three weeks, are certainly pleasant for those interested.
We have already established our first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will definitely expand after the Brno fair.
We have been regular participants for over twenty years and almost always our business results are better than before, says Miroslav Streichsbier, head of Kemppi store in Pilsen, on the part of ARC-H.
FastMig X is a modular system, therefore the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
Blanka could be built so she wouldn't fall.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka could have been hit more safely, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built in such a way that there would be no two soil sinkholings in Prague's Stromovka, says The Production Director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel, Alexander Butovič.
He said it wednesday evening during a press tour of the tunnel.
But it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive, he said.
It will open to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a compromise between price and security.
"The tunnel could have been tunneled more safely, but the costs are rising exponentially," Butovich said.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the ground fell just a few steps from where the safer and more cautious method began to come from.
"If these measures had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive," Butovich said.
The Blanka Tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovka, in 2010 the land collapsed at the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav Director Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told Euro weekly.
According to the original plan, the construction was to cost CZK 17 billion.
Add to this the VAT, which has jumped twice in the construction period, out of seventeen billion you have twenty-one.
Add to that technology, land purchases and engineering, indexation and the like, it's $29 billion, which is not that far from the 37, Whitehead said.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx gains mixed, fiscal outlook downgrade for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the latest quarter and a huge drop in its full-year profit forecast due to low freight demand and higher ground division costs.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The downgrade comes despite an average interest rate increase of 4.9 percent, which will take effect in January. 4, and higher surcharges for the ground transport of heavy or large packages that start in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, chairman and CEO of the company, said the company "performed strongly despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx raised $692 million, up 6 percent from a year ago.
Earnings per share were $2.42, less than $2.44 a share, forecast by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenues in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
In the last quarter, land revenues rose 29 percent, but operating profit was essentially the same because of higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.
Express unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while profit fell in the freight business due to higher labor prices.
In pre-market trading about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
In their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week seated at Honduran's 27-foot mahogany table, deciding whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Towering above them at one end of the central bank ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The central bank has a dual charge from Congress: maximizing American employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced On Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to start weaning off unprecedented stimulus in the form of near-zero short-term interest rates on the ground since late 2008.
Although most data show solid economic growth, recent turbulence in world financial markets could already scare the cautious Fed into adding to volatility by raising its benchmark federal funds rate - no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch in the first place," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus &Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the heightened uncertainty surrounding the global market already gives them sufficient justification to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is causing nervousness in financial markets.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with only about a 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a stock market decline if the Fed raises rates only if policymakers soften the decline by promising that further increases are in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers would hold rates steady this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed raises rates now," he says.
If Fed policymakers did, "they would have to go to extremes in their program statement and hold hands with financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets by removing uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared well on its way to raising the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects to raise rates this year through spring and early summer, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labor market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of pick-up.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank's annual 2% target, Fed policymakers argue that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness in the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to squam down late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record in May as investors feared that China's slowing economy would drag down global growth.
The market rebounded somewhat this month, and the Dow is now losing only nearly 10% of its May high.
For Fed policymakers, the turmoil in the market gives a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
"In the absence of what has happened in financial markets and reports of weakness in the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, there would have been a tightening at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on for the latest developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main interests, so technically it should not be included in their decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the whole world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere suggestion by then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed might "narrow" their monetary expansion in the market triggered convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly closely interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to follow developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better understand the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth-management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated financial market movements that seem incoherent with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy-making committee, which pushed for a rate hike, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over three sessions "Despite limited identifiable effects on US growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should prioritize concerns about financial stability only during a major crisis like the market meltdown of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest turmoil is not even close to that level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of a rate hike because the markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get to the top.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's Chinatown, not Thai quarter.
The market/warehouse is the only contact point that offers a stunning array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and festive decorations.
There is even a car part if you need a little engine oil.
The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to crawl through all the aisles.
If you're hungry about all this shopping, check out the LAX-C BBQ Express for a meal.
The internal business stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various collection points.
What's in stock: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and lots of items are sold in bulk.
The limit of fresh products includes special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The spread of meat is large, for example, fish - the staff behind the counter will wash and bone it, even dry it for you if you so wish,
A good part of the shop is left to a massive freezing compartment where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork guts, fish balls, regional sausages, over-the-counter semi-finished products and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as single families and individuals.
Wide streets meet shopping carts and forklifts.
Find: Fresh monthong durian next to the cash register stand.
Where it is located: The store is in an industrial area of Los Angeles, surrounding the suburbs of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the shop may be occupied, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Speed on highways will stay the same.
The acceleration to 150 km/h was rejected by the Chamber of Deputies.
On selected sections of motorways it will not be possible to increase the maximum speed limit up to 150 km/h under favourable conditions.
On Tuesday, the House made the decision by agreeing to a Senate amendment that rejected the speed increase.
The amendment to the Road Act will now head to the President.
President Miloš Zeman had already said at the end of April that he would veto a law allowing a 150-kilometre speed.
Transport Minister Dan Ťok (for YES) was also opposed to the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network is not yet built for such a speed.
Ťok supported the Senate version of the bill in front of MPs on Tuesday.
The approved amendment will now allow speed increases from 90 to 110 kilometres per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-current ones, in line with the government's original proposal.
The House first extended this option to highways that could be used in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km/h, but the Senate refused.
Members have now accepted his proposal.
Senators, with the approval of the Minister of Transport, also removed from the amendment the right of the traffic police to have the last say in the regulation of local roads, which are taken care of by municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the House, also provides for sewers, water pipes or public lighting cables to be stored longitudinally beneath the road surface.
Municipalities would thus save money on the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land in use.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to deal with towed vehicles to which owners do not subscribe.
Municipalities could now sell towed vehicles that their owners do not claim within six months of notification of the tow.
Municipalities will also be able to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on second- and third-class roads under the threat of fines even for forwarding companies.
The amendment also abolishes the possibility of introducing electronic vignettes instead of existing paper vignettes, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí expressor is going to trial.
He faces 10 years for overpriced welcoming people.
The case concerns the allegedly overpriced Welcome to The People project.
The police also wanted to prosecute Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not issue it.
According to the legal classification of the case, both face up to 10 years in prison.
The trial is scheduled for two days in October.
According to the public prosecutor, Mandík and Macík caused at least one million crowns of damage, according to the indictment.
The applicant relies on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, the former members of the city's management, in their office, wrongfully allowed the company that organized the welcoming of the residents to gain property benefit.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered the then head of the Municipal Department of Municipal Services, Education and Culture to address five connected companies in the tender.
When another company entered the competition offering the lowest price, the town hall canceled the competition.
The contract was then to be entrusted to the administrator by the city administrator, and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid out at least an extra million.
Both accused, led by the aim of ensuring that Darothore was awarded a public contract for the organisation of the Welcome to The Municipalities event in Usti nad Labem, acted in a long and coordinated way at least contrary to the requirement to act with due managerial care, writes the public prosecutor.
At the same time, they were aware that Darothore would charge Usti nad Labem a price that would be disproportionately increased compared to the fair value of the services actually provided, following the award of this contract.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than FIVE MILLION CROWNS for the project.
In the end, the city paid out only one part, about CZK 1.7 million, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid was overpriced by at least a million crowns.
Mandík has previously denied any violation of the law.
I didn't commit any crime, I'm innocent.
I don't understand this fabricated case, the former mayor said earlier, noting that the city under his leadership had only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
Between 2008 and 2010, roxy ii provided the event.
"It was under the same conditions, for the same money," Mandík added.
The criminologists originally wanted to charge Representative Kail, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not put it up for prosecution.
The criminologists have therefore postponed the case in her case, but are counting on kail to be charged after her term of office is over.
Welcoming the public was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift cheque for CZK 5,000 for the purchase of children's supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly released a dog at the fugitive.
Then they got the press to delete the footage.
Hungarian police reportedly briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia, forcing him to delete footage of a police dog allegedly knocking a refugee to the ground.
However, the Hungarian Government disputes this accusation.
The alleged incident took place on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing a cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke to cross the border with Serbia.
Police intervened against the refugees, and one of them had a Syrian attack a dog with a basket on his nose.
The dog of the man who shouted "Please, please, I'm a fugitive," rolled over, Muzi says.
Muzi was noticed by one of the policemen and wouldn't let him leave.
The journalist was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Officers took Muzi to a dark spot near the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had on tape.
Then they ordered him to delete the footage.
In this way, Muzi lost the result of two days' work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt threatened because there were dogs nearby.
Ap sent a protest letter to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the police's behavior unacceptable and said that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not having to worry about the government destroying legally obtained material.
Kovács disputed Muzi's account of the events, citing a police report.
He said the police just wanted a reporter to show them if they were in some of the footage, which they said they were entitled to.
When they found out they were not there, they didn't force him to delete anything.
"Dogs can bark - they're trained to scare off and scare a little, but they certainly don't attack," says Kovács.
Unpredictable Champions League.
Win at City will kick-start us, believes Juventus
"It's disappointing, I don't think we deserved to lose," said Manuel Pellegrini, the home City coach.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team created many opportunities, but we had the ball on the kickers longer.
"The reason for the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus just scored two beautiful goals," said Pellegrini, whose team scored in a competitive match after a long 636 minutes.
Last season's runners-up Juventus were exactly the opposite before their encounter - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, they have only a point as defending champions and are 2-4 up in 16th place in the table.
That's why the turnaround at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, kick us in," believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supporters - Pirlo, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
Pogba, Manchukic and Morata took their place in Manchester.
"That's right, this victory is very important, hopefully it will put us on a winning streak," Morata hopes.
Because when we're on it, we're one of the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the attacking phase.
This is the result my players deserve.
"We could have made it 0-2 before our equalising goal, but Gianluigi held us up," coach Allegri praised goalkeeper Buffon.
"We blew some good chances," said Yaya Touré, the City midfielder.
We have to take experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Farewell Angela, farewell old Germany II.
Before we go on about the immigrant issue, we should realize that the whole media frenzy around here is run by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let's stop for a minute.
Nowadays, newspapers and media are full of babies carrying their parents on the dusty roads of the exodus.
And this automatically makes a person - that is, a European person - feel guilty and compassionate.
Well, it's not just desperate children who come here, notice in the footage of the boats landing on the Greek islands that the little kids can't see that much!
And somehow, recently, pictures of ships heading for Lampedusa, refugees outside the French border near Menton, where thousands of young men lie on the beautiful promenade, have disappeared from our television.
Mostly young black men.
And the pictures from Callais have also disappeared, where these eaters and black men are waiting to see if they can make it through the Channel Tunnel.
I don't think he's getting any more.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the people of Europe.
There was too much falsehood.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it's kind of concealed that they're not just unhappy children from Syria, but also secret - for the elderly: fashionably fashionably fashioned - young men.
Their musculature looks like they just came out of some fitness center.
Just one personal experience.
This summer on the Turkish-Muslim part of Cyprus we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite being private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no hams.
And out of them came young black people.
About 30 men and five women.
Ages between 15 and 30.
They walked into the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes.
They didn't care about this private beach and the staff - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid of them.
They've taken all the sunbeds.
Anyone who wasn't lying on it and was in the sea was unlucky.
They were dressed like they were from an American rapper movie.
On the heads of a cap with a fingernail, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and started feasting.
They occupied the tables around, crammed into the next-seated, seated, ate and white bar guests - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers with children fled the dining terrace somewhere quiet.
Incoming blacks drank beer in thirds - how about in us shows?! - on the beach, they threw empty bottles around.
They kept yelling loudly at each other.
It wasn't English, of course.
Then they went into drinking wine, also straight out of bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool - in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies - screaming and screaming in the water, mothers with children and pensioners ran away in horror, and half an hour later not a single non-black guest was on the beach or in the pool.
They've all disappeared.
Whether someone was Christian or Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to even talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low-to-do way that evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"yes," I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't get it from work," said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, they all had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one of them had a massive cross of gold about 20 centimeters around his neck.
And women were like jewelry stores.
"Are they drug smugglers?"
"You've seen them drink," replied the waiter.
They don't use drugs.
They're smuggling something else entirely.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
However, in June 2105 it was not so important to me.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they know.
Some 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, it has become clear that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and their connected lobbying and economically important groups have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - the now publicly recognised main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, but also the EU's leaders and television, including our own.
For example, recent television pictures of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of pictures of Moscow TELEVISION from August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunbathers at the station, but most importantly - old German - Muslims welcomed their friends.
For weeks they babbled in the news on Czech TELEVISION, as according to some research, almost everyone is in the way of the arrival of emigrants.
But anyone who's only been in Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by further information.
For example, the famous opinion poll organized by ARD - Czech By the Association of Public Broadcasters of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, until a week ago, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees.
That's what our TVs used to do.
But they concealed what broke the next day in Germany: that the poll for the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer wanted any more immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly declared in November 2010, five years ago: "Our efforts at a 'multi-culti' society have completely failed."
She went on to say, "Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society."
"All efforts to coexist like this have completely failed."
In a country of four million Muslims, she said, a strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has failed. They live here with us today, and we've been lying to each other for a while that they won't stay, that one day they'll disappear again.
That's not reality.
A multicultural approach where we tell ourselves that we just live happily ever after, that approach has failed.
He's completely failed.
But even Merkel may not have the strength to go against the mighty Germany and Europe, and especially against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is growing rapidly.
Mr Schulz, president of the European Parliament, SPD MEP, the only one who reportedly does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, this is the one berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play a guard in a concentration camp from a minute ago - has, as he has done more than once.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, with the help of some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of the countries that were victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful, solid Germans?
Who for years have tried, at least externally, to deal with their terrible past as aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those who say that the devil of aggression, superiority, and violence sedation in Germany's soul right?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right to stop the Great Germans' attempts to control the entire centre of Europe with all his might?
When did he say the Great German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was shut down, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Great Germany, which led Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably came back in a different form.
After the Marxists' attempt to control the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of ecology, which, incidentally, was one of the main ideological foreshadunders of Nazism.
We'd say sunshine.
Germany's elites had long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving behind all those anti-atom warriors, enthusiasts seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi motto Our forest must live.
To satisfy restless young people who want to do something different and better everywhere in the world, they have fully sided with anti-planet warming campaigners, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there was also a strongly anti-Semitic - so-called pro-French - and anti-Slavic current in this current, which considered all Slavs to be difficult - since the days of Karl Marx, who, after his parents a Jew, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements by Schulz and German minsters openly threatening disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a German leader.
Which must be listened to without question.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And if we add in the fact that immigrants are a very influenceable group of voters, we have what we have.
And, as always, there is capital behind it, especially the German capital, which suits it, and which is based on the fact that Germany actually controls most of europe's states through banks and the Union.
The pseudo-sunshine industry first led Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiklturalism, and today it has brought home and perhaps even more millions of Muslims.
Who, te again by the voices of sirens, will soon hit a wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see and will start to rebel.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors with force again, again it can infatuate a part of its population - but it seems to be an increasingly small part - ideologically infatuated, but in the end reality, as always, will catch up with it.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when public protests by Germans against incoming Islamists break out?
Who will be helped by Muslims who have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated, to take over local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists, and Germans, watching their country's Islamization with fear, get into it?
What will it do to the Germans, and germany in general, when people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-super-human Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict that has been provoked in Europe by promoting a sunnier ideology, that is, an elitist ideology and essentially totalitarian, and its vissile banks, is growing.
And because of the blunt action against disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbours, this cannot go well.
Finish tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of nosy sellers: scare them to death.
Just knock and the sturdy knocker will knock on you in a way that the weaker nature may not be able to withstand.
The revived head will wipe you out nicely and drive you away even hardened, accompanied (or rather driven away) by a persistent salesman and a revived statue.
Maybe it's a shame you can't get a talking knocker in real life.
Even here, it would be useful to ward off a lot of peek-a-tchs and scumbags.
Oxalis corniculata.
Small weeds that tolerate dry environments.
And so it is located among the outdoor tiles near my residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to expansive weeds, but visually creates a nice impression in terms of flowering.
Among the outdoor tiles is located.
She's erratic, she thrives in our garden.
She likes a quieter environment, is easy to adapt, modest and unpretentious.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth observing and taking pictures of it.
Under the micro-view is only the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.
Brazilian pediatrics company Rio Grande promotes healthy diet while breastfeeding
Brazilian paediatrics company SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding using images of babies sumelting from their breasts painted with images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that supply infants with all the nutrients they need to create a strong immune system.
Thanks to a teeming energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced their children's genetic makeup and protected them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets negatively affected the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates rates as Nine's attempts to take the lead on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's erring to Canberra to cover the cost of the Liberal leadership spill failed to produce a sufficient rating increase for Today.
Nine's morning show screened from the national capital after Tony Abbott's overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long international television series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance didn't seem to matter that much to Aussie TV viewers, as it averaged 397,000 viewers in five capital cities, compared to 330,000 viewers on Today.
Today saw a smaller increase in its ratings compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but the number was only past last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been filling the gap on Sunrise in recent months.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 on Today, compared to 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers in September and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are affecting parliament this morning, my friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a recently-fathered father who decides to move with his two children to a seaside part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson himself could pull off a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result gives a clear yes.
Seven's The X Factor retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed ratings for the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV quiz (5pm to 5.30pm), hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (5:30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 viewers — enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia's first half hour averaged 520,000 viewers and the other half had a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
With The Chase Australia's ratings down from the second night, Nine will be confident hot seat will eventually win at 5.30pm.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

Three in the finale agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who does he choose?
Secrets revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who's going to win The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood is coming to The Bachelor with is shrouded in insurmountable mystery.
And the three girls who stay standing won't reveal who's the one who gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who was going to win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday's final
All three women lyrically praised why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who gets Wood's final flower?," their answers could act as a spoiler for who gets the Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to name Mackay as the one best suited to Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been sharing an easy relationship since a certain day.
"From the moment I entered the house and watched Sarah and Sam's energy, I felt they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course," says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah's a really earthy woman, she's a lot of fun," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood could make a great couple.
For her part, she claims that during his last visits home, she realized wood might be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized this wasn't just a game anymore - I opened my heart to him now," she adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if not her, she looked mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say it," she said.
I love both girls equally - it's a tie between Snezena and Lana.
Bachalor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 a.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and a lot of teams questioned after his great start to practice late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was done by an Australian Rugby League convert on the first kickoff of a pitch in Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and take him into the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing up the rookies in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also endorsed Hayne publicly at a post-game press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received encouragement from special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the mistake and only worry about the next game.
Even in the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club had hoped for on his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing as he left the field after an error and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he couldn't have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"That happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a record in his own goal area led to a Queensland trio.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested for pointing guns at a Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his yukos oil company confiscated, and his democratic efforts limited.
The ÚS defended the emigrants who were in the interest of compensation of their property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple contacted the state for compensation under the Law on Extrajudicial Rehabilitation.
The court initially owed them the requested amount, i.e. more than CZK 2.8 million, but the court of appeal changed their claim by awarding them only less than CZK 90,000, citing the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the price regulations of 1991.
The emigrants were defended by the Supreme Court and owed them the originally defendant amount.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay out the money, turned to the ÚS.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - although it was then adequate in relation to the property withdrawn - now amounts to only a fraction of the value of the property.
"This cannot be the burden of the interveners as in the restitution of beneficiaries who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who have not been able to claim compensation sooner," explained Judge-Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk, explaining why the ÚS sided with the emigrants.
"The ÚS has repeatedly advocated that ordinary courts should act in restitution matters in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted against the beneficiaries and that the purpose of restitution legislation is always achieved, i.e. the atonement of property injustice caused by acts of the former totalitarian state," the judge added.
Evita will now be played by Radka Fišarová in the musical Studio DVA.
Radka Fišarová, by the way, became the world's youngest Evita when, in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of argentine dictator Eva Perónová in the first Czech production of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Time Rice at the Spiral Theatre in Prague.
To return to the same role, he says, "To this day, the intensity of Eita has not been matched by much performance."
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
She was recommended for the role of First Lady of Argentina by Monika Absolonová.
I've seen Mona three times in Evita, and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Here I suddenly saw a whole new concept.
I am quite a fan of more modern modifications, but this one is simply particularly good.
"The direction of Ondřej Sokol is original, light and contemporary," says Fišarová.
The musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monica Absolone's Birthday Concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. at studio DVA.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
The experience will surely include a joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also step away from the director's desk when he takes over during the filming of Karel Roden's film as President Perón.
Due to public interest, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA theatre in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Directed by Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally directed by Monika Absolonová.
Karel Roden as President Perón and Che Peter Strenáčik appear alongside her.
Legendary songs by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovský are performed by a live orchestra led by Christopher Mark, who participated in the first performance at the Spiral Theatre.
4 people killed after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of demonstrators against the draft new state constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district officer, says more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal says police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under a proposed new constitution and mitigated their political influence.
Other demonstrations in western Nepal have also been recorded by the ethnic group Tharus, which demands the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces — a big step towards a new constitution, but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been going on since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers in Kathmandu voted this week on a provision of the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We certainly can't panic right now.
After losing on the ice of the championship Litvínov, you did not even manage a home duel with the Sparta hockey players (3:5).
Aren't you worried about a similarly disastrous entry into the Premier League as you did a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of Cape Verde's southernmost islands has a 60 percent chance of developing a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilze also has a 60 percent chance of developing a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) said it was launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European states to flee war-torn and poor countries. Google doubles each amount you select.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
The message was posted on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoud based on personal experience as she fled Kabul with her family as a seven-year-old.
"We have travelled on many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, cold and fear," Masoudová said.
I was lucky.
But with europe's worsening immigration crisis, more and more families like mys are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among 4 non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will double all posts made through google.com/refugeerelief page to $5.5 million.
Europe is facing the biggest wave of refugees since World War II. Most come from Syria, which has been torn by a four-year war that has driven 4 million people out this year.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery could be useful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"Mortality data takes a long time to display," says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study of JAMA surgery.
Weight loss operations, bariatric surgery use different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
A BMI that measures the relationship of weight in relation to height is considered normal at values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates an overweight person, and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers from Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan have used data collected from a 2007 study that looks at two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in type 3 diabetes treatments in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI among those who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was solved completely in 36 percent and partly in 28 cases.
In the drug-treated group, only 1 percent and partially only about 2 percent of patients were completely resolved for diabetes comparison.
Furthermore, control of blood pressure, trigylcerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol was shown to be "generally better in the surgical group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood haemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect ongoing blood sugar levels in the body.
Hemoglobin A1c is best maintained below 7 percent, researchers report.
After surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the drug-treated group, this figure remained at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - reflected in better levels of hemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs. 2.1 percent), and were more likely to relapse diabetes (46.9 percent vs. 16.7 percent).
While the new study does not show an improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from studying stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to prolonged life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
While the new study did not show an improvement in survival among post-surgical patients, according to Blackstone, it is a reassuring result for people with bmi under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This is where this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously after a decline in a patient's BMI between the age of 27 and 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to let people know the gravity of the situation," he says.
I think that once they accumulate these genetic changes that firmly link their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really hard.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the ethics study, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that, under the current circumstances, humanity's interest should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in resolving the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Addressing the issues of violence, the Dalai Lama also spoke out about the lawsuits against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the violent reaction of the US has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not a violent journey.
I know his motives were good, but he used force to create unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children ingesting an ambulance in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitation agent, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, the number of ingestions of sanitation in children under 12 reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children get to these products more often, and unfortunately, there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation deliberately, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking sanitation because of cheap fuss.
The teens allegedly mixed sanitation with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive sing-singo tinge of the device.
"Kids don't think it's going to hurt them," Lopez said.
A lot of the more attractive (sanitation products) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitation products with the smell of strawberry, grapefruit or orange, which are very tempting for children.
The sanitation device contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few sip can mean alcohol poisoning.
"This is highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Toxicology Control Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't leave a glass of whiskey lying around either, but people leave these sanitations outside, and when kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested up to four sip of a strawberry-stinking sanitation agent at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold considered adult drunkenness, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency physician who cared for her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered indistinct words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use nonalcoholic products or to ensure that sanitation products are out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation products have been linked to death.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing an ambulance that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials believed the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in up northern New York planned to poison their "evil" teacher by planting antibacterial products around the room," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has banned their presence in the room.
The police assessed the thwarted plan as "innocent cheming," referring to the discipline of the school district,
Rumor: No inconsistencies in Celtic team
Griffiths downplays talk of inconsistency at Celtic, while Deila admits the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he reverses it again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against an attack on Neilson and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty secured Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, giving the Dons a five-point lead over each other and Celtic.
Griffiths denies mismatch
The situation has sparked rumors of inconsistencies at Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his team-mates are not working under any pressure from increased scrutiny in the run-up to the Dutch league match.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer claims Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer any rivalry between them over the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, says: "In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic's matches, and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
The people here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension at Old Firm matches and it is not only the people of Scotland who are watching these games.
I'll turn things around, deila commits.
ROONY Dealia has admitted celtic are stumbling a bit, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
The defeat by Malmo and the subsequent champions league drop were quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says: "Celtic have had bad times and will rise again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about the current events.
We're exactly the same - but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players so much better.
Now it's very important to stick together.
Warburton is concerned about January reinforcements
Despite comments that emerged a few weeks ago suggesting that he had already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about the big buy-out of reinforcements and insists he does not want to disrupt the ibrox team's unity.
The former Brentford boss says: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer transfer window."
The players who come in the summer have the whole preseason to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Celtic Michu transfer target hints at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who was linked with Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted that he could retire after his contract with Swansea expires.
The 20-year-old has been out with a prone ankle problem for two years and has been unable to find a way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will fight the SFA over comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on the defender was later cancelled out - the third red card issued by referee Collum to be cancelled out.
Neilson stands by his statement, yingested: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths committed to avoiding Tynecastle
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014
"It was a derby and it was a heated moment," the striker said, continuing: "I can safely say I will not be coming back to Tynecastle unless it is in a Celtic jersey."
Tannadice council believes in managing Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that dundee United's board still believes in fixing the situation by managing the team at the same time - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for action again," Donnelly promises.
MCInnes happy for 'ugly win' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen team had to hold on desperately against Hamilton Accies to take a seventh consecutive league win and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a first-half penalty from Adam Rooney.
McInnes states: "There is no team that has won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this type of match."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged as uk total unemployment rises
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK rate (5.5 per cent), figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now halting to 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labour market and Scottish employment has risen while unemployment has fallen.
Why I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will watch a man be killed.
If that happens, and I hope that doesn't happen, I'm going to sit in the viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary death chamber and see Richard Glossip executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four officials who would witness his death.
I first received the invitation in January through my best friend and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approaches, I'm starting to worry about it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way for me to tell you the whole death penalty story.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more applications than vacancies, a morbid lottery is carried out to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of press seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the execution unbiasedly.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've formed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that kid.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'm just going to have to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the inmate's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that "she could have formulated it better," but still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell a story on the spot.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
To learn more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've created.
I'm not going to repeat all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would have made him guilty of complicity in a crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I certainly believe that not enough evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And it is from this perspective that I will watch his death.
I can't say I'm going to be really objective.
For this purpose, you can contact other journalists.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing the person I love die an unnecessary death.
Man escapes Canning River after police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after freeing a man from the Canning River.
A Petrh man's bet to escape the police didn't work out after he got into shallow muddy water just metres from a police officer who tried to persuade him to return to shore peacefully.
Canning Vale Police were called to an incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying, "I'm not going out, just come get me,"" Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't exactly want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use a safer tactic, and that was police negotiation."
"Sometimes people try to do funny things when they run away," Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired locals to start planning ben cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the organisers tried to spy on him and threatens to end the races
Peeter Moody accused racing Victoria organisers of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to stop racing immediately.
He took aim at racing Victoria's organisers and integrity department and was based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's late scratching during maintenance on race day, which was the final straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin's positive cobalt swadd, which he can't explain.
He bit his tongue on espionage charges for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dry grapes."
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it all comes out of you at once," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to go upside down and make the owners think I'm doing my best for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'd have to consider what I'm going to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped a bombshell in racing.com that department integrity had tried to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I'm going to name after the question - and they offered him a job in my stables for finding out about the things that were being done in my stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
Of course, they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, everyone should show their information, because they've completely failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of this today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and make sure people outside coaching positions take responsibility for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the people here think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now will give them some thought.
But I got to a point where I don't care anymore, and it's sad.
It really made me sad.
I will press them and put the burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can walk away.
The coach's frustration levels have risen with a long-running investigation into cobalt, including Lidari, and recent scratches have made him feel like he "could put his license on the table for hours."
Mood, best known for preparing undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the treatment rule on race day "ridiculous" after clay or mud was applied to horses' feet, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
Someone on my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it did.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating tiles on the day of the race, for which organizers have already opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Cobram driver who drove off arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and drove off after a collision.
A cyclist has been airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Main Road on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist drove off without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalio confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with failure to stop in an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy criticised his players' tackles as "setting the plan" for two NRL premiership favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the Storm's controversial victory in the sydney qualifying final on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark about Strorm after his team's 1-0 win over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "showcase" for rugby league and, in his view, two Queenslanders were not "too big" to play wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' interventions and said they focused on "contact" during them.
Bellamy added that the situation has boosted his confidence as his team has been criticised by two senior coaches, which may mean they fear defeat from the Storm.
"It keeps coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our defensive system and techniques in the last year, in recent weeks we have only put emphasis on contact during procedures, and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent's been here three years and he's obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which might have come as a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like that always come at this time of year.
Bellamy downplayed Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetov's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the Premiership in 2010 by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He was right that his game on Saturday was as exciting as ours. It was just as exciting," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St George was criticised for being a boring team and Wayne said at the time that he didn't really care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that seems to him to be canceling, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
That's the kind of football you'd want to play if you had this type of player at your disposal.
He said that in 2010 and now wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say things like that because they're afraid of fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think about us when they were getting to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that more goals were scored in the Storm-Roosters game than in the Broncos-Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I wasn't looking, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more tries in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and not scoring tries interesting?
I think they're agendas.
If they mention us, it means we will definitely meet again at this stage.
The Storm are on break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in next Saturday night's preliminary final at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale from the morning of next Tuesday.
Serbian man gets $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled out of Queensland has been granted $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic (29 years old) was one of five men arrested last month by federal police searching for 100 kilograms of the drug from the yacht Solay, which arrived from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting the accused at the port during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse café, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possessing commercially high cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer based his defense on the fact that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could have been in the café entirely by accident and innocence.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan thought Maksimovic would escape.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather jointly offered $200,000 bail for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that the $200,000 deposit is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts were clearly inadequate because the accused did not appear in court further, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report daily to the police and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure paedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, then logged on to her online chat, where he had a bunch of indecent photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up to find her phone missing and then found hogg asleep in her hand.
She went through it and found disturbing news before alerting her mother.
Police got involved and saw five photographs, then analysis computers found the address and discovered "disturbing" searches on the site using terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then told officers that his reason was to "guide pedophiles" online before "pretending to be a police officer and scaring them."
Fiscal representative Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer search, but claims he just wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he was doing it to lure them in.
He claims he got drunk and said he wanted to see pictures of rapes and murders.
Mrs Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, he called his mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw indecent images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was questioned and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to receiving or providing inappropriate images of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail conditions on January 25 and not appearing at a court hearing on March 24 this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on the sex offenders' register because he could argue that there was "no fundamental sexual overtone" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael adjourned sentencing until October to file reports of social workers.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was remanded in custody ahead of a hearing on other unsolved cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders' list before his sentencing date.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe delivers bad speech in parliament
Earlier this year, Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell on the steps leading to the podium.
He wasn't hurt, but video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by claims by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats that warned them against booing Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, he was booed and provoked during his State of the Nation address to parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning against mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that will not appear, but is named 'death'," he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned to know that immunity ends in parliament and as soon as they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats against MPs.
Hewlett-Packard is about to cut up to 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the cost of the company's business services.
LATER this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating the pc and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.
The expected job cuts will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will start in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, HP's CEO and chairman of the board, who will lead the unit after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP is today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of businesses to help businesses transition to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will be focused on providing unparalleled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will lay out a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who manufacture electrical equipment and whose Garage in Palo Alto has been dubbed "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP undertranged massively to handle the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the second-largest PC manufacturer and one of america's largest tech firms, is the latest in a sector based on the belief that a niche company is getting better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates need to get behind the injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it is still only September and, if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason for him not to play again at Christmas.
This best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least four more English games and, in terms of history, his involvement in the next European Championship this summer is clearly uncertain.
The great pity of this newest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strongly from an ankle injury and then got back into his former form during the preseason.
"This kind of injury is not a career-threatening one," wenger says.
It's a wound that requires healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he'd sustained before.
This could be purely medically true, as Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
Also here an unpleasant pattern arises.
A survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilshere since he made his game debut six years ago.
Over the past five years, he has played in only 65 Arsenal league games out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, he has been one of two Premier League clubs to have lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in recorded injuries over the past season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and get a competition," wenger says.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure he will, and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb with matches against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger could also start Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and let the players who need it breathe a breather," wenger says.
While Arsenal are the clear favourites to progress from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also unbeaten in a total of 41 matches after retaining their "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by a 3.2-magnitude earthquake on Wednesday night.
That was the 10th time this year in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League, when they capitulated against Monaco, and there remains a remote hope that he will lead the club to their first European Cup victory.
"This commitment is tremendous," wenger says.
It never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar depictions in different shows is glaring, especially given the need for men to open up more desperately than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the single highest cause of death among men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) marked 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies a friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood," their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, the circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance of mental health problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must first be achievable.
In this communication via social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, the immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and more successful has doubled, even though we are rather isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - that have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker recently explained, money doesn't really buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was the source of that idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent sacrifice, the moment of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all stem from the realization that, yes, men can also identify with it, even if they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me, "my role as a listener of people who feel depressed or suicidal has really confirmed to me that even the smallest friendly interactions can make a difference."
Men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with friends.
The old adage "deal with it" is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends are one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer a longer-term compensation mechanism.
It emphasizes small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my assignment, the status of an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater up close, network of friends and family.
So if you're going to Comedy Central's FrendsFest this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned to celebrate.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - the full 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored to help PSG take Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut to help PSG beat Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmou at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored the goal less than four minutes after his Champions League debut and psg sent the French champions to victory, but then they threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, which is why Team Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are focused not only on qualifying for the knockout rounds, but on improving their path to the quarter-finals, which they have recorded in each of the previous three seasons.
But even though they scored three points, it was not a classic performance by Laurent Blanc's team and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was prodigal in front of goal and was later replaced against his home team and the club where he began his illulinible career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so a 2-0 win is a problem for our opponents and looking comfortable in defence is a good start, although there are things we'll have to improve on as the season progresses," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, yet I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of three changes to the PSG team that suffered a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in League One this weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was identified as the man who will take PSG to a new level in Europe after last month's transfer from Manchester United and showed why when he ran onto Marco Verratti's pass behind malmo's defence and sent the ball behind Johan Wiland's back into the far corner of the net with a beautiful finish.
However, if anyone expected it to kick-start PSG's spectacular victory, they must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage, started with nine internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders and two overcast midfielders were tough opponents.
But apart from Nikola Djurdjice's shot, which narrowly missed kevin trapp's far corner in the 34th minute, there was little to offer in attack.
Instead, PSG took advantage of the attack with poor passes and a poor finish that was not good even from Ibrahimovic, who failed to fire five times in the first half and was then disappointed as his shot reached the net shortly after the start of the second half by Cavani.
However, he proved far more appropriate when it came to preparing chances for his team-mates and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a shot that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan sending his sixth goal of the season over the line after Ibrahimovic had passed to him after a pass from maxwell's left wing.
This put an end to Malmo's thoughts about the possibility that they could make a big deal out of the match, and only a superb save from Wiland from close range thwarted David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even when the goal from substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was disre teded at the end of the match.
Malmo coach Age Hareide admitted psg were one class above his team, with the Norwegian saying: "Our last Game in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a fascinating match for them.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in share sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, hit by a collapse in commodity prices, made $2.5 billion from the share sale on Wednesday as part of its massive debt reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is grappling with a resupply of commodity prices as China's slowdown in the economy reduces demand and sparks of doom across markets.
Rights issues sent Glencore's share price to a peak on the London stock market in early morning trading on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the $2.5 billion share sale is part of broader plans to reduce its $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares at 123 pence a share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
They disposed of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent for the group.
Concerns about prolonging China's growth have cut the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities have plummeted by 20 to 40 percent.
White House confirms Washington visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the US at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner after the talks.
"President Xi's visit represents an opportunity to strengthen us-China relations and encourages cooperation in solving problems in the field of international, regional and common interests, and is an opportunity for constructive discussion of the differences between the two countries," the report adds.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several US tech leaders on his way to Washington before continuing to New York for the UN meeting in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyber-abuses and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis has swept the Schengen area.
The emergency flare detonated by Germany is far from a european crew, but it is already forcing the ship to change course, french daily Le Figaro reported.
On Monday, the European Union decided to tackle the refugee problem first: it will systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as they set foot on the old continent - especially in Greece - rather than arguing over the future distribution of refugees by quota based on a quantity that is increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, member states' interior ministers changed their priority.
Rather than worrying about the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those arriving today and resolve the fate of those already within the Schengen area.
"Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential for managing migration," the text discussed by ministers in Brussels on Monday stresses.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU finds that it is under threat in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not wasting its resolve and increasing pressure.
It is restoring border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of asylum seekers in that country.
In doing so, the Central Power makes it clear that without it, no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday has already served as evidence.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, although with varying intensity.
Hungary did this a long time ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under Schengen rules.
He sees it as a domino effect, but he also sees the blind.
The key issue for Berlin and Paris now is the effective introduction of mandatory entry controls in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already passed inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is realized stiffly.
According to unofficial statistics, two-thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that camps will remain on its shoulders where refugees would accumulate at its expense.
Greece remains the real black hole.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands near the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are genuine asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge gaping hole.
Athens, which is still in financial turmoil and awaiting a new government, has put its hands in its lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan route and a source of now common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises that checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but has not set a number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe," EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
It is therefore about deploying intervention teams from the European border control agency Frontex in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its capacity to receive asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
"Adequate financial resources will be needed," warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From the point of view of the law, Athens will continue to have the final say.
The issue of the emergence of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is getting close to it.
In any other way, the 28-year-old's new emergency has pushed back the issue of binding quotas and the 160,000 refugees raised earlier this year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament, strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was maintained on Monday in a text approved by a majority of 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise involves the reallocation of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed in June during a hectic EU summit, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead in an avalanche in the Alps, of which three are said to be Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, german nationality is also a woman who is the only one of the affected group of eight to survive.
Previous media reports have stated that she is Polish.
A woman in her 30s was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury in the femur area.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly in their 40s.
"The rescue operation is over, and the bodies of the victims have also been taken to Briancon for identification," said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident happened around noon in the pelvoux mountain area below the top of the 4015-metre Dôme de Neige des Ecrins.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high," said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, a huge amount of snow was pouring into the eight-member group at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
The weather service did not warn of bad weather in the area today.
Trpišovský before the match with Braga: Finally, the real Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovský, in his cup debut, managed to get through the Europa League preliminary rounds with liberec footballers to the basic group and now he is looking forward to enjoying the right Europe with the team.
The Slav welcomes the 2011 finalist Braga at the beginning of the main stage of the competition and, according to the coach, wants to impose his playing style on her.
After all the nerves in the knockout fights, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we're there and we're going to play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal scored, we can play our tactics and we are not bound by just a double match.
"I am very much looking forward to it and it is a real Europe, before that it was just a qualification," Trpišovský said at a press conference.
He considers Braga to be the top team.
He will be very active, they have all Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good on the ball.
The opponent may be more difficult because he doesn't have that name, but he has a player in his cadre who, I suspect, has scored three goals for Manchester.
"It's an excellent team at the level of the top teams," Trpišovský said.
But he does not consider Braga to be the clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong in our stadium, and we want to confirm that," said the coach, whose team lost only the opening Super Cup in Pilsen from 11 matches this season.
He believes that Liberec can impose his style on Braz.
We have a team that will be strong on the ball, at the same time uncharacteristically disciplined for them.
They play from a 4-4-2 formation with a quick transition to the attacking phase.
"He is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the field," Trpišovský said.
In the preliminés we studied our opponents a lot, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, which we also adapted the trainings to.
"And we definitely want, even if it's going to be very challenging, to play to our notes," the coach added.
Student films take over Písek, the international festival begins.
More than 350 authors from 51 countries entered their works this year in the competition of the 15th international festival of student films in Písek.
Four dozen of them, which were sent to the finals by a committee of students and educators, will be screened from 15 to 18 October at the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said jakub Charvát, a spokesman for the festival.
Every year, the festival has its own special theme, which depends on the festival theme.
It's a detective story this year.
Richard Blumenfeld, the director of this year's festive evenings, plans to combine elements of television, film and theatre production.
"And, of course, we must also solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year," Charvát said.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student's work - films played, animated and documentary.
They will be judged by an international jury, including last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the festival organizers prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbo-chanson band Let's Fly?, playful band Z grains or petra hapková with the recital Life at the Bar will be coming.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first will be brought by a graduate of the Písek Film School and a winner of prestigious awards, among them the one from World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrennerová.
The second exhibition will describe the atmosphere that reigned in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
The cameraman and documentarist Martin Čech will come to the discussion with visitors, the mute film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the Písek natives Brukner, Novotný and Hlach will baptization their new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we will also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron saint of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences with each other and develop common ties and film crafts," the spokesman said.
The Pitching forum, where students can meet film professionals, complete several job auditions at once and gain a job position, will certainly help to do this.
The festival is connected with the establishment of the Private Technical School of Film in Písek.
Its founders, husband and wife Vladana and Miloň Terč, organized the first year in 1997.
It was held once every two years until the sixth year.
In the event of the bankruptcy of the CK, insurance companies are to pay the claims of clients in full.
Insurance companies should pay clients' claims in full in the event of the travel agency's bankruptcy.
This was decided by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday when it approved a revised amendment to the Act on The Conditions of Business in Tourism.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee, according to a draft that heads to the Senate for consideration.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay clients' claims even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the adjustment, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end insurance for travel agencies against bankruptcy if the amendment adm.
However, travel agencies also criticise the proposal.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for YES) pointed out that cases where insurance companies have not paid full compensation are not Eurocommusic.
She drew attention to this year's decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive sufficient information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the right limit, Stressed Šlechtová.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have a limit to be feasible," said Miroslav Kalousek, Vice-President of TOP 09.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work because no one will give it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to cease their activities or move abroad," Kalousek warned.
Tomio Okamura (SPD), a member of the Presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies, disagreed with Kalousek's concerns based on a survey of member CK members.
"Stop lobbying insurance companies," he said.
The comments of the insurance undertakings are not considered relevant by Okamura, there is no official written statement there to that effect.
But they are looking into whether travel agencies will be deductibles, which Okamura says is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the rival Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about deleting stairs for Czech travel agencies, also warned against the provision.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to take out insurance.
"Consumer protection works," Fischer says.
Her proposal to delete the disputed passage was not approved by the House.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) also did not agree with the proposal to return the draft to the committee due to an alleged violation of the Civil Code.
Filip pointed to travel agencies that he said could put consumers at risk.
In view of the constitutional court's verdict, the rapporteur of the draft, Martina Berdychová,withdrew her proposal, which would have limited the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not have known that the indemnity would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not originally include a minimum of four million insurance limits for travel agencies that offer air travel tours and a million-dollar limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The threshold will remain at 30 percent of planned sales revenue for tours.
However, the indemnity limit will have to be such that, in the event of the travel agency's bankruptcy, it covers all customer claims.
Even after the modifications, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to state newly for the tours sold which travel agency organises the trip.
Travel agencies will have to submit information on the economy and number of trips to insurance companies before concluding the contract.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also provides for further regular information to insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of tours sold and the amount of advances and sales for and for travel vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of the legal obligations towards the insurance undertaking, it will, according to the draft, call on it to remedy it or may prohibit it from contracting in the event that the breach of the obligation could endanger the interests of customers.
The amendment is also intended to re-regulate the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which it will submit every year until the end of April for the following year.
The request will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial expenditure plan and a outlook for the next two years.
According to the association, however, the petitioner did not think about the situation of what would happen if the insurance company terminated the CK contract.
It will not be able to hold tours and clients who purchased the trip before the insurance was withered will lose it, according to the association.
In this case, CK will suffer a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good shape.
One way travel agencies can cope with such a situation will be to apply to the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and take advantage of much softer conditions abroad, and in our market we will only act as agencies, said Jan Papež, Vice-President of the Association.
According to him, the draft amendment also contains the institute of bank guarantees, but so unthinking that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since the bank guarantee cannot sound to an unbounded amount.
Moreover, according to the association, a change in the current practice is de facto unnecessary.
Within two years, the whole law will have to be revised again in the light of the new EU directive.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies now operate on the Czech market.
This year, only three CK's ceased their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion a year.
Merkel: We must improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with German provincial prime ministers.
At the same time, it again appealed for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 member countries.
We need to do more to help the countries from which refugees leave or where they stay after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will promote decent conditions in refugee camps, such as Jordan and Lebanon, the German Chancellor said, according to which such a signal could also be increased financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The Länder also encourage the German Government to promote a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis to European countries," Merkel said.
In this context, The Regional Prime Minister of Brandenburg, Dietmar Woidke, said at a press conference that he expected real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czech Republic, among others.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke out in favour of speeding up asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start integrating foreigners more quickly, said the Prime Minister of Brandenburg.
According to him, most of the money that Germany spends on caring for refugees must also be used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
It will take more teachers for the refugees to master German.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if we can integrate the refugees, they can be an asset to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a diversity discussion, claiming it wasn't necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday's episode of HBO's Greenlight, the actor cast in the Brown series interrupted, emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives about the black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie and not casting a show," Damon says.
Shocked, Brown reacted angrily with disbelief and sighed "Hoo! Wow. Okay," when the comments about the Martian went live.
Damon and Brown teamed up with well-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to treat harmony's character," Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character who's a hooker who's being hit on by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People championed finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that directing them "might end up giving us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disassade with Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at writing the clip, "Matt Damon jumped into the speech of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet has received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the 2014 killing of teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national effect, pressuring lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made allusions to the movement while presenting nominees in the Album of the Year category at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums are still important," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The most recently leader of the Black Lives Matter movement presented a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the executives said.
Damon was recently reported to a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the west.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
"American Ninja Warrior has its first winner"
Professional mountaineer and busp isaac caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, taking home $1 million.
In the competition, which has just finished its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all obstacles on the track.
During this season's finale, two men made it to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb on a rope more than 220 m long.
Britten was the first to climb within the set limit, becoming the first contestant to overcome a debilitating 4 sections in American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero outperformed him by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview to news.... News right after his hard-earned victory, and you could tell he was still in shock at winning the $1 million grand prize.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life," Isaac told E! in response to your win.
"So all of a sudden... I can't imagine what it's going to be like now."
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the run of the finale and why Britten won't get any reward, despite the fact that he became the first contestant to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the person who finishes the track fastest.
"If more than one competitor participates in the track, the best time will win," Weed said.
Even if winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
"I don't think he has a grudge.
He's glad he's accomplished what he's done.
He received a warm reception from the fans.
He's a great guy, and he likes his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife."
Geoff told me, "If there was going to be anyone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac."
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue its eighth season, which will begin shooting in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers pass just past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the park.
The Tigers, one of baseball's best teams, are currently in last place in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers narrowly averted their defeat by beating Minessota 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday night.
The Twins squandered a chance to get close to the Houston Astros and seize their second wild card in the American League.
Even if only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the Z-word that was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun, no matter how," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive start, and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings before taking the next in the sixth and ninth innings.
Simon (13-9) allowed 6 1/3 innings and 3 runs.
It was only his third good game in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year with convincing results," Simon said.
"It's hard to put yourself in a game when you're on the bench a lot and that's why I want to get into the game."
Tigers batter Victor Martinez hit three hits and made two hits and his first pulled point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point game since the last game in June, in which he hit four times against the Seattle Mariners.
"He put his back into it," said Ausmus.
"He looked good in practice, batted noticeably better and managed to carry it into the match."
With three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had the best chance of getting back in the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton pitched the inning with two outs on the left side of the field.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks scored on a set-up, and Simon pulled Brian Dozier out before left-hander Blaine Hardy traded him.
Hardy struck out his only opponent, Mauer, and had batter Miguel San in front of him, who hit the ball and ran two bases, leaving right-hander Drew VerHagen behind.
With two bases loaded and a tiebreaker in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send a third baseman over two bases.
Plouffe has already made 27 runs over two bases this season and dominates the league table.
Detroit held on for a ninth inning, Mauer got two shut-downs and Bruce Rondon made it 5-4 for the Tigers.
However, the right-hander struck out San for three pitches.
Detroit took advantage and scored on Phil Hughes' play.
The Tigers got three runes in the first two innings against the retired right-hander, who entered the game after a more than month-long break due to back muscle inflammation.
"I certainly didn't imagine such a start," Hughes said, "but by the third inning, I felt like I was pitching better."
After resisting the onslaught in the first inning, Hughes dropped one run to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Two outs for right fielder J.D. Martinez earned Victor Martinez, who was the first to run all the bases.
Victor Martinez broke his streak 0-21.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a point to right field and scored on another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown over as he tried to run to third base.
The Tigers added in the second inning when pitcher James McCann and outsman Anthony Gose scored two and, by turn, one run to make it 3-0.
"That got us to our knees," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
"He didn't hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place."
Hughes, who won on a number of pitches, ended the third inning scoreless and was replaced by right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes hit three bases, got six hits and four strikes.
NOTES: Anibal Sanchez, the Tigers' right-hand pitcher, ended the game with sorething in his right shoulder.
He will be taken care of by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list because of strained shoulder muscles since mid-August, is expected to start Wednesday's game.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-hander Daniel Norris, who will return from injury to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 after four games since Being traded to left-hander David Price on June 30.
Since August 20, however, he has not played due to a teated muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third game together at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will face Minnesota left-hander Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up economy to wider world
It is necessary to open up the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group tasked with reforming governance on Tuesday.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies," the central head of the group for deepening overall reform said at the 16th meeting.
Promoting opening up in nascent reforms will give new impetus and vitality, as well as new room for economic growth, Xi says.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the relaxation of border control policy, support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration resident system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and businesses that are outside the investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through testing programs.
The move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers it delegates to firms and make sure that companies themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will allow border areas to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be open to private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies that are financed from abroad and will provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a "green card," by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
New inpatient wards may be created in the Karlovy Vary Region.
According to the Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region Jakub Wowk (ČSSD), the current capacity of the inpatient departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of individual hospitals.
However, there are also possibilities of expanding care in the region.
For example, in surgical departments, one-day surgical centers could be established, where, according to the set concept, surgical procedures that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
It is not yet clear which specific hospitals should be focused on one-day surgery.
In turn, a laser center with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases could be created at the skin department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital.
The concept also recommended the creation of an atpalic center to care for patients with brain disabilities who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be set up centrally and should be an integral part of the anaesthesiology-resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another inpatient capacity that seems insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region are after-care beds, especially beds of the Long-Term Sick Treatment Center (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdk is insufficient and, above all, should be closely linked to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should function as rehabilitation beds and part as classic LDN beds, the concept recommends.
As he points out, after-care beds are mainly missing in the Karlovy Vary Hospital.
There you could use the buildings left after centralization.
Last but not least, social health beds with a focus on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are absent in the Karlovy Vary Region.
These beds are in short supply throughout the country, so they could also serve as an Alzheimer's centre for other regions.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called follow-up beds, for which European subsidies will be released.
"These are beds that will follow the fields of supespecialized care and will form a space for the translation of patients after surgery, for example, after cardiothoracic, neurosurgical, transplant or other procedures," describes the regional concept of inpatient care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
