Inflation in Europe jumped over food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November price growth in 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 percent in October, annual inflation was 3.1 percent, reported the Luxembourg statistical office of the Union.
The official forecast predicted only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not cut the key interest rate, saying that a reduction, together with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below two percent, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must &quot;discourage&quot; inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation of 3.3 percent is a 15-year record; in Spain it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has skyrocketed due to soaring food and energy prices.
The futures prices of wheat rose by 88 percent, and the soybean rate also reached its highest value since 1973.
Likewise, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets has risen 52 percent this year, and last month a barrel of black gold cost nearly $ 100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent in 2008 to 2.5, but will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will remain at around 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees the government crisis
The circle of Fidesz supporters has grown significantly after prolonged stagnation in early December, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured such low support at 13 percent.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would be more than two-thirds (71 percent) support compared to one-fifth MSZP support.
According to the survey, the MDF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, there are one percent more supporters of both camps.
Public opinion on the economy has worsened due to the previous low - the ratio of those who consider the country&#39;s economic situation to be very bad has never been so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their material situation after the more promising spring and summer prospects.
As for next year, most of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth expect improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, the most Gallup Institute poll to date, said the prime minister was doing his job poorly rather than well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is trusted or very trusted by 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orbán&#39;s share of supporters is 38 percent.
54 percent do not trust the prime minister at all, 27 percent do not trust the chairman of the Fidesz movement.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without changing the government.
While after last October&#39;s riots, 35 percent was considered desirable by the government and the prime minister, it is now only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing only a new election.
It is characteristic of the interest in the referendum that 60 percent of the respondents answered the question regarding their possible participation, that a referendum would definitely come, and another 20 percent said that it would probably come.
By comparison, &quot;this Sunday&#39;s parliamentary elections&quot; would certainly be attended by only 55 percent, and another 15 percent considered their turnout likely. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable based on current intentions.
Tuition fees would be no 74, doctor&#39;s fees 79 and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only in the circle of people certainly promising their participation, then the introduction of tuition fees, doctor&#39;s fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has risen in price by almost a fifth
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs business triangle maintained last year&#39;s average price level increase of 16%, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
An article by Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs business triangle has risen by an average of 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets the price reflected an increase of well over a thousand forints.
As food supermarket prices &quot;skyrocketed&quot; last December, the percentage did not show such a drastic increase in percentage terms due to the previously high base.
However, it is certainly unhappy for consumers that what they could easily buy last year for under nine thousand forints, they will not buy for ten thousand now.
The consumer basket of the Daily Economy in the examined hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost HUF 6,800.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year&#39;s level, but the cruel breasts, nuts and also poppies became very expensive.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found kilograms of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca Cola in a returnable bottle was below 200 forints, so even with a deposit, the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, this year, according to the consumer basket of the Napi Gazdaság newspaper, Auchan appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora appeared to be the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices in the consumer basket of the daily Napi Gazdaság increased Cora by 15 percent compared to the prices last Christmas, while Tesco and Auchan increased by approximately 18 percent.
When comparing last year&#39;s highest and this year&#39;s lowest values of the consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year&#39;s lowest and this year&#39;s highest is 21 percent.
In forints, the increase averaged 1,480.
The average price increase last year amounted to HUF 1,206, with prices being affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted trade, and department stores were clearly unable to decide how large a price range to set for individual products, as they could not predict the effect of a change in prices on consumption.
(If a trader plans the circulation rate of a given product incorrectly, he may lose a significant profit due to a price range adapted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket last year was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the price difference for the cheapest was 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference did not manifest itself, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest increased by 1,284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic rise in prices was revealed; in less than 20 months, daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rose by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, does not absolutely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured a price increase of more than 30 percent in 12 months over several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the Daily Economy consumer basket, this seems almost impossible, or the price level of the product, which was quite expensive last year, showed barely above 10 percent price growth, even in the worst case.
Flour suppliers appear to have a stronger position than egg suppliers, and a drastic increase in prices has succeeded in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the business golden triangle do not complain, they still report on a good year.
In our experience, most customers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything, they take durable food on salary.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets had long queues at the box office, or the number of visitors rose sharply.
However, as we know, turnover is lower in rural areas, with several international chains complaining to research companies that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in durable consumer goods.
In many places it is saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection were registered in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding, overloading of staff do not help stop diseases, says the head of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, it also saves on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John&#39;s Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who got to the hospital after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but soon had to return with an MRSA infection, and one important operation could not yet be performed due to the bacteria in his body.
By December 10 this year, 1,094 nosocomial infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens had been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröczová, head of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been confidently registered in hospitals, the others are unknown.
Almost two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant golden staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by a third of people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (eg throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, early infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are given excessively or inappropriately, a bacterium that responds well to antibiotics will develop a bacterium that is very resistant to antibiotics and that spreads rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
Especially in case of temporary or permanent dysfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight or in patients over the years, it can cause serious nosocomial infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St. John&#39;s Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are part of daily practice in hospitals.
&quot;Infection should not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not only there,&quot; said Tibor Nyulasi, &quot;where the presence of the pathogen is not studied.&quot;
Resistant to antibiotics
&quot;We isolate these patients, the nursing staff treats them in rubber gloves and a mask, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them,&quot; said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to hospital are first examined to see if MRSA is present in their body, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in vogue
The vast majority of nosocomial infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favorable for the prevention of the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröczová.
As the infection is common in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor admitted patients and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
The fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance these examinations also plays a role in this.
Most cases are revealed if the patient suffers from a noticeable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, medical records.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, ie that microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent the development of drug resistance, but hospitals do not follow this in all cases either.
Sampling of microbiological samples is even rarer in the basic or outpatient treatment of patients, said Karolina Böröczová.
It saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most commonly spread among patients through healthcare professionals.
That is why hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in home hospital conditions.
On the contrary, the rooms are often overcrowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
As Karolina Böröczová pointed out, unfortunately we can also find that in hospitals that are in an unfavorable material situation, they save on disinfectants, there are few nurses and a lot of patients, which further increases the chances of infections.
According to Karolina Böröczová, where the necessary protective measures are observed, there are demonstrably fewer similar infections or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has written a program to prevent MRSA or reduce its incidence.
The program appears to be successful, with published data showing a declining trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is one of the priorities for preventing the development of multidrug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and nosocomial infections caused by these pathogens.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk
Official expert opinion in the case of the police captain XXII. the circuit that caused the fatal accident is complete.
It can be ruled out that Police Captain XXII. Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the capital&#39;s prosecutor&#39;s office, said the district, which killed pedestrians on Tuesday and who had resigned in the meantime, under the influence of alcohol or drugs, said Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the capital&#39;s prosecutor&#39;s office, on Friday.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which had already stated that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then director of the police directorate XXII. district crashed on Tuesday in Lajos Kossuth Street in XXII. circumference by his own car when turning a fifty-five-year-old man who entered in front of him when crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian crossed the zebra is not an attenuating circumstance according to the rules of the road, the turning car must still give way.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned and asked for his retirement, according to the police, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with prosecutors investigating the investigation from the beginning.
Another € 400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit lines totaling € 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects implemented with the support of the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement for EUR 100 million, now signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement worth EUR 150 million is also used to finance education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary for this purpose, the remaining EUR 150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the field of innovation, the parties signed a contract for EUR 50 million, which the budget will use mainly for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The meeting also discussed the 4th metro line.
The parties have agreed that, after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the metro financing, it will return to whether and how the original agreement needs to be modified.
According to János Veres, this may happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary with EUR 8.4 billion.
Interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment fee is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real estate paradise for the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is shopping in the still cheapest, but fast-rising EU market so far?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re / Max.
Bulgaria is without a doubt the most sought-after Eastern European property purchase destination with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
Most of the mountains in the area are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoša, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Beach, the ancient towns of Sozobol and Nessebar, but more and more people are also looking for real estate around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re / Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse investors&#39; interest, and more and more people are also buying in the vicinity of the clearly cheap city of Ruse.
The capital Sofia is also a promise of attractive opportunities, commercial and office space promises the highest return.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of Europe&#39;s most attractive golf paradises, becoming a sought-after destination in the next two seasons in addition to the summer and winter seasons.
Foresighted investors are already buying in bulk, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyles at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but buyers also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly also from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian customers by the Black Sea and in ski paradises.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgiy Jankov, regional director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
Settling people buy either renovated real estate worth 50-100 thousand euros, or dilapidated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, the proximity of the big city, shops and usually the local doctor is important to them.
The second category is cottage buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of an increase in value in the medium or long term.
The rise in price of real estate in the capital is continuous, or demand is growing stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but has grown by 21 percent a year for the past five years.
Rising real estate prices significantly exceed wage growth.
Fodor and Hungarian six percent
According to the information of the Minister of the Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, the meetings of experts will end on Tuesday and after Wednesday&#39;s official opening, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue with a meeting of ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Roadmap, which addresses efforts following the period of emission reductions defined by the Kyoto Protocol valid until 2012.
At the moment, there is a heated debate about them between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also said it does not want to negotiate exact figures now, although it is in favor of an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another big question of the conference is whether, in addition to reducing emissions, developed countries will also provide both material and technological assistance to countries that depend on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member governing board, probably within the framework of the World Environmental Protection Program (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the magazine Piac és Profit.
Hungarian six percent
The Minister of the Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU&#39;s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help bring about a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the success of the &quot;post-2012 agreement&quot;, and is ready to commit to a reduction of up to 30 percent if others developed regions of the world, respectively developed countries are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments commensurate with their capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set a reduction target of 5.2 percent, with the then 15 EU member states committing to 8 percent.
Hungary is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfill. - recalled in a press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a lot going on in Bali, or an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be postponed until 2012. In that case, the reduction commitments set by the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new one. an emission reduction system, the necessity of which was also pointed out in its latest report by the UN International Climate Change Scientific Panel (IPCC), which is the Nobel Peace Prize winner.
This would delay emission reductions and inevitably increase the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
British troops publish recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing server to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) liked YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban here since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken with a miniature camera attached to a helmet, are checked by the Air Force Command, which manages combat operations in the Kandahar area, and then sent on to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable
In this way, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have already reached the Internet, and more than 75,000 people have already watched their &quot;channel&quot;.
The UK Department of Defense registered as a &quot;defense headquarters&quot; in the spring of 2007 and publishes recordings of events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the UK Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Force in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force has published videos according to its original purpose for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good at acquainting the general public with the real purpose of the army&#39;s presence abroad.
&quot;Advertising in this form costs almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment commercials,&quot; Defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, &quot;but it also necessarily carries a political message or confirms in a special way the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government.&quot;
The Americans made the game
The army is worried that in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also released on the server, capturing, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in some hypocritical, &quot;official&quot; promotional films, officers talk about losses at best.
After all, many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during a sharp deployment, have already appeared on the Internet, but the British army has only come across them now.
Americans recruit a little differently - using a shooting game called America&#39;s Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
There will be Christmas with a raffle and pagáky in the ministries
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth is probably not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to 2007 with a sip of coffee and coffee.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, in others officials will conjure a Christmas atmosphere with a raffle and a toast.
A party, a Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a buffet - that&#39;s how the powerful have fun.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most costly ministerial Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defense this year, but it is not expecting its employees.
At Christmas orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive presents, during Mission Christmas they will entertain family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort devotes 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are kicking off other hooves.
The GKM party is held in the center of Jövő Háza, for a total of HUF 4,320,000 and approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected from six hundred employees of the ministry.
The resort will stick to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and a raffle will also be drawn.
The NFÜ Christmas cost HUF 4,700,000 and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Judicial Council (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the agenda.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to another Christmas celebration: this will be organized by the company holding the tenders, the Hungarian Center for Economic Development (MAG) with EU money.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház.
MAG as did not confirm this information, as we were unable to reach the person in question.
No suit needed
The OIT building hosted not only the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which instead of Christmas organized a ball of St. Lucy.
However, the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party began with a greeting minister, after dinner it was possible to dance to live music.
According to the answer to the question of the [origo] portal, evening dresses and suits were not mandatory at all at the ball.
The Puritan party is being prepared by the ministries of health, labor and local governments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Labor Minister Mónika Lamperth does not even officially invite her collaborators to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are counted, who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and pagaks, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Minister for Local Authorities Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply have a drink in the auditorium of the Ministry of Local Authorities and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, at which 436 employees are expected, in its own large hall.
He spends 2,500 forints per guest at the Christmas party - the total amount includes a reception with a buffet and a toast.
Since becoming Minister of János Veres, PM staff have been celebrating Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, the officiality is enhanced not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time.
The Agriculture Resort is holding a New Year&#39;s reception on January 20, and ministerial Christmas is not taking place.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyadvár Castle in Městské sady and, according to the ministry, 1,000 forints per person is intended for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief greeting from the Minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told the [origo] portal.
They were unable to announce the price of the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry of the Environment in the press department.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
He is about to strike a giant strike
The Association of Trade Unions Liga and the National Union of Workers&#39; Councils (MOSZ) will set up their strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday&#39;s unlimited strike.
A public protest rally will take place on Saturday, and work will be stopped on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law.
The event will certainly cause serious disruptions, as rail transport will come to an almost complete halt and the staff of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike within 1 pm.
On Friday afternoon, the Liga Association, together with the National Union of Workers&#39; Councils, will present the details of the jointly organized Monday strike.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike commission will also be set up to coordinate Monday&#39;s event.
A public protest rally is being held on Saturday, and from Monday the unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
Should Parliament not finally pass the law on health insurance, the unions will immediately call off the strike.
However, if the legislation is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide what to do next.
According to Monday&#39;s agenda of the Parliament&#39;s meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will not be voted on until late in the evening or at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, serious disruptions can be expected: work on the railways will be suspended indefinitely, part of Budapest&#39;s public transport and more than half of Volán&#39;s companies may be stopped in the morning.
At the same time, half of the carriageway will be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organizations have joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League&#39;s website.
Some organizations have announced an indefinite strike, others have declared a temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) had not been able to agree on sufficient services, while more and more people were traveling by rail at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, a strike will be made at BKV from the beginning of operation until 1 pm, from 7 am to 9 am at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the LIGA Energy Industry Workers&#39; Union. teachers and the Democratic Union of Teachers.
The Hungarian Medical Association will strike alternately throughout the country, and the Democratic Trade Union of Healthcare and Social Workers (EDDSZ), part of the Cooperative Trade Union Forum (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions, valid from next year, be introduced gradually.
The third is to ensure that early retirement for the relevant occupations can be included in the scheme before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ), belonging to the trade union Liga, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning railway branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the country&#39;s risk
According to the Risk Analyzing Division of the Political Capital Institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, have increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The company&#39;s &quot;risk warning&quot; states: in connection with the Hungarian Guard&#39;s activities, the greatest political risk is that &quot;by exacerbating the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma population in Hungary, violent ethnic clashes may occur in a short time&quot;.
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at provoking such an action - adds the research institute.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political leaders: &quot;Public debate on the Roma issue was left to public representatives by representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict.&quot;
This deepens the problem, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - according to the institute.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media, &quot;significantly damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of belief in the country&#39;s stability and democratic development.&quot;
The institute recalls: as part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which has received increasing publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, several organizations have emerged in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which themselves call themselves &quot;national militia associations&quot;.
&quot;A common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civic associations, while openly declaring - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defense tasks (in case of natural disasters, attacks on the homeland, disorder), in addition to the incompetence of police, army , or the state, &quot;he adds.
He further notes: all this is happening in a way that seeks to wrap all sorts of political efforts based on society&#39;s resistance to politics and the parties into a civilian robe.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association in the case of these groups therefore not only serves to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a risk-increasing factor also in terms of neighborly relations.
&quot;In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger. Ultranationalist political leaders of some neighboring countries want to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can affect the political stability of the area, &quot;he adds.
According to the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
According to him, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the establishment of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roma riots that broke out in one of Sofia&#39;s districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used this to establish a guard, with the goal of the organization being the &quot;national militia&quot;.
According to her, &quot;Gypsy terror&quot; has occurred in Bulgaria for the past 17 years, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, recalls the Institute of Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative provoked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
He further writes that the increased risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will form their own guard as a sign of resistance.
As the current activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is possible that Hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way by establishing their own militia, we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
Asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director of the Political Capital Institute, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they publish a risk analysis every year, and if they find something that could affect the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, days off are precisely set by law, and it has become common practice for working days to move around the holidays, which awaits us less times next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the European Union or in America.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
Public holidays are usually linked to church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year with us: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are holidays - for the New Year, so that people can relax after New Year&#39;s Eve.
During the year, we otherwise have a total of eleven holidays.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the revolution of 1848 and October 23, the memorial day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1, work, on November 1 and 2, we remember deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, the two-day holidays are Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Because our state, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on weekends, it has become a practice to move a workday in cases where we only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that the previous Saturdays we stay at work and at school.
For many years, the Minister of Labor has been regulating when the day immediately preceding or following the holiday is worked out in a special decree.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and the employees they employ, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, with regard to their purpose, operate even on non-working days.
This year, the work schedule will change only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, or according to previous experience, most people will &quot;work&quot; the days between Christmas and New Year&#39;s Eve or use the saved holidays.
Next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer transfers of the working day than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around Labor Day, so that workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that Friday, on the contrary, can be a day of rest.
Another move is related to the holiday of October 23: work will take place on Saturday, October 18 instead of Friday the 24th.
However, the end of the year next year will be able to take place entirely in the sign of the holidays, because from December 24 they will have non-stop holidays almost everywhere, even though New Year&#39;s Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six frightening little things you can use to upset your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we almost never notice: all of this &quot;diversifies&quot; the weekdays in the workplace.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or put on gloves, and you will deliberately avoid obscure situations that may upset others.
Tips.
&quot;Sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department,&quot; a colleague tells you.
That you missed the meeting because of that?
At best, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot to forward the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the matter is resolved with one apology.
Before embarrassing an apology, it&#39;s a good idea to think about how you can prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues and consciously try to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There&#39;s nothing more annoying than reaching out for a document, an office supply, or your phone, and they&#39;re not there.
Remember you put a stapler on the table yesterday, but it&#39;s gone by morning?
Or did you find your pen on the desk of a colleague that you considered lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will be rightly angry with you for rummaging through their things.
Don&#39;t take envelopes or sticky notes out of the office, as they can be annoying if you run out of time and need them right away.
Gossip about colleagues&#39; private lives?
There is no good solution to stop the spread of gossip.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Do not hang on everyone&#39;s reports (assumptions) about the private life of colleagues!
When one of them shares his innermost secret with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock down what you have heard, and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence, even if others know about his things.
Are you reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report an absence because of a severe headache because you are not feeling well, or you think you would rather rest today, keep in mind that your work, urgent tasks and work with a deadline are for you. someone else will have to do it.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something may happen that will make you have to stay at home, report it so that your colleagues and managers are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
Grunting, giggling, phoning
Have you immersed yourself in a work from which the giggling of your colleagues will roughly pull you out?
Have you inadvertently witnessed a telephone conversation that would be better off not hearing at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by grunting, singing, loud talking (over their heads), or stomping, constant swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disruptive even when they are not exactly involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for your mistakes?
If something is not on time or you forgot to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Do not refer to the possible chaos prevailing in the office and noisy colleagues!
Acknowledge if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and repair the damage!
Ask how you can put things right, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Sweatpants and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Don&#39;t wear casual clothes, even if your profession allows it!
Don&#39;t be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in casual clothes - and if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When a person wants to satisfy, he ceases to be interesting
Driving in the usual morning traffic jam.
A special melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
I&#39;m adding volume.
The music changes tempo and bass is added to the previous tonal colors, then a female choir joins like a real gem.
A song by Zagar called Wings of Love is played on mr2.
Domestic music life has not really spoiled us with quality electronic pop for a long time.
But suddenly the traffic jam looks quite different, because you&#39;re listening to Zagar&#39;s new album.
The revelation of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions from the domestic digital underground, is slowly changing the picture, and although garage rock is back in vogue with its guitar beating, the home electropop proves to be something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pentecostal and he also played in Yonderboi&#39;s band, until finally - perhaps because two bagpipers do not fit into one chard - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through only when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (eg.
Ferenc Török&#39;s film &quot;Season&quot;).
His formation, initially playing in smaller clubs, met a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first 2002 album among the top 50 home records and declared Zagar at Yonderboie almost the only domestic players who could be marketed. on the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt &quot;on course&quot;, although of course no one asked them if they were happy with the label.
The band reacted as it should: made a new, better album.
The now released album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, may open new avenues for them, although the title itself seeks to build on the initial flights in Pentecost.
This is one verse from a composition by the local old band Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the ethereal, flying would be appropriate, but in addition to the ethereal touch of this music, a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll, has now appeared - in keeping with the spirit, the trend of the time.
In these songs, singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle in the premiere of the album in Millenáris Park, performed.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the mr2 Petőfi station, which has been playing popular music from morning till night, and the sweeping melodies of Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers (&quot;Underground Divas&quot;), began to take hold.
So everything is fine (?).
The hvg.hu portal interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question arises, to what extent does what you play remain marginal music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of fringe music doesn&#39;t mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, say nothing, and can just be created just for sale, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can stem from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is adopted works, regardless of language or state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs .: Light music has a greater tradition abroad, especially from us to the west.
Not only teenagers and people in their twenties go to concerts there, but also older people.
They follow the changes in light music taking place around them much more, because they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who listens to your music, where and how many?
B. Zs .: Of course, it is a good feeling that more and more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a goal, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more at concerts, where mutual influence already works, but this is hidden only in the intangible changes of the moment.
Still, I&#39;ve noticed that when you want to suit an audience, you stop being interesting from then on.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works solo and has built his career more to the west of us.
B. Zs .: We don&#39;t really follow his path, regardless of the fact that they sometimes try to explain our music.
We are more of a team player who relies on the musical presence of another and lets it develop.
In the beginning, of course, it was impossible to avoid comparing our work to Yonderboie&#39;s songs, always several of us separated from his band and went the other way.
hvg.hu: In the toplist of the mr2 Petőfi station, the song Wings of Love came in first.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, have you consciously opened up to wider layers?
B.Zs .: We didn&#39;t plan to write a hit to sell the record.
There&#39;s more to that song.
We intended it as the final of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs .: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to put together this choir of soloists from the domestic music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir was put together - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then renamed Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that exactly what you intended the song, or did the girls transform something into it?
B.Zs .: The composition has existed in the instrumental version for a long time, when the material came together on the record, we thought that something else would be needed for this composition.
The sequence of chords tempted him to join a singing part.
That day and night, I sang a melody to him, which the girls later learned.
It all came out almost for the first time and terribly spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but of course it took the Wonders.
It wouldn&#39;t work so vigorously with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
They don&#39;t have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don&#39;t have their own role, they sing completely together and they&#39;re not louder than the music, so the music just doesn&#39;t accompany their singing.
They also stood in the back on stage.
Is that intentional?
B.Zs .: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
On the contrary, the fact that we did not want to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting our ego a little bit, from where who is, where it belongs, and just letting ourselves be lifted by those wings, the wings of love.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born would be felt by others.
hvg.hu: Which was the most work with?
B.Zs .: During the composition of the music, in fact with none, heavier pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray&#39;s Dilemma, in which I play the concert grand piano, or Rock&#39;n&#39;Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn&#39;t want to work groove for a long time, then everything slowly found its place in a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs .: This is constantly changing with the concert and the fact that I have already &quot;released&quot; the record.
Now it&#39;s Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous broker risked billions out of inferiority
A treacherous fraudster.
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komerční banka, describes his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
She lost almost five billion euros because of him.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big banks, he recognized the early crisis in the US mortgage market.
&quot;He&#39;s mentally weaker,&quot; came his superiors, who sent police to him.
But according to Kerviel&#39;s statement from the French media, such as the daily Le Monde, he was a man who made 1.6 billion euros in profits from his business at the end of last year.
The crisis is not only in America
&quot;All I wanted was to make money for my bank,&quot; he says.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros from the American crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, news began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had problems with repayment in the past, would have problems.
However, this crisis should not have affected the whole economy.
Kerviel didn&#39;t believe it and bet correctly.
At the end of the year, its profit climbed to 1.6 billion euros.
&quot;Even when I made the first half billion, I didn&#39;t know how to announce it,&quot; Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn&#39;t keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so that he could not be found.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex exchange became interested in his trades.
The risk was profit
Was he afraid he would come to him?
Not really.
&quot;I thought that the simple fact that I had earned 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.&quot;
Where did he take the will to risk so much?
He had to work his way up to his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 shortly after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $ 51,000.
Two years later, he was an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $ 90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as others.
&quot;From my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development, &quot;Kerviel described to the investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares of Alllianz, he earned half a billion euros in the bombings of London.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we&#39;ll leave you
&quot;It&#39;s like a snowball,&quot; he told police.
But the bosses were said to know about everything, or rather suspected.
&quot;They kept their eyes closed while I was making money.&quot;
But then came the blow earlier this year.
He lost a billion euros in a single day.
After a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to wipe it out.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became suspicious because of his vacation.
&quot;I only chose four days in the past year.
A broker who does not have a holiday is a broker who does not want anyone to look at his records, &quot;Kerviel concluded.
The Czechia has a chance to raise 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programs, of which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czechia can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will go from the seven operational programs to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation program.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Program is the largest operational program and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
To date, the Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in drawing new funds from EU funds.
A 20-year sentence for the president of Nicaragua has been confirmed by a court
The Court of Appeal in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former country president Arnold Aleman, to which he was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud amounting to $ 100 million (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
It is not clear at this time whether the former head of this Central American state will return to bars from 1997 to 2002.
According to the president of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to prison officials whether to let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, a court proved to Alemán that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Alemán set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved our budget
It is so.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
He passed this year last year with the support of the CSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the CSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies approved this traditionally overlooked, although most influential, law in peace.
It&#39;s a paradox.
Every rule begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government&#39;s power rivalry with the opposition.
He is more grateful to the media and that is why he receives much more attention in the media.
Guessing politicians is much more interesting to the public than stark numbers.
State budgets in previous social democratic governments have suffered from three ailments that the one for 2008 is not able to solve at once:
The first of these is a high share of statutory, so-called mandatory expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved by the silent &quot;coalition&quot; of the CSSD and the KSCM last year before the elections.
The second is deficit management as a consequence of the ailment of the first.
The third limit is public finance deficits, ie the deficit of city and municipal budgets.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
He is public and relatively under control.
However, the time bomb is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to tax money, fees, and bank loans to obtain additional resources for investment, often headlessly issued bonds to over-indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts through the mass sale of shares of energy and other distribution networks, which they received from the state from privatization.
They no longer have this resource.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
For several years now, our economy, like the rest of the world, has been going through a growth phase, which the CSSD is constantly boasting about.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, they became more and more indebted to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, managed much more rationally than our republic.
It is a huge shame that falls mainly on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, the least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have swelled to gigantic proportions in recent years.
Although some of the nonsensical populist spending approved this year before the election has been abolished, unless the retirement age and pension reform are pushed in the near future, then virtually any policy in the country will end, and whoever rules it will be mere in office.
It is a bit of an exaggeration to say that the ruling politicians become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year&#39;s budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only suspend the crowding out of normal expenditures by mandatory expenditures.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely useless if previous governments did not manage what they could over the last ten years.
If we do not really want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we must be patient and allow this not very strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and fees, calm to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
Thus, more than one hundred billion dollars will enter the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks bid the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send forty billion dollars to auction, and another twenty-four will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the 9/11 attacks that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated approach to preventing or reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
&quot;This step is intended to solve the biggest problems of the economy, ie the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend,&quot; Bernard Baumohl from the consulting company Economic Outlook Group wrote in a report to clients.
&quot;Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to fifty percent,&quot; Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $ 60 billion in non-performing loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billion in losses.
&quot;Central banks need to be really worried about what else might follow when they decide to do so,&quot; said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
&quot;It looks like the situation is really bad,&quot; he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficulty accessing loans, they will also be more likely to lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy into recession with possible effects on global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about lending money to each other, even though the US, Canadian and British central banks cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
&quot;It will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates,&quot; Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move of central banks will help avert the crisis, because it does not solve the fundamental problem, and that is the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The ecologists&#39; debates are incredible
Developing countries are the most affected by global climate change.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now come to the end of the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he said that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, is unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
&quot;The debate there is completely unstructured, it&#39;s just a firework of words that are a substitute for solving current problems,&quot; Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President emphasized that its topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to it.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, &quot;I often come across caricatures of my views.&quot;
So now those interested can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus reminded that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion he has enough prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional dissertations, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
He identified the thesis as the main conclusions of the book that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that all scientists do not agree on global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not very great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change , inefficient and unacceptably expensive.
Moreover, as a person with experience of totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
Asked by those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against &quot;reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits&quot;.
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people did not have time to change their driver&#39;s license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange their old driver&#39;s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue them with a new card by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the road after the New Year without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the card was not exchanged mainly by those who no longer even want to drive.
While municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in exchanging a driver&#39;s license, authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed with applications and interest in exchanging a license has increased this week.
The municipality has around 2,000 clients a day.
The queues wait about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driving licenses.
It takes twenty days to issue a new card.
However, it is possible to request extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In such a case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns extra.
Motorists who do not manage to change their license by the end of the year and drive on the road without a valid driver&#39;s license will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also resolve the offense by agreement.
In the event of an administrative offense, the fine will be paid to 2,500 crowns.
According to earlier information, even a person who does not go anywhere could get a fine from the town hall.
He allegedly could have paid 30,000 crowns.
The ministry previously called on the authorities to be moderate and impose a maximum fine of one thousand crowns.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is facing a fine of tens of thousands of fines.
According to him, a driver&#39;s license is a document with which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not an identity card that every person must have valid.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver&#39;s license.
All you have to do is take it away or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal authority.
At the end of the year, the cards issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
Passes issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal association with David Berdych&#39;s gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
This was definitively decided by the Prague High Court, which reduced their sentences, one by one year and the other by two years.
Originally, detectives of the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime were threatened for 14 and 12 years.
Today&#39;s decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also indicted in this case, he is awaiting a first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences in excess of 16 years.
He can&#39;t get more.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of their participation in robberies, and the High Court today handled the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused have denied the indictment since the beginning of the investigation, saying it was a contrived case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police, in agreement with Berdych, passed on information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang handed over 30 percent for Opava and Koňařík for a magnifying glass.
The indictment is a gang crime from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious damage to their health, but also abuse of power by a public official and illicit weapons.
During house searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, bullets with a steel core, a laser sight or a submachine gun.
The gang allegedly lost tens of millions of crowns through robberies.
In addition to nearly twenty men in this trial, Berdych and a number of other people have already been found guilty by the courts of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych area are still confessing in court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought to court.
So far, the main trial has been avoided by Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, awaiting a final decision regarding their extradition to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
Child exchange bill: 12 million
Igor Veleba, a lawyer for injured families, wants 12 million crowns in compensation from the Třebíč hospital for the replacement of children in the maternity hospital, plus court costs.
For each of the mothers, three million, for fathers, two million, and for children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Therefore, the hospital&#39;s legal representative Ondřej Dostál fundamentally disagrees with Veleba&#39;s proposal.
&quot;We reject such a request, it is very, very high,&quot; Dostál said after today&#39;s meeting.
&quot;But in order to form an opinion on the counter - proposal, we need an expert opinion, which the other party had prepared.
We will find out if it has any meaning at all.
However, we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone, &quot;Dostál emphasized.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for each month they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb served as a basis for negotiating compensation with an expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol.
According to psychology experts and psychiatrists, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress to varying degrees and depths.
Men were better able to cope with the stressful situation, even though they struggled with reproaches for not preventing the replacement of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, are less able to cope with the topicality of the trauma they have experienced and with what is happening right now, Veleba summed up the content.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the Třebíč maternity hospital on December 9 last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermák family in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the Governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families to reimburse the expenses incurred by the fault of the Třebíč hospital, which the region is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for damage.
In case of mistake, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for the help of the founder.
Until now, the courts have awarded people relatively low compensation, the amounts were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Polívka lost the Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost a dispute over the Wallachian Kingdom brand.
According to a judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the Wallachian king used the name for the first time, but the project was built by a long-term team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case probably does not end and the client appeals.
&quot;The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Polívka,&quot; said Polívka&#39;s lawyer after the trial.
According to him, when everyone says Wallachian Kingdom, everyone thinks of an actor and a comedian.
Harabiš has the same opinion.
&quot;We have almost a decade of work behind us.
Raising money and inventing actions, &quot;he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
&quot;Over the years, they have realized that the project is a success and could benefit from it.
They want to parasitize on our work, &quot;he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the designation Wallachian king was first used by Polívka in his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At that time, however, it was not related to the intention to build a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessive event turned out to be trade and lucrative business activity, which Harabiš then followed up with the establishment of the Wallachian Kingdom company.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to include his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the bare idea that Polívka published in the arena for his business plan.
&quot;The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project,&quot; the judge said.
However, she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, which worked intensively on it.
The cooperation of today&#39;s disputing parties continued until the year 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the removal of &quot;King Boleslav I elected for the time being.&quot;
At the instigation of Harabiš, the singer Jarmila Šuláková took on the leading role in the kingdom as the queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which was dismissed by the court today.
Clearly, the battle for the throne and half of the princess planned by Harabiš could bring into conflict.
A new king should come out of him.
He did not want to reveal the details and date yet.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to rush anything.
It should be something like a ride of kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period.
Mr. Polívka can also apply, &quot;added Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearing prejudices
In fact, I&#39;ve never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of shifting, steering and also production could sometimes be described as below average.
But the market now has a successor to the Peugeot 207, and it&#39;s much better.
And the station wagon called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about headroom in the rear seats.
This is the end of the complaints here, because the body of the station wagon means that not even two-meter longs will suffer in this direction.
Flying around the world
I will go through the interior very quickly so as not to repeat myself too much.
This is a fairly successful design, where my only complaint is about the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention, when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The side guide has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
In terms of space, there is an increase in body dimensions here as well.
The already mentioned lack of space above the head disappears in the station wagon.
Suitcases
So the main thing about this car is its boot.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (even thanks to the tilting rear window) and as decently storable.
Deaf places are equipped with retaining rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not interfere, it can be stretched while holding even heavier objects.
But let&#39;s pause together over the volume.
According to the tables, it is 428 l in the basic arrangement, which is rather an average value compared to the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car in this class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav product, then we will find that Peugeot is lagging behind by a very noticeable 52 liters.
This value is critical for a holiday abroad or when loading a pram.
But if I had to highlight the positives, I still have to mention a completely flat floor after folding the second row backrests or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder petrol engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-year-old that drives a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has low consumption and above all it pulls.
If I compare it to the Škoda equivalent, which sometimes seems to have a rag stuffed into the exhaust, then I can only be excited about it.
The price list will tell
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must keep in mind that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a fourteen-liter petrol engine for CZK 329,900 will still run out.
Our unit costs from 410,900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then drop the equipment for another CZK 80,000 on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper lowering, electric rear windows ...
It&#39;s just that the car costs 531,900 CZK for everything.
It&#39;s a lot, but count the optional equipment at Fabia and you come up with a very similar number.
So all that remains is to opt for a brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is failing
There are more children from Eastern European countries in British schools, which raises concerns among local settlers about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and indigenous children escalate into violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Quarrels, bullying and fights between students also spread to relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, the police detained a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old pupil with an iron bar.
She accuses the boy of insulting her with racist insults.
The police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly treated the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
&quot;When we went home, a boy climbed to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw apples and pears at us, and then he revealed his ass, &quot;another mother of Slovaks described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the local settlers even called the disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools is becoming tense between locals and immigrants.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who have come here for work.
About 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can come true for you if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find this in a complete and even richer list.
But there is much more on just one island, and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Greater Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba used to be the stronghold of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and transshipment point for treasures that the Spaniards looted in America and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional was built at the very end of the 1920s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the USA (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise buildings grew up in Havana, and cars, which belonged to the cult symbols of the 1950s, drove along wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his yacht in Cojímar.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of Bodeguita del Medio.
And what about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls in Havana&#39;s Bodeguita.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional they will mix you a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s still drive around Havana, because the once-imported sacks and fiats have long since rotted in the salty and humid air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is considerably dilapidated, yet nowhere in the area are there as many beautiful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings much-needed money, its development is green.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more delight, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by trainers.
Steaming cane from large plantations was tied to sugar factories on narrow tracks by steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so there are working machines on display, whose contours are only elsewhere in museums.
Where to go?
Most visitors to Cuba will not miss the most famous places.
And so there is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in the already mentioned Hemingway homestead and whoever likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Viňales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viňales Valley in the west of the island.
Lush vegetation grows from the limestone subsoil.
Mogots, limestone clumps and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and fertile soil has taken hold in their cavities, thanks to which the weathered rocks are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet its final form by visiting one of Havana&#39;s cigar factories.
It may also be interesting to some that the Chilean part of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The slave and sugar trade brought him fame and fortune.
Wealth was transformed into the beauty and grandeur of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the 1950s there was no road connecting the region to the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, so nothing crashed, everyone was glad to have a roof over their head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places nearby, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening, visit the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music subsides in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is described by some as the most beautiful on the island.
Certainly such a view is influenced by the journey itself.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo have to cross high and rugged mountains and pass through nature that has hardly been affected by human activity.
Thanks to its unspoiled nature, UNESCO has inscribed the eastern island of Cuba on the World Heritage List.
They make the best chocolates there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (actually built about a hundred years after Columbus&#39; voyage) and from the hill where the former castle and today&#39;s Hotel El Castillo stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous being El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, the cabaret Tropicana, the shrine of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the sanctuary, the African religions professed by the descendants of former slaves, all of which would be many pages could be described.
But, as they rightly say, better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, say the Americans
According to the United States, few troops and a lack of necessary equipment are affecting the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban, eight participating states are now discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to be more active this week, Britain sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development aid.
&quot;Developments in Afghanistan are tangible, but military force can only be part of the solution.
The next is to allow the population to start the further development of the economy and security themselves, &quot;British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the US military, the activity of Afghan insurgents is the highest in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the Allies reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of units.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan troops.
&quot;We&#39;re going to have to think seriously about the specific goals for the future and the ways to achieve them,&quot; Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke in a similar vein today.
&quot;I am not happy about what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we need, and that&#39;s not enough, &quot;De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been controversy among participating countries in recent months over whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
&quot;The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the combat demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country, &quot;said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
&quot;Afghan loafers revealed: Germans are playing while our boys are fighting,&quot; Sun wrote in material supplemented with pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild counterattacked and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
Each Czech has a state debt of over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, it thus increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, it has decreased by CZK 13.4 billion since June.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October today.
Each Czech has a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
&quot;For the time being, it seems that thanks to a lower deficit for next year, we could only exceed the trillion crowns mark in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns, &quot;Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it similarly: &quot;We could reach one trillion during 2009.
When exactly will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could be postponed to 2010.
But I do not anticipate this change, &quot;he said.
Debts are growing
The state debt consists of the debts of the central government and arises primarily from the accumulation of state budget deficits.
Government debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the state has so far increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
So far this year, the state&#39;s foreign debt has increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called tradable state debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
&quot;Total debt grew by 13 percent year - on - year in the first to third quarters, which is really a lot for the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade when there is a pension reform, &quot;commented Pikora.
Better than expected
The strategy for financing and managing the state debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The amount consists mainly of the state budget deficit, which will probably reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
These are also the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, financing of government bonds for CZK 43 billion and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of CZK 1.8 billion.
The woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday night and deported, according to her lawyer.
The British woman was accused of letting six to seven-year-old pupils name the teddy bear Mohamed, despite the fact that any depiction of the Prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was punished with a whip wound.
The 54-year-old British teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after parents of several students lodged a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education. .
In fact, our story begins as early as September, when the teacher in question asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for a class teddy bear.
&quot;Children have eight names, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed,&quot; said Robert Boulos, the school&#39;s principal.
After a class vote, 20 of the 23 children eventually choose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of a teddy bear accompanied by the caption: &quot;My name is Muhammad&quot;.
The teddy bear itself did not wear any label with this name, but the problem is in the depiction of the prophet itself, which is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Muslim&#39;s fellow Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and would never do anything that might be offensive to any religious belief: &quot;I only regret asking the children to vote for some name &quot;, according to him, it is only an&quot; innocent mistake &quot;.
This view is shared by many pupils of the teacher, who describe her as &quot;very attentive to her students&quot; and add that &quot;she never talks about religion in class.&quot;
Recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second most frequently given first name in the UK, written in English in fourteen different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way to honor the Prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Sure, it&#39;s a matter of interpretation.
During the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome differing views on the future status of the separatist province.
&quot;It is unfortunate that both parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status,&quot; European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, emphasized that peace in the region was &quot;at stake&quot; and called on Belgrade and Pristina to honor their peacekeeping commitments and to be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations.
&quot;We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period,&quot; he added, adding that &quot;it is obvious that the situation is tense&quot;.
Negotiations end on December 10
Troika negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where the Albanian-speaking population is 90 percent, could be seen in a brighter light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are due to report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN commissioned the Troika to renegotiate in August this year.
Americans and Europeans expect talks to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo&#39;s independence from the UN Security Council, on the other hand, are insisting that negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
&quot;Russia was and remains in favor of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,&quot; Bocan-Kharchenko said.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance by the international community, the West sees Kosovo&#39;s independence under EU supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that, unless the Security Council decides in its favor, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
&quot;Unfortunately, we have not reached an agreement,&quot; Kosovo&#39;s president Fatmir Sejdiu said at a hotel in Baden, where the &quot;last chance talks&quot; have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, a former Kosovo Albanian insurgent commander and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade &quot;belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations&quot;.
&quot;Domino effect&quot;
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, believes that a compromise is still possible and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a possible unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the &quot;domino effect&quot; in an area that is still unstable due to the independence wars of the 1990s.
&quot;But it does not mean for Serbia,&quot; he said, &quot;that a compromise is impossible.&quot;
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
&quot;Kosovo&#39;s parliament will have the last word&quot;
&quot;Only a solution from the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,&quot; said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
&quot;These negotiations lasted for two years.
It must end as it began: on the premises of the Security Council. &quot;
He told reporters Fatmir Sedjiu that &quot;the last word on the status will be given to the Kosovo parliament&quot;, adding that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would take place &quot;in agreement&quot; with the West.
Bush has demanded an agreement from Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened on his initiative, US President George W. Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with the intention of resolving the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything in his power to help them conclude a &quot;peace treaty&quot; before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy &quot;terrorist infrastructure&quot; and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations of both sides under the &quot;road map&quot; to peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas were aimed at &quot;concluding a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues.&quot;
This statement covers three issues that are at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from the 1948 conflict from their homes in what is now Israel.
Abbas took the floor of the US President, emphasizing that the follow-up negotiations should be &quot;comprehensive and thorough&quot; and that it should address all aspects of the solution, mentioning &quot;Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things. &quot;.
Olmert then spoke in the rostrum, saying that subsequent negotiations should be &quot;direct and continuous&quot; and that &quot;efforts should be made to close them during 2008&quot;.
Bush has set the end of 2008 as the date for the realization of his &quot;vision of two states,&quot; Palestinian and Israeli, coexisting.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has made a commitment to Bush in this regard before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 wars, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means &quot;a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,&quot; Prince Saud said in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking daily under the auspices of the Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the Black Chronicle, the official versions do not coincide with what is said among the people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of a survey by the Inspector General of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car drove down Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 pm on Sunday.
&quot;The vehicle was not in emergency mode, but it was on patrol and was driving at a speed of 40 to 50 km / h, without the side lights on,&quot; explains a police source.
A green Kawasaki motorcycle, &quot;unregistered and therefore unauthorized to drive on public roads&quot; (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, was driving at &quot;very high speeds&quot;.
&quot;The motorcycle crashed into a police car from the left after he did not prefer from the right,&quot; one police officer specified.
The blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle crew turned out to be negative.
The condition of the car (punctured front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
Marie-Thérèse de Givry, Public Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that she had commissioned the IGPN to investigate &quot;acts of manslaughter and failure to provide assistance to persons at risk&quot;, which is also being taken by the department -d´Oise (Regional Police Directorate of the Val d´Oise Department).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
According to the official, three witnesses to the accident, who were interrogated on Sunday evening, confirmed &quot;the version of the police officers, namely that the mini-motor approached them relatively quickly from the left&quot;.
A scratch, no doubt caused by the friction of the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, rumors quickly spread among the people that the police were to leave the scene quickly without giving first aid to the two young men.
The IGPN should, with all caution, also rule out &quot;any serious wrongdoing&quot; at this point.
&quot;This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more searches and which must be very careful,&quot; said a police source.
The daily &quot;Libération&quot; met with an eyewitness to the few moments that followed the accident.
One of its windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
&quot;Immediately, my cousin, who is a nurse in a hospital, and I ran downstairs to try to resurrect them,&quot; the witness said.
There was nothing we could do &quot;.
Then he saw a &quot;limping, utterly frightened policeman.
Two others were trying to resurrect one of the young men, and a fourth was talking on the phone. &quot;
In the face of rapidly growing tension and the certainty of those present that the situation of the young men was hopeless, the police were taken away by a colleague&#39;s car, who had meanwhile arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived &quot;about twenty minutes after the police left&quot;.
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
&quot;Let no one claim that the police authorities did not rush to the aid of the young people.
These young men were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to save them, &quot;the prosecutor emphasized.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the declaration of a state of emergency by General Musharraf, two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahor, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against the emergency measures were wounded by tear gas grenades, which witnesses said were used by law enforcement.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were barricaded on Monday morning to prevent rallies.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers&#39; movement won the support of religious parties grouped in the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president &quot;urged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and garbage to those who swore an oath before Musharraf.&quot;
&quot;Musharraf&#39;s promise does not apply&quot;
Pakistan&#39;s Supreme Court is a direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was due to comment on the legality of President Musharraf&#39;s re-election in an indirect presidential election on October 6.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
&quot;Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the rulings of the Supreme Court,&quot; an official told The News.
Pervez Musharraf&#39;s promise to relinquish leadership and become civilian president &quot;does not apply&quot; following the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also otherwise refuted the country&#39;s ongoing speculation that a deputy army chief should have ordered President Musharraf to be sentenced to home.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unexpected
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is still unexpected today, reveals a study conducted by the French Institut national d´études démographiques (Ined) - the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called. Neuwirth&#39;s law, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
The enactment of contraception did allow for better &quot;fertility control,&quot; the institute said, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between the ages of 20 and 44 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births today are well planned.
One couple out of five even has a birth calculated for a month exactly and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of year for the birth of a child.
A remarkable space station repair
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed more than seven hours of space work to remarkably repair the torn solar panel needed for the station&#39;s continued scientific work.
It was a risky ascent into space that set records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, speed with which it was planned, and the degree of &quot;diy&quot; that astronauts spent on repairs.
The problem arose on Tuesday as astronauts from the Discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical structure designed for the installation of a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pad for laboratory modules.
However, they need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to relocate the seventeen-and-a-half-ton module producing electricity using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, to anchor at its final location.
After relocating it, the crew began dismantling the module&#39;s sixty-seven-meter solar panels.
And in that, one of the panels, decomposing like an accordion, was damaged on the surface of almost one meter due to the pinching of the cable.
Disassembly was paused to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a control ascent to the Discovery ship, and then go repair another solar panel whose rotation system had failed, were forced to pay attention to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the ship&#39;s robotic arm, added to the station&#39;s arm, and make a repair.
He is one of the best &quot;spacewalkers&quot; of the US Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, stocky, very agile, with a very developed chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, the physician was commissioned by a physician to &quot;operate&quot; an &quot;injured&quot; solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the defective cable and fixed some &quot;splints&quot; to the damaged areas.
He was assisted by a second &quot;spacewalker&quot; who remained near the balancing chamber, and also from inside, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the commander of the crew.
The tools he used, namely a mini hockey tape wrapped in insulating material to prevent electric shock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely disassembled, then invented his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday as scheduled.
EADS shares are weakening
EADS shares are losing ground on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defense industry announced that it would have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to face the delay of the A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to reconsider its expected production results for 2007 due to delays caused by the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the start flight.
The price for reducing delays in the delivery of military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was estimated at &quot;1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus&quot;, announced the parent company of the European designer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new earnings outlook before interest and taxes (EBIT) next Thursday, at the presentation of its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS&#39;s production results in 2006 fell by 86%, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380.
The group originally expected to deliver the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
Decision for the status quo
Sunday&#39;s election will take place without tense expectations: the Russians will elect President Putin&#39;s party, United Russia, by a majority.
Confirming, after the end of very little free the election campaign, its tendency towards stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver a pre-recorded television message to voters on public stations, but its contents are kept secret.
He does so from the position of the leader of United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which seems to celebrate a landslide victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president made nothing clear of him and contented himself with another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite topic during the campaign.
&quot;We know the price of true democracy and we want fair, as transparent and open elections as possible, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty,&quot; he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says &quot;there have never been such a dirty election, not even for Yeltsin.&quot;
Following repression at last weekend&#39;s demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned from visiting, according to his echo.
&quot;The Russians are left with the homo sovietica mentality&quot;
In the background of these tense expectations of parliamentary elections, two far more open questions are emerging:
- &quot;Who will become Putin &#39;s successor in the presidency?
The official letter yesterday announced the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates may introduce themselves to the public until 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
However, no follower appears.
- &quot;What role will Putin play after March?&quot;
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will elect a government and a president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the parliamentary as well as the presidential election.
It&#39;s a tradition.
&quot;The Russians have a homo sovietica mentality, they do not feel like masters of their own destiny,&quot; said sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the Levada Independent Center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University notes the more distant context: civil society has been delayed in this country, which has been Christianized five centuries after Europe; that glorious common spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, &quot;Putin followed the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so as this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror but by a certain economic prosperity,&quot; said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians &quot;voluntarily relinquish personal responsibility,&quot; which they demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
&quot;Why think?&quot;
This phenomenon affects all walks of life, including the business world.
The bureaucratic elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old professor: &quot;Why think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them? &quot;
Loaded memory
After more than sixty years in private, the Nazi archives in Bad Arolsen, which tell the story of the 17.5 million victims of Hitler&#39;s regime, are being opened to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored for 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have so far been accessible only for &quot;humanitarian&quot; purposes, ie individually and by name, at the request of the former victim or his or her beneficiaries.
Eleven states in charge of managing the archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians&#39; free access to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to examine &quot;especially the movements of prisoners, the camp population and the health of forced laborers,&quot; explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were against making these nominal documents available to the public due to the sensitive nature of some information.
Such as the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
Concentrations of concentration camps or arrest warrants set up by the Gestapo were gathered after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labor subjected to civilians, to provide them with proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
&quot;Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents,&quot; said prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität in Berlin.
The EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India amounts to almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India&#39;s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect a free trade agreement to be signed in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Bilateral trade between Europe and India already reaches almost 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India&#39;s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the ninth largest trading partner of the EU.
&quot;The free trade agreement is boosting both economies,&quot; and &quot;India will gain better market access to 450 million prosperous Europeans,&quot; said Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants &quot;47 billion euros in goods&quot; and &quot;ten billion euros in services&quot; each year, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission&#39;s delegation in New Delhi, said this week, regretting that bilateral trade had &quot;not yet reached its full potential&quot;. The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England acknowledged the concerns and offered £ 10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England announced on Thursday that it intends to allay current fears that credit market conditions will deteriorate again, announcing an offer of £ 10 billion in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an offer that has been unusually long.
&quot;In order to allay concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavorable at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty on how to hedge their cash position for the period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its planned reserve during the maintenance period beginning December 6 in the form of a five-week operation on the open market, &quot;she announced in a communiqué.
The bank specifies that £ 10 billion (€ 14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at a key interest rate.
This seems to be the first time that the BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They normally last a week.
The BOE adds in its communiqué that it &quot;remains ready to take further measures to keep interest rates on an interbank basis at the same level as its base rate.
The intraday interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest level since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to fee rates, which have discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to some speculations, fueled by the evolution of the pound&#39;s exchange rate against the euro, many have opted for amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank at lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union for People&#39;s Movement) and NC (Nouveau Center, New Center) refuse to address the Socialists&#39; (PS) proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Center clubs refused to discuss individual paragraphs of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is tantamount to rejecting the text.
The text of the bill was on the agenda within the so-called socialist &quot;nest&quot; (a meeting initiated by an individual parliamentary group) and contained a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the presidency of the PS, including an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the renewal of fluctuating TIPP, traffic check and rent regulation.
As the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s televised speech. on purchasing power.
The head of the deputies, PS Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his club would resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment bill on finances, which will be discussed by the Chamber next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of much speculation that C3 Presents is starting a new festival in Philadelphia, the promoter / producer has announced the Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the Republic Festival of the British organizer Melvin Benn.
&quot;It&#39;s an honor for our company to work with someone who, without exaggeration, has inspired the current festival movement in America,&quot; said Charlie Jones of Billboard.com&#39;s C3.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer destination for campers.
The festival is expected to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world&#39;s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006, Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been in charge of production, licensing and organizing for the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Calling Charlie Jones of Glastonbury as &quot;the most inspiring event&quot; he has ever experienced, he says his company and Melvin Benn are working together to give the region a European-style festival.
&quot;Originally, we chose Philadelphia as the market, and we worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia,&quot; said Charlie Jones.
&quot;We negotiated with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, due to the current management of the city, we got stuck in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
&quot;Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to start a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.&quot;
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago in 2005, after emerging on the festival scene in 2002 by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales for both events for 2007 were $ 9.8M and $ 11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in an urban environment.
&quot;The European model of the Melvin Benn festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in green spaces in cities,&quot; says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a way, so that we create the impression of both a rural festival in Europe and an urban festival in America. &quot;
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
&quot;The municipality of Vineland, including the mayor, is excited to support this event,&quot; said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but says &quot;that they are advantageous enough to allow you to invest in such an event and welcome a festival that will hopefully have a long duration.&quot;
Charlie Jones says the capacity of the festival is &quot;very high&quot;, similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which can accommodate 80,000 people.
He says invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed at a time when the program is just being printed.
&quot;Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music there will be varied to attract a wide range of audiences if possible,&quot; says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing a Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it ...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegate&#39;s tasks.
However, his mandate is &quot;politically demanding&quot; because California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns &quot;runaway productions.&quot;
Is it difficult to fall into the &quot;Governor&#39;s&quot; claws ??
&quot;It is important to be careful, it is the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he will go there.
Our job is to offer the ones they consider the best, &quot;he said.
The hunt for festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte&#39;s priority is to promote local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it&#39;s about presenting Quebec films, highlighting them, and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
The Age of Darkness had good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
this month, Québec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon on the stock exchange at the end of the year? Experts divided the &#39;subprime&#39; crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and investors are already shaking hands with me in the expectation of a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif Bank believes that &quot;from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange has a positive course&quot;.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially since, in the current context, markets offer some doubts, at least in the short term. &quot;
These experts do not anticipate that the stock market will move in the last weeks of the year, stating that &quot;the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity ready to invest due to the lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially solid income affected by the turnover effect on quality securities, both in long so in short sections &quot;.
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will run smoothly, rather than without volatility, &quot;mainly because the impact of the likely fall in Fed (Federal Reserve) rates is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of incentives for inflationary pressures.&quot;
Javier Barrio, BPI&#39;s head of sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the time to make bold statements about a marathon.
&quot;There&#39;s not much reason to rejoice,&quot; the expert said.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Nevertheless, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolio reorganization and traditional pension contributions that take place every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that everything will be a little different this year, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after an extended weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and &quot;that is why we could observe a reflection of the index caused by news from the USA about the consequences of the crisis in the credit market.&quot;
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles that will take care of bringing the Ibex to new highs.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that &quot;this year it is the turn of strong titles&quot;.
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, &quot;because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive.&quot;
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to get rich at this marathon if it happens.
&quot;ACS has been regaining its position for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and the FCC, will follow the same path,&quot; explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be in the forefront in the last part of the year due to increased sales during the Christmas sale period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technologies will also do very well, even if they are not very represented in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a month of declines in only two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will also see whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches, operated under the Popular Max brand, are a big change for the bank.
The same goes for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to make such a leap and bet on the non-stop opening hours of its branches until 8.30 pm and to open on Saturdays from 10 am to 8.30 pm.
BBVA, another group that has also reassured itself several times that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided to take this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for extending the opening hours by one afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of Popular Bank&#39;s experience will be crucial in whether or not other entities join this initiative, which supports the opening hours of shops.
This is exactly the goal of the project set by Popular Bank.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, sole traders and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, as it is not a question of opening new branches, but only of modifying existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches it already has in the business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients on individual streets.
This extends the opening hours to a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
Ángel Rivera, the bank&#39;s sales director, assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but more recruitment, as it is transferred from six employees per branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Banka Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
The branches on Madrid&#39;s Bravo Murillo, O&#39;Donnell and Gran Vía streets were chosen, and according to Rivera, it seemed like a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specialized immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and public holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, where many of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
&#39;We don&#39;t want to compete with our clients,&#39; says Rivera.
They have just agreed with Telefónica to sell mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco doubled the value of its rival Antena 3 on the stock exchange for the first time
We did it&#39;.
With this sentence yesterday, Paolo Vasile, the executive chairman of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of trading, when he stated that the television he manages has doubled the value of his rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: &#39;what I&#39;m sorry about is that it didn&#39;t happen because we would grow more, but because we fell less,&#39; he said.
At the same time, he stressed that due to the weak market, &#39;we have fallen less&#39;.
Telecinco yesterday ended trading with a shift of 2.54%.
This profit pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the stock exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) amounts to EUR 4,488.88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and has fallen by 40.5% overall since January, has a half value of 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were valued is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million in Prisa (published by Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion in Vocento.
According to Vasile, a comparison with Antena 3 is offered, as we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we will value it in the audience &#39;.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first television channel this year, surpassing Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group&#39;s advertising branch, by surpassing a billion gross advertising revenues.
If the forecast were actually achieved, this television channel would have seen an 3.6% increase in advertising turnover this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% (and thus reached 734.4 million), while the net revenues of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on for Telecinco&#39;s best relative performance on the stock market is the increased pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits to its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
&#39;We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope to be able to satisfy our shareholders, to whom we have already increased the value of Endemol&#39;s 33%.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its Telecinco earnings estimates to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the explanation that the projected revenue growth stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antena 3, namely by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approved the transposition of MiFID, effective November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations, which were concluded today with a Congressional vote on the amendments introduced by the Senate into the bill, the government held a public hearing on regulations developing the new law, with a view to both entering into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the parties unanimously emphasized the efforts of deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard in order to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the efficient functioning of markets.
MiFID, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernization of financial markets and at the same time strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between individual supervisory bodies of the European Union.
This new regulation will make it possible to provide financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons, and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs) that join securities companies, securities intermediaries. and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for conducting transactions in financial instruments is expanding by joining regulated secondary markets with multilateral trading facilities and order internalisation systems that will compete with current stockbrokers.
The law further obliges companies providing investment services to disseminate information on the market on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and ways of dealing with risk, and requires a record of all operations performed to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During discussions in the Congressional Trade Commission, several adjustments were made, including the exclusion of securitized receivables as a &quot;complex&quot; financial instrument given the high risk to the investor, as demonstrated by what has happened in the US with high-risk mortgage debt. (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used to legally define the positions that bachelors in economics and business management may hold 30 years after the Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which sets out the professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonized ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union&#39;s inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices in Spain developed during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modeling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (National Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure, which will become known on 14 December this year.
&quot;ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level&quot;
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said the November increase in the ISC to 4.1% was a &quot;temporary number&quot;, but predicted that the price index would remain relatively &quot;high&quot; in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes specified in the corridors of Congress that &quot;even if it will not be a favorable number&quot;, Spain&#39;s inflation differential with the monetary union has remained &quot;more or less&quot; the same over the last two years.
He also explained that November was &quot;less surprising&quot; than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
&quot;We expected a value of around 4%,&quot; the economy minister said of the data presented today.
Virgin plans to earn € 42 billion with Northern Rock over three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £ 12 billion (€ 16.8 billion).
At the time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than £ 25 billion, which gradually declined over two and a half months due to client distrust, despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for the money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity&#39;s name with its trademark Virgin Money, needs to raise about a quarter of the revenue invested in UK banks over the next three years to raise the remaining £ 18bn to reach the $ 30bn target.
The group of mogul Richard Branson, known in the United Kingdom for its striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend £ 50 million (about € 70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its commitment.
This week, Northern Rock described the Virgin consortium&#39;s offer, which consists of three other companies, as the one they would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for allegedly corrupt practices during construction
The Civil Guard detained the current mayor of Murcia, Totana (People&#39;s Party), in the early hours of the morning because of his alleged involvement in corrupt construction practices, which were unveiled this week.
One of the town hall secretaries and the head of the local police were also arrested.
In May of this year, José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People&#39;s Deputy and until then the mayor of the village, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER television, may have been the &#39;head&#39; of the entire company.
Police officers continue to monitor the town hall and construction commission buildings, and further arrests in the coming hours are not ruled out.
In addition, a lawyer for Juan Morales, the main suspect in corruption in construction practices, was accused earlier this week.
As Caden informed the SER yesterday, the lawyer of the &#39;People&#39;s&#39; MP Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested on leaving Morales&#39; residence with important documents related to corruption.
In addition, according to investigative sources, the subject of the investigation is Morales&#39;s alleged collection of commissions for his signing of a construction agreement with a Galician construction company, which reclassified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently being detained.
Bono accepted an offer to head the Toledo PSOE candidate and, if they win, to preside over Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE (Spanish Workers&#39; Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo in the next general election and to become chairman if the Socialists win the general election. Congress.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of the PSOE for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero, which took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of the party.
The head of the executive justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life &quot;it is important to count on the best&quot; and Bono &quot;is among the best&quot;.
He further noted that &quot;yes, it seems&quot; that this La Mancha politician will be the Socialist Party&#39;s candidate for President of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono, as President of Congress, would replace Manuel Marin, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run in the next general election and to leave his active political career to pursue climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister had constantly urged him to return to the top politics he had abandoned two years ago.
He added that just as citizens know who will be the Deputy Minister of Economy if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce &quot;in a transparent manner&quot; who will chair Congress.
If Bono gets this position, he hopes to turn the House into a &quot;house of respect and not swearing or shouting&quot; and achieve that &quot;it will become more and more like citizens&quot;.
&quot;Unfortunately, at times, it seems that the only place in Madrid where there is no peace and quiet can be Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion.&quot;
He also praised the current chairman, Manuel Marín, and &quot;his good work,&quot; and did not want to imagine himself in his place yet, so as not to diminish himself by stating what his opponents might consider &quot;greatness.&quot;
Climate propaganda
As the anti-climate change movement is subjected to ruthless persecution, both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must show strong cohesion.
In addition, to have a leader of the movement who is prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a &quot;new treaty with the planet&quot;.
This proposal forces him to explain why the actions or inactions of his government have made a significant contribution to Spain&#39;s leadership in the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors is it happening and why his government, the treaty government, has not prevented it.
In addition, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spaniards what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be harmed by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what will be the economic consequences.
In other words, who is sacrificing and who will pay to save the planet.
But we have not received such explanations, nor will we.
Precisely because it is necessary to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers&#39; Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapatero in terms of the election that he hurried to reject it.
In other words, it is a matter of saving the planet so that it does not cost anything, pure propaganda, slogans lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not blame, does not demand anything, but is the decoration of meetings and arouses tenderness.
Unless he&#39;s just being a virtual party and not asking us to ride a bike and cool off with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totana detained on suspicion of corrupt practices during construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcia city of Totan, the &quot;People&#39;s Party&quot; José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a hospitality businessman, on suspicion of committing construction crimes.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, where he now houses a number of police officers who also visited the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Land and Flats.
The three arrests were made in six last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land into land suitable for development, to the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the past election period, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested, but are charged in summary proceedings in the court of first instance of the city of Totana.
The first six arrested were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People&#39;s Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
His ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the Autonomous Community, were also charged.
Manuel NA, director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José MG, director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and through which bribes were passed.
The investigation is being carried out by the criminal group in the construction of the Civil Guard Operations Central Unit, whose members, in addition to arrests, also carried out eleven searches, mostly at arrest-related companies based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid province) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, a well-known owner of a poultry product company in the area, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcia city of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a &quot;spa&quot;.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was to double the settlement of the village, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which support the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking on the streets of A Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in Vigo, Hogartel, a direct marketing company, and Preconiza, which focuses on for the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday&#39;s issue of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on November 18, the same day Circumstances also revealed a critique of Blackburn&#39;s book:
&quot;The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The victim killer, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche in his reports.
Pekka Elo, the councilor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, called on the Helsingin Sanomat daily for professors to take a critical stance on Plato, arguing that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in a compulsory basic course in philosophy in high schools. &quot;

One colleague informs about the introduction of the crime of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal boards in a shop for less than 400 euros, this is considered a mere offense (§ 623.1).
B. If you steal up to EUR 1,000 in a shop, theft is already a criminal offense, but the penalty rate is lower than for withdrawal (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less important to take part in a brawl than a compact shift.
Participation in the riot has a rate from three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts the rate would be from six months to two years
(§ 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punishable more than the provision of pornographic material to minors (§ 186).

My doctor pushes me one of his articles on strange research called &quot;Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less.&quot;
Or the feelings evoked by the monthly salary of employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph, and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life &amp; Brain Institute in Germany: &quot;The biggest activation occurred when the researcher reacted correctly and his colleague reacted incorrectly.&quot;
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, activation was mild, but when one received double, activation was higher.
I really don&#39;t know if this conclusion required so much science.
Plaintiff in the Balkans
For eight years now, Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly persecuting criminals from the Balkan war from the state prosecutor&#39;s office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her term expires at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits in the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on a list from Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach&#39;s documentary &quot;Karlin seznam&quot; (2006, not shown in Spain), which follows the work of a Swiss prosecutor in persecuting fugitive criminals and putting pressure on the states from a detective thriller at Belgrade to New York. to pull the net.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense, which depends on various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driving license, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, it is necessary to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company will receive the agreed sum insured in a certain amount for taking responsibility for paying damages in the event of an insured event.
Premium is the price of insurance, which is determined with regard to various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driver&#39;s license, type of vehicle that is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely an accident is to occur, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of inspections, insurance companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the journeys and thus the probability that it will have an accident.
As the frequency of rides increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the price of a premium.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best suits his profile as the insured.
We will show here the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to satisfying the type of insured, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 face various disadvantages, such as little driving experience and a short holding of a driving license, when they want to negotiate premiums at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a discount on insurance premiums in order to obtain insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would presuppose the client&#39;s co-participation in the payment of the insured event.
&quot;The part of the indemnity paid by the client will be determined in advance when determining the premium price, the higher the co-participation,&quot; explains Luis Noguera, chief executive officer of First Europe in Spain, an internet insurance broker.
Another option is insurance extended to other road users so that the client insures himself against damage caused by other people, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendation.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
In contrast, a malus is an increase in said base rate.
&quot;The bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus, &quot;explains Noguera.
After exceeding the limit of twenty-five years, drivers find it easier when they go to take out insurance, as the client&#39;s risk index decreases, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all risks at a discount.
&quot;Young people are usually unable to benefit from the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident, nor when driving,&quot; says the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when &quot;fear of a newcomer&quot; .
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to take out insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows it.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a discount of premiums (which could be 300 euros) or, with a high bonus, insurance extended to other road users, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
&quot;Their driving is calmer and their purchasing power higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount,&quot; notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to take out insurance against all risks with a discount of premiums (amounting to EUR 150) or insurance extended to other road users if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would suit us best given our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get a point on AC Milan, which means the round of 16
AC Milan and Celtic will test their forces this Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an effort to score the point they lack to reach their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, as it would mean being the first for Italy and the place for the Scots.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured promotion in the fifth match in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs one more to make sure that the Six-Point Shakhtor, who will play with Benfika, who has four .
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will play their thirteenth semifinals for the first time, in an effort to advance to the finals of the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed sooner than the others and a tie at Giuseppe Meazzy&#39;s stadium seems most likely, even if both teams try to compete for victory, because the Italians will not want to tactical at home and Celtic knows that after winning they would be first and secure would get a better place in the round of 16.
Even a loss could be enough for Gordon Strachan&#39;s team if Shakhtar does not win, but he cannot rely on it, because with the same number of nine points, the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow last week (2: 1) but won in the first live match, will advance. (2: 0).
And so the players of AC Milan will try to ruin the evening of the Scots, who believe that they will reach the semifinals in the reorganized Champions League for the second time, just as they defeated them in the same match in the last competition with Kaka in overtime (1: 0) after 0: 0 in basic playing time.
Hoping that the &quot;rossoneri&quot; will win will be Shakhtar, for whom he has the price of victory, only if Celtic loses, both for advancing to the round of 16 and for remaining in UEFA.
Benfica, although the last and does not have the opportunity to continue in the highest European competition, could win third place with one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 viewers since they broke up in 2000.
&quot;Posh Spice&quot; (Victoria Beckham), &quot;Scary Spice&quot; (Melanie Brown), &quot;Baby Spice&quot; (Emma Bunton), &quot;Sports Spice&quot; (Melanie Chisholm) and &quot;Ginger Spice&quot; (Geri Halliwell) shortly before launch their concert at GM Place in Vancouver, they said their reunion was &quot;great&quot;.
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video telling the group&#39;s history, which caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
The comeback and world tour take place at the same time as their release of a new album released by EMI in Spain, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, &quot;Headlines&quot; and &quot;Voodoo&quot;.
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage adorned with bracelets given to them by husband &quot;Posh Spice&quot;, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, although nervous Victoria forbade him to do so a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that &quot;he didn&#39;t see our costumes at all, so I&#39;m nervous about what he thinks of the show.&quot;
&quot;Sporty Spice&quot;, whose departure from the group in 1998 &quot;due to disagreements between us&quot; caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also expressed its nervousness when meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the performance.
&quot;Iwas afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that world public opinion had changed, my opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, so I&#39;m glad I made up my mind, &quot;Chisholm said of reuniting a group she had dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, &quot;things have settled and we all love each other very much.&quot;
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So in the beginning, according to CTV television, the group flew to Vancouver with a special Virgin Airlines.
An army of nannies was waiting for them at the airport upon arrival.
Five has a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Fears of a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A dispute over gas prices is currently under way between Russia and Ukraine, increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and Russia&#39;s state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
&quot;It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations,&quot; Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
&quot;Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine.&quot;
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a sharp drop in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of them remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS &quot;must control foreign employees&quot;
The inspector said that the Scottish NHS chambers need to improve criminal records checks on non-European staff.
The recommendation from the President of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was connected to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate idea of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key inspections went well on a sample of five health authorities.
Immediately after the June attacks on Glasgow Airport, the President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel recruited from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Twenty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of being connected to bombing attempts in the UK.
NHS chambers are expected to check foreign staff for qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK before they are employed.
Although Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland for criminal records checks, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that commissions should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with inspections in several countries.
&quot;Although we found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these inspections, they are not carried out regularly,&quot; the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS was largely in line with its own pre-employment screening policy, but added: &quot;Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of foreign staff.&quot;
Chairman of the BMA Scotland dr. Peter Terry said it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
&quot;The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what additional value these comments will bring,&quot; he said.
Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers will probably be higher also because the commissions had a problem identifying staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the control procedures in place at the NHS in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely implemented.
They included checks on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its pre-employment control policy and guidelines for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: &quot;I wanted to do this job immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport.&quot;
She added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with the health commissions, would consider the report&#39;s recommendations and ensure that best practices appeared in the updated pre-employment inspection guidelines for all staff - including foreign ones - which it plans to issue next month.

Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
The awards were also won by star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and in the supporting role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller Notes on the Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety award for getting a British film on the world stage.
The awards were presented at the Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis&#39; path to fame with the Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - whose soundtrack features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £ 3 million.
But he won two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for his iconic U2 album cover Joshua Tree - for Best Director and Best Debuting Director.
Rock music was the focus of another winner - as Julien Temple&#39;s film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the Best Documentary Award.
The badge for the best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen for the role of the driver of the Russian mafia boss in the London thriller David Croenberg&#39;s Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation based on the role of tough guys, won the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
The man in his fifties, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another Indiana Jones work - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he is proud of the award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
&quot;People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me,&quot; he added.
&quot;I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He is my man, a great actor of his time, I am very honored. &quot;
The Independent Film Awards, known as Bify, are presented by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bif supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia has arrested 208 people for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities, as well as on clerical and security forces.
State television, the largest oil exporter, said that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since 2003, the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction force to defend the facility from al-Qaeda&#39;s failed attack on the world&#39;s largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted the ministry&#39;s internal statement as saying: 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a &quot;rocket launcher&quot; who slipped into the ground.
She added that the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare for the murders of clerical and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent Saudis from leaving for Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting Allied troops and the US-backed Shiite government, which conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al Qaeda militants believe the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - backed by al-Qaeda leader Saud Osama bin Laden&#39;s calls to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - focused on foreign housing, government buildings and energy facilities.
&quot;This war has been a huge effort by security forces over the past ... five months,&quot; an internal ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member &quot;media cell&quot; in Medina was also arrested to promote &quot;Takfirian thinking&quot; - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports violence against Muslims identified as unbelievers and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a glimpse into the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the orbiting European station show that the planet is even more like the wayward twin of the Earth than previously thought.
Venus is the Earth&#39;s closest planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are about the same size and orbit in similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could be habitable.
But the frightened greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and lower rotational speeds sent Venus on a completely different path of evolution.
Today, the planet is without water, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead and is ravaged by storms and hurricane-force winds.
Findings from the European Space Agency&#39;s Venus Express spacecraft, which studied the planet for a year, offer a modest look at how the Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of Oxford University&#39;s Physics Department and one of the heads of the Venus Express mission said: &quot;It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
&quot;Our new data allow us to compile a scenario in which Venus began, as did Earth, perhaps with its habitable environment billions of years ago.&quot;
Police detain &quot;enriched uranium&quot;
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched in uranium, was detained by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $ 1 million (£ 480,000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it was not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions to a video and passed them on to candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, Nov. 28, were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party&#39;s debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot about the state of the Republican Party heading for next year&#39;s elections.
It is not clear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the strongest Republican themes.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something pleasing: the broadcaster noted the peaks of agreement as candidates spoke of a tough approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the country&#39;s main candidate, and Mr Romney, who pushed forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two struggled especially fiercely when interviewers asked if any of the candidates would support &quot;amnesty&quot; (giving illegal immigrants normal status and citizenship).
Side candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their bit into the mill on the subject.
Neither of the two has a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game, perhaps because they started sounding the alarm for immigration earlier and harder than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have roughly the same opinion: greater strictness at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the conflict between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very uncomfortable when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbled through this to the point that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn&#39;t believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another interviewer asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who now ranks first in a recent Iowa poll due to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was annoying but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too clever to run, earning him laughter.
The fight remains extremely open.
Mr Huckabee&#39;s rise in Iowa coincides with recent success in raising money and Ron Paul&#39;s loud cheers in Wednesday&#39;s debate.
The two bounced back from the bottom, as the two wings of the party still cannot agree on better-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very soon and convincingly with a triumphant report of American greatness on his lips, winking at both wings of the party.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labor Pain
Gordon Brown again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
No orders seem to have been sold, no bills in a Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked.
But barricaded Gordon Brown would do without it being discovered that a wealthy businessman had disguised £ 650,000 ($ 1.3 million) in contributions to the ruling Labor Party for four years under other people&#39;s names and that the party had not announced it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling elections and insulted the British intelligentsia by claiming that the decision was not influenced by polls, there was hope of ensuring a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly humorous Deputy Speaker of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of troubled Northern Rock Bank has shown weakness in management and poor judgment under fire.
Badly thought-out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative slackness.
The three retired generals started a revolt in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending because they claimed that being a commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now here are the many gifts of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the secretary general of the Labor (and their former watchdog of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading for his end.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a tipping point beyond which they find governance difficult.
People don&#39;t trust politicians and don&#39;t like them, but they usually push away their mistrust when a new group takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and may not be in office for long, this postponement is gone: the government is becoming leaky, ministers are starting briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one respect, Mr Brown&#39;s position is particularly difficult, as he cannot take the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and the tax office&#39;s records are linked to decisions made by Mr Brown as finance minister.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blair&#39;s trouble, such as the lengthy investigation into political party funding caused by &quot;ranks for money,&quot; voters can safely conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown&#39;s troubles aren&#39;t as bad as they seem.
The touches aren&#39;t as awful as conservatives do.
As for Mr Bean, no one has died or been explicitly deceived.
And the treatment, however painful it may be, is to deliver what Mr. Brown&#39;s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm, and slightly brutal government.
The latest uproar over political donations is a good example.
Garboid, Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
Laws against the anonymity of major political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who might buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew of Mr Abrahams&#39;s actions but did not know that they were illegal, would certainly be questioned thoroughly; as well as Jon Mendlesohn, a major Labor funder who learned of tricky gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved yet; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these plots, although the bulk of the payments did not take place until after his inception in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He very quickly condemned the violation of the law by his own party, but diluted his resolve by reaching for a proven tool, a commission to investigate the matter - led in addition by a retired bishop and judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of political party funding.
This would require Labor, who is in a tight spot, to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a devoted party like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in polls; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to win the victory is unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the subprime crisis affect the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, the dorsal fins naturally begin to flutter excitedly.
Now that the US real estate market is wither, predators have focused on the local credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts say credit card losses could infect $ 99 billion if inferior mortgages became infected from subprime mortgages.
Signs of tension are clear.
There is a growing number of cases of inability to repay (with more than 30 days late payment) and debited accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable).
HSBC announced last month that it had lost $ 1.4 billion in the US consumer credit market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
However, it is still early to panic.
There are still few written-off accounts and inability to repay.
According to the rating agency Moody&#39;s, the insolvency rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below average in the third quarter.
Deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
A change in US personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which account for a large portion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers have deteriorated.
The industry also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts per month.
And confidence in the securities of secured credit cards is strong, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the research company TowerGroup predicts that their emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct ways to spread the infection between the subprime crisis and the credit card market: when real estate lending dries up, consumers tend to borrow through credit cards.
However, credit card issuers look at cash flow rather than the value of guarantors, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They can even be beneficial for lenders.
Consumers&#39; motivation to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their property falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up the list of priorities for repayment.
Card issuers are also able to respond more quickly and flexibly to more turbulent conditions than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of a rapid change in the prices of guarantee items.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t happen that one fine morning we just reconsider all the loans,&quot; said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
Although the risk of a subprime-style explosion is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt cuts push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers pleaded guilty to the Enron case
Three British bankers, who were to be tried for their roles in a fraud involving former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, changed their statement on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded guilty to seven allegations of fraud, when they and Fastow were denied financial fraud in 2000 - to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers.
They were due to appear in court in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. everyone confessed to one scam.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, figured on the front pages for the entire two years of the extradition process.
In the United States, their case is one of the open parts of the investigation that began after the 2001 Enron crash.
The allegations against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron crash.
The indictment against the bankers - who earned the nickname &quot;NatWest Troika&quot; - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot the fraud with Fastow and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest has invested in Enron&#39;s Fastow-controlled subsidiary of Enron, the architect of many of Enron&#39;s scams, which spiraled Enron to bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its stake in this branch at zero, but our three Brits knew that it was in fact of considerable value.
The company, under Kopper&#39;s control, bought the bank&#39;s stake in the branch for $ 1 million.
The incriminated bankers paid Kopper $ 250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misleaded Enron that the energy company would pay $ 20 million for its stake in this Greenwich NatWest subsidiary.
But the 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers received $ 7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about $ 12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two conspiracy cases to his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were released on bail of $ 1 million, which ordered them to remain in the United States for an upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country&#39;s seventh largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after, after years of accounting gimmicks, it was no longer possible to hide billions in debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has cut off thousands of jobs, more than $ 60 billion in market value and more than $ 2 billion in retirement insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of their roles in the company.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than twenty-four years.
Lay&#39;s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were dropped after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow&#39;s helplessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for a non-stop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $ 54 million.
For some of Russia&#39;s rich, however, these are small returns.
&quot;It can carry up to 18 passengers,&quot; said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
&quot;But none of them are interested in so many jobs, because it&#39;s for a close family or a corporate president.&quot;
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire&#39;s Fair, a four-day orgy of flashy consumption at a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers set up their stalls, hoping that newly-rich Russians would lure everything from mahogany-lined yachts to diamond-shaped car counters for which they wouldn&#39;t be ashamed of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the side stall.
&quot;It&#39;s a nice car, but there are fives and dimes against us,&quot; he said.
&quot;After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.&quot;
On the waves of oil, money is pouring into the Russian capital just as it did when Dallas had its days.
&quot;We went through the same stage in the 1980s, when some Americans got enormously rich and moved to Europe, where they were seen as materialists,&quot; said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi spreaders of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world&#39;s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part in this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, the luxury industry conference attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is hosted by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires with a total fortune of $ 282 billion, according to Forbes magazine&#39;s richest list.
In addition, the local center for the Center for Economic and Financial Research has released a report on personal wealth developments in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 &quot;second-rate&quot; millionaires in Russia, with a total of $ 670 billion in assets.
(The World Bank states that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence level.)
&quot;There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that&#39;s why we&#39;re all here,&quot; said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
&quot;All women are perfectly groomed, and men are each worth their fortunes.&quot;
Twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and five-year-old Svetlana Turovcovova branded herself and her clients millionaires as they walked through the halls in Sunday evening.
&quot;I&#39;ve been looking at those cars and I can&#39;t decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,&quot; said Miss Yumatov, who was wrapped in designer clothes like a red carpet veteran, next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a home hand.
The fair seemed to focus mainly on fresh rich people, brand-run Russian shoppers who are willing to sit for several hours on the road to walk through the warehouse, which mixes Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai, plush Gund and draft.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($ 44.57).
&quot;The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best,&quot; said Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt&#39;s life-size painting of hand-painted blue tiles.
&quot;Of course, the Russians are more interested in tinsel.&quot;
Indeed, local sellers say that Russians with old money (by Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have moved from flashy logos to little-known limited edition brands that would never show up at a shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or ordinary tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
And some of them shopped.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, local general manager of King Koil beds, said he had sold two mattress sets made of silk, cashmere and cotton, interwoven with gold threads, for $ 70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company had sold a bright orange Porsche for $ 170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of LA Connection, which customizes luxury cars, said he had sold three bars of interconnected chain bracelets for Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $ 55,000.
He showed the reporter a car wheel designed for a Russian casino owner that had a string coated with Swarovski crystals that looked like roulette.
Price: $ 22,000 for four such.
&quot;The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich skin bikes or a portrait of his wife in cubic zirconia does not have to ride those bikes yet,&quot; Mr Karapetian said.
&quot;He&#39;ll store them in his garage of thirty to forty cars.&quot;
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr Karapetian said the phrase &quot;Russian millionaire&quot; does not mean anything very exclusive at present, given the large rise in local property prices.
&quot;If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you&#39;re probably a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,&quot; he said.
&quot;There are more than you think.&quot;
Those who aren&#39;t millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth run by Russia&#39;s Alliance Continental, an asset management company.
The company has erected four red British-style telephone booths stuffed with columns of counterfeit million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company&#39;s marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit notes for the Millionaires Fair.
Passers-by stopped to scatter around a pile of money, take pictures of their friends on their mobile phones as they rested in the midst of spare wealth, or simply stuff their pockets with a few million.
&quot;You know, anyone in Moscow can feel like a millionaire,&quot; Mr Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey may have been caused by a corrupt operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the large windows of the slightly healthier restaurant and watched the ambulance arrive at the white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car soon joined.
And then another.
&quot;Then I saw a medical examiner&#39;s van arrive,&quot; said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
&quot;At that moment, I knew someone had died.&quot;
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant to the director of the Newar police department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet identified what caused Miss Arroyo&#39;s death, and they hope that toxicological tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of grief to the Newar police.
Miss Arroyo has been an assistant police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
&quot;She was loyal, tenacious and worked hard,&quot; Mr McCarthy said of Miss Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
&quot;She was my shield.
She would protect me. &quot;
Mr McCarthy said Miss Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newar police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that he was leaving two sons, aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine if Miss Arroy had died as a result of unlicensed surgery.
&quot;It&#39;s one of the options,&quot; said Miss Walsh.
&quot;The investigation is still ongoing.&quot;
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o&#39;clock in the afternoon.
November and found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh did not say if the authorities had heard Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a surgery.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro&#39;s house, with a damaged rose bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel with the words &quot;Ethyl Vanillin&quot; sat in the open garage - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes hung on hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark in the New York Police Department after 25 years, Miss Arroy gave him invaluable help in tackling the intolerant and harsh political culture of his new city.
&quot;She said, &#39;You should watch out for this or that,&#39;&quot; he said.
&quot;She was always there when I came, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing. &quot;
The hope that the Fed will cut interest rates leads to a strengthening of world stock markets
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm lending conditions by further cutting interest rates were fueled by reassuring statements by the deputy chairman of the US Federal Reserve.
Stock markets jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second to Fed Chairman Ben Bernank, said executives must be &quot;flexible and pragmatic&quot; in response to continuing pressure on financial markets.
As part of an apparent effort to calm irritated markets amid signs of a resurgent credit effort, Mr Kohn said recent excitements &quot;partially reversed some of the improvements in market functioning in late September and October.&quot;
He added that if the increased instability persists, the possibility that the financial conditions of households and companies will worsen will increase.
Investors see the statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver more fresh capital injections to US markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid further bad news about the US economy, with apartment sales in record numbers low in October.
The effects of the financial turmoil were underlined by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of cost reductions to offset heavy losses due to a failed bet on subprime housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these jobs are expected to be closed in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&amp;P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index strengthened by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, while the value of British blue-chips rose by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index rose 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets proved to be in full force after the European Central Bank &#39;s three - month money package auction lent these funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release above-standard money on London&#39;s money markets has increased as rates on the three-month British interbank lending &quot;Libor&quot; have risen to a maximum since late 12-September since mid-September - 6 59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six at bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection board, who holds the position for the best time on loan, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help, and because the desk of Hugh Morris, the general manager, English team, begins to fill applications for the post of national collector, though not necessarily full-time.
He who is not placed in the sixth place at the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets through the lower level, sometimes due to a lack of luck rather than abilities.
Not only in cricket, the selection is difficult and requires an opinion, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if not?
We could ask the same thing in another area, let&#39;s say that here: John Edwards or &quot;Tubby&quot; Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and an overview of the industry, should be promoted to the commission - the place is only for one .
Who has to say which level is right for a cricketer if he doesn&#39;t get a chance to drop or swim to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a big influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
In a team, a cricketer must catch the captain&#39;s eye at the right time to take a wicket, and a batsman needs a regular chance at starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the collector&#39;s gaze is more complicated.
For example, last season was much better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched like an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett took just 29 on an equally meager average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for another.
Whether he will play at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice may kick off or finish both careers, or it may not have much of an impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and performed well in the first class, five wickets and 40 overtimes, but it was Paul Collingwood who fought for his seat at the same time who eventually became a stable Test cricketer. which, moreover, is even though he scored twice a hundred points in Australia against Australia, may still be underestimated.
Graveney, Vaughan and Moores are more likely to follow their conservative instincts, preferring Shah&#39;s greater experience over Bopar&#39;s youthful exuberance, after one more discussion following today&#39;s training at Asirgiya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test innings at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 hundred in first class speak for the six Bopars, who are, at the age of 22, seven years younger and have excellent statistics against spin throws.
However, Shah made only ten runs in two innings against the Caribbean in the Test at Lord&#39;s, his home course in Middlesex, in May, along with an immediate refusal from the pickers when Vaughan wanted to re-cast him for the next match, his batting seemed to take something away. from the zeal that was so evident in Mumbai.
In contrast, the Essex universal has joie de vivre in his bones.
He is not frightened by the cricket field, and his off-field behavior is symbolized by a recently overturned four-wheel drive car on the exhibition day of the English team&#39;s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and apparently shock, but first he pulled out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who was watching from a distance, to ask him excitedly, &quot;Did you see that?&quot;
Bopara is definitely better in the field, he distributes his medium-speed skid throws on the local courses, which seem to suit him, efficiently and fires confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that&#39;s the real art of choice.
Personally, I am inclined to give Bopara his chance now, but I do not mean that Shah will not excel unless, as Ceylon&#39;s tea leaves suggest, he will be the one to play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to the fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, dumping refugees who ran out of money or had their visas expired, and others hoping the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who had driven them from their homes.
Mansour Bus Station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
&quot;I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad,&quot; said Sabah al-Kubajsi, a Sunni doctor.
&quot;I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
&quot;They say the Mahdi&#39;s army has stopped killing people,&quot; he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Muktada al-Sadr, who had temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amaria, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visas and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaria called on him, saying that a local militia with the support of the US military had helped push al Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who was expelled from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He returned to fight.
&quot;The day before yesterday, several friends called me and told me that they were launching an anti-al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That&#39;s why I came back today, &quot;Sabaah, 62, told Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the appeal of the pacification in the capital after the strengthening of the US military presence and the growth of local &quot;groups of biased citizens&quot; defending their neighborhoods with weapons in hand alongside the US military.
But they talked more about being forced to return by visa obstructions and a loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, has voiced a shared suspicion among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, has asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas, forcing them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sect killers.
&quot;Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to return to Iraq,&quot; a Sunni retiree said.
&quot;I can&#39;t trust the government, which supports the criminals who burned my house after I left.&quot;
Part of the reason for the escalation of violence is the fact that Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, which reduces tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little Saarland, good education
Germany&#39;s smallest federal state plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even in the international focus of its universities.
In only one educational field is Saarland concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
&quot;I explained to a person who is not from the Saarland for the fiftieth time yesterday that we are not French&quot; - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in the Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the smallest federal state&#39;s birthday.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar education system, which ranks fifth in the education monitoring of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Universities have traditionally worked closely with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their studies here with a double or even a triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high share of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saar children are accepted to university - many of them even without studying at the grammar school.
&quot;The Saarland uses a vocational education system,&quot; says Axel Plünnecke, IW&#39;s educational expert.
Saarland is more than 7% above the German average, with more than one in five adolescents being eligible to study at a vocational school.
Compared to the rest of Germany, the Saarland has a wealth of opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two fields are the second best in all of Germany in terms of population.
Despite practice-oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saar Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering.
&quot;After the first Pisa study, we implemented several reforms in general education schools,&quot; said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model adopted by other Länder.
Only comparative studies will show if pupils&#39; results improve significantly.
When the Pisa study was conducted in 2003, the proportion of at-risk pupils fell from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other Länder.
Bavarians can count better.
And to the disappointment of the Saarland, Pisa&#39;s studies do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise the Saarland could score points in this area.
The language of the neighbors is compulsory in grammar schools - even if the inhabitants of the Saarland are not French.
Chavez moves the clock
What not to see will be hours in Venezuela differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will have the clock in this South American country moved back half an hour.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
The official newspaper of Venezuela reported that according to the new law, the clock will be shifted by minus four and a half hours compared to world time.
The South American state will take this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States forced the division of time zones into hours for the world.
In addition, on Wednesday local time, Chavez announced that he was severing ties with neighboring Colombia due to a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe became president of Colombia, he would not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
&quot;I can no longer because of my self-esteem,&quot; said Chavez, who is pushing for constitutional reform, which the people of the oil country must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The quarrel was sparked by Uribe&#39;s decision to revoke Chávez&#39;s mandate to negotiate hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe &quot;spat in the face&quot; of Venezuela with his decision, Chibez criticized Uribe on Sunday.
Also in Spain, everyone is talking about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone caused a stir here: &quot;Por qué no te callas&quot; (Why aren&#39;t you quiet yet?) - this is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
She was uttered by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was so upset by the left-wing populist&#39;s loud remarks at the recent Ibero-American summit that he silenced him in this way.
Germans face lower pay in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are facing a reduction in real wages this year, despite a strong economic situation.
Experts justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, employed people in 2007 can realistically expect to receive a lower wage than last year.
&quot;The culprit is a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in food and energy prices,&quot; Gustav Horn from the IMK (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) research institute told Bild.
New burdens on employees may also await in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% for the new year is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency should not again fall into such difficulties as to have to demand loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, the newspaper quoted this social democratic politician as quoting.
It was announced on Tuesday that the price explosion of food and oil products had driven inflation to its highest level in thirteen years.
In an annual comparison, prices rose by a total of three percent.
Venus is the hellish twin of the Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought. The European spacecraft Venus Express on Venus has detected phenomena that also occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European Venus Express probe has brought evidence - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. Lightning flies from Venus from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles wrote in the scientific journal Nature.
According to the well-known theory of the origin of primordial matter, life could have arisen on Earth due to lightning. Storms have reportedly triggered reactions in the oceans that have led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
This was not the case on Venus: &quot;If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago,&quot; explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, something alive would hardly be found on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 ° C.
&quot;Venus may be the hell&#39;s twin of Earth, but it&#39;s a twin,&quot; Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to the Earth, began to evolve completely differently is a fundamental question of the Aces mission.
Since no probe has been sent solely to study Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of the Venus Express spacecraft in November 2005 was a milestone in the planet&#39;s research.
According to scientists, the latest research, which was presented in several articles in the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
&quot;They also showed that our neighboring planet is more similar to Earth than previously thought,&quot; Aces said.
In addition to the already known wind vortices at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that spins much faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth&#39;s northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is made up of almost the same mass as Earth and, with a diameter of 12,100 km, is almost the same size.
This planet, called Dawn or Evening, will orbit the Sun in almost 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower around its own axis. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus, with a surface temperature of 460 ° C and a pressure of 92 bar (abbreviation for bar?), Does not resemble Earth, scientists assume that both planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water has accumulated on both. On Earth, however, it remained in the oceans as it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel&#39;s meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to party disputes over the Dalai Lama&#39;s admission to the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany&#39;s reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the feud over the Dalai Lama&#39;s reception.
&quot;We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue,&quot; Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
&quot;Although I respect cultural differences, human rights are universally valid for me,&quot; Köhler said.
Although the federal president emphasized that everyone knew that Germany had to maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent him from defending Merkel when he was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
&quot;The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China also knows that, &quot;Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his opposition to the Dalai Lama&#39;s acceptance, and was attacked by the coalition because of it.
Among other things, Steinmeier complained about the coalition&#39;s &quot;demonstrative&quot; foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government revoked the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL, it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the two countries&#39; foreign ministries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China&#39;s position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas also located in China, is trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest that has erupted in France
Street battles with police, shootouts, lighted cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar unrest that has broken out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not escalate into street violence, calls on the Federal Minister of the Interior.
The barricades were on fire, and rioters fired shotguns at the police. Following serious juvenile riots in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
&quot;We have to be careful not to create social tensions that break out in violence.
We have to take it seriously, &quot;he told the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person is able to cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, the state and the municipalities are already working hard to eliminate the problems, Schäuble said.
Which does not only mean the integration of migrants.
&quot;From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we are seeing our first successes.&quot;
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of France.
In recent nights, teenagers and police have fought hard in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Cars and public buildings were also on fire in Toulouse.
Kenan Kolat, the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, demanded greater integration efforts by the German government.
With regard to the riots in France, Kolat warned of the &quot;imitation effect&quot;.
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, it should be.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is &quot;above average&quot;.
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a larger number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed: &quot;We have to give teenagers hope.&quot;
However, the chairman of the Turkish community added that in Germany, unlike in France, there is greater social control of families.
In addition, many young people from migrant backgrounds do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted, &quot;But we must be careful.&quot;
We need to &quot;enable young people to&quot; quickly start working and learning. &quot;
Meanwhile, the night in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely quiet.
Hundreds of police officers were deployed and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several lit rubbish bins and cars.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 deployed law enforcement forces have taken care of the peace.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
About 80 police officers were injured in riots on the outskirts of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The next night, riots engulfed Toulouse.
The mess was caused by a car accident on Sunday, in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of the juveniles.
In Angela&#39;s realm of &quot;Clouds&quot;
The Chancellor&#39;s distant output documents that the coalition is programmatically at the end and that we can no longer expect anything more from it.
In what country does this chancellor actually live?
After her bleak, indifferent-sounding and content-poor speech at the general debate of the Federal Assembly, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, administer.
Angela Merkel once responded to the reproach of concentrating too much on foreign policy with a very arrogant sentence.
It&#39;s provincial, she said, showing that she didn&#39;t want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Bundestag, she visibly showed everyone how much she deserves the reproach.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a feeling for the country&#39;s problems.
Instead, Angela &quot;Oblaková&quot; introduced herself: a politician who excels over others, who flees to foreign policy and even there she speaks only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it continues to praise the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but it no longer says how the climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
And in general, such praise - so much immodesty, the CDU chairwoman would have forgiven herself two years ago.
She is now limited to vain phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, it damages its image of a pragmatist who does not need to flatter because she solves problems.
But in Angela&#39;s &quot;Cloud&quot; empire, internal political problems are a side issue.
Child poverty and worries of low-paid people?
She had a few side sentences on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel is renounced when it comes to child allowances.
Merkel has to start three times from the beginning in order to be able to say at least partially the correct sentence.
As soon as things become too specific, it stumbles like in a completely foreign terrain.
Department Attack
Republican presidential candidates&#39; debate on Youtube has sparked heated debate over favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both must now fear the outsider&#39;s candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already evident in the first topic.
Mitt Romney predicts to his opponent Rudy Guiliani that he has made New York a &quot;refuge for illegal immigrants&quot;.
Giuliani reacts quickly with sharp remorse: &quot;I think his own house was just one such refuge,&quot; he replies, telling the former governor of Massachusetts that he privately employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are attacking. Given that the Republican base does not yet have a clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their rivals.
The half-minute videos, shot by Internet users and sent via Youtube, serve only as such help on a key topic.
&quot;This is exactly the policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to seize power,&quot; John McCain predicts to his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one to push for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain does not spare Romney with his remorse for refusing to condemn a torturous interrogation method called &quot;Waterboarding&quot;, in which heating is simulated.
Audience Reaction in St. Petersburg, Florida Petersburg show that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are among the important topics of the campaign.
The audience bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
&quot;I was wrong then,&quot; Romney explains in a state of disappointment, asking the party base and the television audience for forgiveness for being an advocate of abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on a literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civilian life for the first time
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf took the presidential oath on Thursday and will remain in the presidency for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast a live ceremony held at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office as army commander-in-chief to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, under international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By resigning as commander in chief of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Chief Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after his oath, thus fulfilling another of the West&#39;s demands.
The country&#39;s supreme court, which Musharraf occupied lawyers in favor of him in early November after declaring a state of emergency, rejected all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state on October 6 last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured in an attack on a military convoy in the North Waziristan tribal area.
An army spokesman said a bomb had exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Krautrock Fathers are back
The famous German band of the seventies plays again. Three members of Harmonia took up their electronic synthesizers again at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, an excerpt from the band&#39;s most successful period.
Even then, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists in the performance of three sedentary gentlemen, who at first look as if they are just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and, most importantly, buttons in front of them.
Sixty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt is sitting in the middle.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and guitar in front of him.
Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, who is leaning over the synthesizers, is on the right from the viewers&#39; point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, certainly inadvertently, a traditional composition is created.
The musicians don&#39;t seem to mind.
The revival of the band Harmonia caused a great stir among krautrock lovers.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that while this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, it is definitely not so well-known that someone would painfully miss this band for twenty-three years.
But why can&#39;t a German even celebrate his still-living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when he values the style of music, mistakenly called krautrock, in England and America more than in his own country.
When the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne band Can the Echo Prize for Life in 2003, the hall was full of questioning views from German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! In their speeches, the astonishment of the audience no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later sat with them on stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia, we unnecessarily overburden the memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time it was far from having the effect that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they performed in the basement of the Schaubühne Theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a church-run record company.
Rother briefly helped out with Kraftwerk, but gained a reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu !, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster into exile in Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as members of a commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to work as a nanny.
Rather, it was life in such a Spitzweg artistic being.
The name for the art is said to be derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the trash.
Harmonia kept much of it.
The first album was called &quot;Music from Harmony&quot; and the following &quot;De Luxe&quot;.
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting grates was not just about self-knowledge.
The now released CD &quot;Live 1974&quot; was allegedly edited during a concert in Griesse in front of a record-breaking, barely fifty-member backdrop.
At the time, Rothera expressed a desire for Harmony members to run and exercise occasionally.
It was an utterly rude request for Roedli and Moebia.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album &quot;Burning Heart&quot;.
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His record company Grönland aimed to preserve krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
New band! was considered Roedelius&#39; solo work at the time.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
The British, Julian Cope, an old punk and the author of the &quot;Krautrock Sampler&quot; will be present.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
This outlined the overall breadth of krautrock&#39;s influence on future pop music.
Harmonia will fill the empty space of the famous group.
Brian Eno&#39;s movement, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: &quot;Unique real music, it belongs to the future.&quot;
There are paintings in which the producer and Harmony are in a peasant seat.
The projection of other black-and-white photographs, on which a set of devices are wildly connected by cables, also contributes to the creation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No more gluing microphones to the organ and drums to get the never-before-heard self-produced tones out of the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three punctualists immersed in the technique.
The choir of the House of World Cultures does not change anything.
Led by Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and sings &quot;Aaaaaaaa emphatically&quot; in one beautiful place!
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
We would find our roots in music universities (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster) rather than in blues.
The one who shouts &quot;&#39;68!&quot; At this point is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not let himself be disturbed even now.
Even the most obvious are carefully thought out on stage.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question either deprives a person of his nerves or allows him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn&#39;t cynical enough
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But none of them are convincing.
The original films either place too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
An actor like Richard Gere won&#39;t stop this at The Hunting Party.
The good news first: War criminals Karadzić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Lately, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he has played many pleasing, reckless roles in cool female films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on Buddhism, they take a craving for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the Hunter Becomes Prey (Why do movie titles have to be so long and tangled these days?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter, Simon Hunt, is basically who Gere could have become if fate and the film industry hadn&#39;t been so merciful: a man who has had his best years long, but as a wreck-like monument, he still retains a remarkable charm. .
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which is also entering theaters this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of failed films about the war in the Balkans.
We can do a short trial with Mörderischer Frieden: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, after which one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television shallow film turns into shooting and action too soon.
Something very similar to the Cobra 11 series will remain from the film, albeit without the highway, but with the war.
In The Hunting Party, you can clearly explore why a really good film has not yet been made about the Balkan War.
The story of three American war reporters who go after the &quot;fox&quot;, the Serbian chief war criminal, could at another time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (here both Richard Shepard) could become the new &quot;Apocalypse&quot;.
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something that the army is not capable of, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for The Hunting Party&#39;s failure is that Simon Hunt is not the debauched and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft also prescribes a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim.
The Hunting Party can be definitively written off after reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film do what NATO, the CIA and all the world&#39;s criminal hunters have failed to do in the last five years: catch the criminals and leave him to avenge revenge on Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worthwhile to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
At the same time, this film has a deeply human message.
He condemns the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (who are exceptionally united here) that they are not intensifying enough about persecution under secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, we think of Brecht&#39;s famous poem.
It is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer&#39;s desk: &quot;I look with compassion at the swollen veins in my forehead, noting: how hard it is to be evil.&quot;
In films like The Hunting Party, exactly such swollen heads appear, but they indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the war in the Balkans.
Recently, the newspaper reported that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were major setbacks.
There is only one thing to add: no good film has ever been made about South Africa.
It&#39;s almost always true: When a star wanders around a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Boundary of Breaking with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio is made.
Maybe all those conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust - Schindler&#39;s List.
Many films seem to have matured - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - &quot;Deer Hunter&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse&quot; or &quot;Lead Vest&quot; - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The screenwriters then do not have the ability needed to tell good stories flawlessly.
&quot;To be or not to be&quot; or &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; had become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how horribly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don&#39;t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe he has to form a sarcastically measured artistic look like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
Asked about the parallel between his historical novel &quot;Lemprière&#39;s Dictionary&quot; and &quot;The Balkan War&quot;, he declared: &quot;The form lies only in the fact that some things never change.
Cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia. &quot;
Von Beust reaps criticism for renouncing the Olympics
The mayor&#39;s resignation from the holding of the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg met with sharp criticism from politics and economics.
Many want to continue fighting for water games.
But Von Beust encourages realism in estimating the chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, called the decision &quot;unfortunate from a business point of view&quot; on Wednesday.
No other project has recently aroused as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
&quot;Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sports-political enthusiasm to such a high degree.&quot;
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, &quot;based on a changed timetable.&quot;
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday at his earlier statements that Hamburg&#39;s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
&quot;Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic candidacy,&quot; von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sports Association will decide on Munich&#39;s candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
&quot;For us, this preference means that with a timetable of 2028, we have no realistic chance.&quot;
Yet the dream is not over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust&#39;s remarks regrettable.
It gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to run for the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
&quot;It is still too early to ruin your chance by calling the plans buried at this early stage,&quot; HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
To renounce running would be in conflict with the statement made by the head of the senate at the general meeting of the General German Higher Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg&#39;s candidacy for the Universiade in 2015 as a replacement for the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg University Sports Association did not nominate a candidate city until last week.
The SPD faction in Hamburg&#39;s Senate parliament has criticized it for wasting valuable time that could be used to build housing in Hamburg.
&quot;The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years, as it has opted for the Olympics and ruled out housing construction,&quot; said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD was still planning the Olympics for the Klein Grasbrook area, with the whole area later to be used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the &quot;Olympic factor&quot;.
Applying for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
But Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These are not Warhol&#39;s boxes
Anyone who combines the terms Sweden and wooden boxes does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or yes?
Wooden boxes currently made in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol&#39;s list of works.
Most of his ninety-four Stockholm-type &quot;Brillo boxes&quot; listed are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper &quot;Expressen&quot; expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol&#39;s &quot;Brillo boxes&quot; from 1968 a few months ago, internal research by the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has yielded a disappointing result; The six &quot;Brillo boxes&quot; donated by the former director Pontus Hultén to the Moderna Museet in 1995 are copies - as are most of the other &quot;Brillo boxes&quot; of the Stockholm type in circulation on the international art market.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden crates that were based on the red-and-white-and-white design of Brillo&#39;s soap powder paper boxes.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 presented - with Warhol&#39;s consent - hundreds of Brillo cardboard boxes. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their models, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo boxes in Sweden, but they are not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time now speak of fifteen boxes, which at that time rightfully entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - &quot;Andy Warhol&#39;s Brillo Boxes&quot; marked Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $ 100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968, about a hundred boxes were made and displayed in Sweden, which Warhol left to him.
In fact, 105 Hulten boxes were made in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
At that time, Warhol was three years after his death.
In addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, Lars Byström, chief conservator of Moderna Museet, also examined three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood boards were primed. and sanded, brushed with oil white paint.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies revealed that the paint had been applied directly to the plywood board without prior priming - in addition, it was acrylic and not oil paint.
&quot;These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol&#39;s official list of Brillo boxes,&quot; said Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet: &quot;Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York reaches different conclusions, Moderna Museet will need six boxes from their exhibition collections are classified as &quot;exhibition material - copies&quot;. &quot;
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would address these &quot;key allegations&quot; of soap powder boxes.
However, the organization still remains in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who fortified themselves in a hotel in Manila surrendered and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Insurgent leader Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had fortified themselves in the building.
About half of them were on trial on Thursday over a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the meeting to flee with about 30 of his supporters.
The military police who were supposed to guard him apparently ran to his side and joined the uprising.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president convened an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers&#39; act.
&quot;People have had enough,&quot; Triallnes said.
&quot;We encourage people to join us.&quot;
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said that other military units would join the march shortly.
Critics of the government have called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been blamed for corruption.
As early as 2003, the Manila financial area became the main scene of a revolt of about 200 troops against Arroyo.
Because the army refused to join the rebels, the uprising failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, they have tried to overthrow a democratically elected government at least seven times in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured more than a 20 percent stake in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05% of the share capital.
Previously, there was speculation about a takeover.
The company is still considering the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is working to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5% to 15.1%, entry speculation emerged on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this financial institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet already had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold another 17.4 million new shares worth 106.4 million euros.
Of this, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL and mobile network products.
&quot;We are strengthening our partnership,&quot; a United Internet spokesman explained.
In order to take over the competing company Freenet, the companies together set up an SME joint venture.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies will be satisfied with a share of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and will not exercise their right to take over another 18.49% of this company.
For the time being, the companies are considered to keep all options open, in particular the possibility to further increase their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet regarding the strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This months-long and difficult-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract mobile customers and 1.27 million full or DSL customers.
Holding United Internet and Drillische has so far held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It is now reportedly agreed that Drillisch will gain about another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
