Economia and the Centre connect management.
They will offer, for example, joint advertisements
The new integrated newsroom of the company Economia in Prague's Karlín district.
Economia took the next step to transform the Centre holding into its media house.
From Friday, Economia and the Center have had joint top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the personnel union is essential for the integration of both publishing houses into the joint media house," comments the changes made by Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economie and commissioned CEO Kamil Čermák.
Čermák, who will head the unified management, will be joined by the Executive Director of the Centrum Holdings, Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil was appointed as the new joint director of the business, to whom the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tylčerová, is subordinate.
The new head of information technology was Stephen Burda.
The joint director of the editorial staff is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team includes the director for the transformation, Jakub Unger.
The newly established marketing director's role was commissioned by Adéla Pitts.
The independent unit of corporate communications is now run by Věra Lhotská.
The joint finance director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will, among other things, enable us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the content of all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," Čermák added.
Economia, which is owned by the financier Zdeněk Bakala, concluded a contract to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this April.
The Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of the servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto, or a portfolio of nearly two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, news server IHNED.cz, weekly weeklies Respekt and Ekonom and a number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, he has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of his major titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported the news.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the attack on it was not confirmed by the Israeli government.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli military, when asked by CNN, declined to comment on the information about the raid.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
The target of the Israeli raid, according to a US government source, was a missile and related equipment that the Israelis thought could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, reported that the target of an Israeli raid on a target on Syrian territory was Russian missiles SA-12.
A second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was the allegedly highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area, however, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles, according to DPA.
In addition, they said, they showed a battery of missiles SA-3, including a radar command center to track missiles and their targets.
The recorded missiles have a range of 35 kilometers, according to the Israeli television report, and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed to have intervened in any shipment of weapons destined for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that a return was unlikely.
In a late-night interview to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since his resignation a decade after a ten-year leadership position, Mr Blair has mostly avoided interviews on British politics, confining his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy to the Beezac's Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his response from the London-based newspaper Evening Standard quoted as follows: "Yes, of course, but that's hardly the case, will, so ..."
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport for shooting
There were shots fired at Los Angeles International Airport in the morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport for this, allegedly a terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, says the lawmen shot dead a gun with an armed man.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to police, said there was a shootout that injured two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration.
How many people were injured in total and whether there are any victims but it is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an incident with more injuries.
Berdych and Stepanek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
For the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing Czech tennis captain Jaroslav Navil nominated the four Tomáš Berdych, Radek Stepanek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech national team defends the trophy, but are going to play on the pitch of their opponents in the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from November 15 to 17.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going to the hot ground, that it's going to be wild and we need to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Stepanek, the architect of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Brno observatory takes visitors into space in new digitarium
At first glance, it is clear that the great planetarium's hall has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can dig into the new comfortable seats, and a 17-metre domeem in diameter has been added overhead with a dome in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It is about twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Brno observatory, Jiří Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"Computer performance is 30 to 40 times higher than that of classic personal computers," said the technician from the observatory, Tomáš Hladík.
The digitalarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body, or the bottom of the ocean.
Viewers find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a person.
Another similar facility is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to screen purchased shows and their own productions in the hall.
There have been two shows on the agenda since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is for adults.
In it, people learn about the astronaut training, go into space, turn into centrifuze, and then see, on graphic examples, the challenging conditions the astronauts in the cosmos face.
The second show is for children and is called the Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colourful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment of the eruption of a nearby volcano.
The entire digitarium cost roughly fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
Smaller Brno and the observatory from its budget also contributed smaller amounts.
The area of the design cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed up by audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory passed through two years ago.
According to director Dušek, 25 to 30,000 visitors could still come by the end of the year.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's Health Care Act
The Supreme Court in the US ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a vote of 5:4, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which mandates citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, or face a fine, against the Constitution under the administration's power of taxation.
The president of the court, John Roberts, stood on the side of the four more liberal members of the court, while Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remainder of the Act on 2700 pages and further ruled that the statutory health care requirement that mandates states to expand the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise threatening to acquire all the financing of sickness insurance from federal sources, is not law enforcement and contrary to the Constitution.
The action to block that law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 primary, the law was strongly rejected by each of the leading Republican candidates, including the presumed proposed nominee Mitt Romney.
Nadia Konvalinková in the role of the innkeeper.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Nadia Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub and was very good at it.
Had the popular Czech actress planned to change the profession and go to business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinka appeared in James Joyce's Irish pub and was a beer.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I was good at it.
Even my boss offered to hire me and I could make a living by beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stick with what I do to this day, with acting," Konvalinková, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub's operation, revealed with a smile.
'I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey here and there,' the actress said.
Nadi longtime friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I am dead and I mustn't drink in my current new life.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I try to keep that," the actor added.
Egypt puts first freely elected president in office
Mohamed Morsi took the inauguration, but his triumphant day is hard to end with political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Morsi promised "new Egypt" when he was inaugurated as the country's first freely elected president, after Hosni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his commission before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office before 18 judges clad in black gowns in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony a live broadcast on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer graduated in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of fierce attacks by individual governments for most of the 84 years since its creation as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time, the building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak's presidential flamboyance, traffic was only briefly halted to allow the motorcade to take the usually busy route connecting the city's center to the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, mockingly referred to as the non-charismatic "reserve tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has grown sharply since his victory and his speech on Friday, which aimed to present him not only as an Islamist candidate, but also of all those who want to see the rebellion towards the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state," Morsi, clad in a blue social suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wood-pand-parking chamber where he swore an oath.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to give an inauguration address.
As he stood at attention, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander of the field marshal Hussein Tantavali was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the chants of the "army and the people are the one-handed" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square on Friday, the place where the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian government was born, and solemnly promised to seize the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took them over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath in court rather than in front of the parliament, as is customary, he has acquiesged the will of the military, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Anyone who really wants to get to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit reveals more than a walk through the aleanating center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than the bedekr would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves."
They roar slowly through cemeteries, gaining intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities, what beliefs they are, how big and cohesive families they belong, at what age they die here, how important they are to them, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they will find out how the bereaved heeded their dead.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up late, and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a cheapskate.
For two years, there's no candy in my apartment, and this year is probably no different.
However, the statistics show that I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), this year's most Americans – in fact 158 million of them – will celebrate Halloween and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and ornaments.
But what I look forward to every time on Halloween is trendy.
According to the NRF, $6.9 billion spent is expected to go to $1.2 billion for costumes.
This year, the latest fad fashion is the sexy inanimate object.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; it can also be sexy to eat like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As for the men, I expect the parade of the dead to see a lot of zombies, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will make it to our channels in Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we put our dogs in costumes and, to my astonishment, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, the Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for animal pets.
So he'll see a lot of funny dog.
When it comes to sweets, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans spend $1.9 billion.
That's roughly 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is amazing news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters who are about to raid our neighborhoods, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.
In fact, we buy during Halloween, and believe it or not, consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectionery, nearly 16,000 tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" "Howl-O-Scream" and "The Horror of Shock" and "The House of Shock Shore).
In fact, there are officially insiders in the United States of 1,200 haunted houses that, according to the company's haunted houses, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos that you're watching the fears that your friend puts on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like takes a look at the photo and comments on the "you face nicely."
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
Even when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to a large pumpkin (Great Pumpkin) and carving a pumpkin lantern is kind of like decorating a Christmas tree - we've done it since we were a little kid.
Fortunately for us, the "chin niece" trend started thanks to the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up to carving the gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the US Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with the flickering flame on your front porch is probably from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut up their pumpkin weighing almost one ton.
How the Insecters from Thailand picked up the sales of the Paris bar
You may be scraping at the insect, and yet you have no idea that you eat it quite voluntarily every year.
For example, grounded in the flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nourishing and a unique experience you are also taken care of.
The insect's offer was the first to be placed on the menu of his establishment in Paris at the beginning of October by Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, which was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, would be found in the fashionable 18th arrondus near Montmartre by well-visited by tourists.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can now bitten not only various larvae, locusts or water beetles, and scorphevi can be tasted here.
Carefully and specially packed vans (so as to make the insect's wings not damage, your legs don't get damaged, or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects; it is common elsewhere.
The owner of the Paris bar with the pioneering menu lists several reasons to consume insects.
The first is an ecological benefit, because insect production is much less costly for our planet (what is concerned with finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, simply aiming to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant is a pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere of the environment.
"I don't save the world, I'm just conveying a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be excited by the idea of how a beetle consumes, decorated with pesto, but the reaction of the Paris bar's customers to the in-service insects is, according to the owner, very positive.
Even the skeptics are said to eventually taste it, even if they begin with the smallest bites and finally choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting saucers range from five to nine euros.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands CHANGES and NALADA.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with resolving an unsolvable role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group, which had washed their hands after the set-mates, made a much more optimistic impression than the one where its participants' hands were nothed.
The group's "with washed hands" also performed better in the next test than the other.
Yet those who washed their hands, worse scores in other tests than those who did not have washed.
The results of the "arty" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not record any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that the physical purity removes really negative feelings after the failure.
At the same time, motivation is decreasing, with the test being much more focused on the next tests.
If we had transferred the research results to the Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic when we returned from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs are not wearing their hands, but along the way through city transport it is already a fifth.
Hygiene is also usually also stuck with work in the garden or workshop, when 85 per cent of people wash their hands.
The pet's covar's house-cumbor meater motivates 78.7 per cent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after a handshake to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a bit better," commented the survey's survey by the skin doctor, Klaudie Komárková.
A tunnel for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico was found with its own railroad
It has been able to discover one of the most sophisticated drugs smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, supplemented by its own lighting, ventilation and an electric railway.
U.S. officials described the tunnel measuring roughly one by one meter as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds to a length of nearly six football fields, connects a warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, in the US.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before the drugs could be brought in undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also intercepted eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who authorities say were working as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
If convicted, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life in prison.
In the town of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are infiltrating large drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which puts the problem of how to get its product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres equipped with tracks that ran from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
Is Europe's elite ready for trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign (commerce for Britain) was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and define what changes in the relationship with the EU to see British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1,000 leading businessmen representing British businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The survey results will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritising new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged in a long and arduous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked for their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels' regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European trade area – even by 40 per cent of large enterprises, the most pro-European companies, have so traditionally.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most telling knowledge, that the unequivocal majority wants Britain to strive to amend the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not policy.
The findings, with which businesses of different sizes and the main business groups have endorsed, show that the business sector is pushing for a "meaningful change" that will take back the influence back on Britain.
There is a lot at stake – achieving a treaty change and a better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% in the referendum vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift away from the current rebalancing of the forces back to the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and, given the eurozone's journey as a closer economic and fiscal union, is increasingly necessary.
The priority must be for jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of our survey show, this means a renewed focus on trade for business and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
Pamela Anderson had these iconic blonde curls "curled" and put on a new, dramatically ropping haircut.
Pamela's blonde hair is famous for her role on the sexy show Baychau.
Pamela Anderson is the newest celebrity who shocked her fans with a new hairstyle.
The Coast Guard's Ex-kgard got rid of her long blond hair and put on a platinum romp haircut.
This 46-year-old actress revealed her last look change when she went out in LA on Wednesday and posted a picture on her Twitter page.
It's the first time this blonde beauty has had short hair in her 20 years, and we like this restrained change.

The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and North England will start as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project would "twone the UK together."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he had been "experposed" by working with the British Government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of the Phase Two, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which held talks with the national transport office of Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to identify additional railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for the North and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: ‘Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that will better connect the UK and its cities."
We gave SH2 the green light because the benefit it will bring is enormous.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also a link – across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected thanks to the United Kingdom.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added, "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
Under the Scottish Government, Mr Carmichael, Mr Carmichael called for a 'one-figatal' Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed line has the potential to bring immeasurable economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case of the high-speed rail across the UK.'
We are therefore enthusiastically working with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed rail to Scotland and thus to bring benefits to everyone and to add to the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with the British Ministers over the next year and the joint decision-making on the next steps.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 on its flights to deposit a hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 for hand luggage and USD 2 for coffee or soda, although they said in their announcement on Wednesday that passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new carry-on baggage fee applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so the small luggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the passengers with the payment are waiting until the gateway.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to charge this fee," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second baggage handles in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and stuffed them into the hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so that space was often lacking in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the purpose of this new fee was not really to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier's most trusted customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not be valid.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can bring in the bag for which he will not pay anything, while the other ticketed queue for the same bag will pay USD 100.
O'Malley said the website and the check-in procedures would be modified to ensure that passengers learned of the fee before they arrived at the gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will not be in force until the summer, but a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
She argues that handling baggage costs money, and passengers who require this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view another baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
But most did not draw on the charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost company, Allegiant Air, later followed its example.
The only company that also has such charges is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport adviser Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the pay for the hand luggage of the company would bring in USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former senior executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and marveled at what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual pay for Spirit's hand luggage.
"The on-air start was the most tilting I've ever seen in my flying career," he said.
I expected to see teeth gnashing and arguing at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the boarding took place in an instant."
Frontier will also apply the fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, to the model of Spirit.
Frontier said that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be replenished for free.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to introduce beverage charges in 2008, but withdrew from it seven months later after complaints from passengers, and no major airline had emulated it.
Frontier's latest move to charge for hand luggage if passengers do not purchase a flight directly from this airline is its last effort to direct customers directly to their website.
Airlines pays online travel dealers such as Orbitz from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than doing so through online travel agencies.
Frontier, however, went furthest in this area.
In September, it started giving to customers who bought a travel agency via an online travel agency for only half a few miles as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for the flown mile to 25 per cent of the journey.
So a trip with Frontier 1,000 miles purchased through an online travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
Customers are also allowed by the company to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly via the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is becoming a whirlwind and losing money.
According to financial results presented Wednesday by company partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity shrank by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
By selling this airline, Republic is also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
We studied 11 TISSFES OF THE INZERTEMS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 job-several advertisements, of which 4300 were published in the daily newspapers and 6800 advertisements (62 per cent) on the internet.
The internet is thus becoming the most important media for publishing job offers.
As recently as 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, his share was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it has stabilised at around 60 per cent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job options in themselves reflects by the current situation on the labour market.
An example is a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published in a period of economic prosperity and a time of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same reporting period, up from less than half in 2012.
The offer of online positions is geared towards a closer, in particular a more skilled group of professions.
By contrast, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including the workers' ones, according to the author of the analysis Pavlína Šťastnová.
The degree of representation of selected professional groups varies from both media outlets.
On the Internet, adverts attracted top spots seeking managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or leading small businesses was only on the internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, while a large representation belongs mainly to the service and working-class professions.
The most frequently cited requirements that employers express by means of an advertising offer are, of course, education.
Other areas surveyed included a knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.
In the daily press, the requirement to know a foreign language was made in three per cent of advertisements, 37 per cent on the internet.
In only two percent of the ads were employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in daily newspapers in 11 percent, on the internet at 57 per cent).
Practice in the industry was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Practice requirements are generally associated with skilled professions.
These are in particular the production leaders and other managers.
For blue-collar professions, it is mainly about mechanics and repairers or producers and processors of food products, or repairers of electrical appliances, added study author Jiří Tillner.
Employers also set out requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential applicants in half of their advertisements.
As the most frequently sought-qually required skills, the advertisement in the first place has long been appearing in communication skills.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, accountability, organisational skills and reliability.
A fifth of shopping centres face low attendance
This is according to data from the real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Business Centre is opening to the public in Bohnice, Prague, and will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are an inadequate-sized center relative to the location and poor layout, i.e. too many floors or a complicated and messy arrangement of passages, or dead places of the centres," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to retail real estate director Jones Lang LaSalle, Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the shopping centres face low attendance.
The main reasons include, among other things, poor transport accessibility, the low income category of local residents or the over-stre due to the market at the site.
Some of the projects opened up almost fully filled, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, customers are a bit conservative and don't like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centres need to do more to 'toule' their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The occupancy of shopping centres is generally stable, according to Soták, and is rising even for some centres as landlords were willing to discount the rent in the crisis and doper to the centre.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully booked and the average occupancy rate is reduced (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
Shopping centres opened in the past two years have been a very slow market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a market place for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
In Prague, for example, we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly scope on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', focused on purchases and daily services for the population living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.
Also, according to Soták, there is a place for other shopping centres on the domestic market.
This is for both small 'service' centres and for major projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extensions in regional cities.
"Culties such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague he sees a space for the upcoming shopping centre on Victory Square, according to him the clear potential of Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square streets.
"The expansion of retail parks is being developed intensively, allowing traders to be covered and expanded to be covered and expanded to smaller cities for favorable rents and operating costs, the space is still in some locations for smaller local or housing shopping centres, respectively their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million sqm of gross, as high as to rail.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from the UK and France, the Czech Republic is trapping by about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Parents of a teenage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of the teenage boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a wilted wrestling spirit in his high school gym, believes their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the town of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th, clad in a straightened ghostly behind the bleachers in the high school gym he was attending to.
The sheriff's investigators from the Lowndes County district concluded that Johnson died accidentally, but the family of the 17-year-old refuses.
"They are unequivocally convinced that their son was murdered," lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents the Kenneth and Jacququelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he'd died the way the sheriff said he'd died.
"They believe it goes against logic, the laws of physics, and also the common sense," Crump said.
They believe it should cover up for what really happened to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he came back in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions had gone unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
said Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for routine investigations," he said.
Moore told the newspaper that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "sovert chug.
However, according to Moore, the second autopsy gave a different cause of death.
"There are a few question marks that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence in the Johnson case to investigate a criminal investigation or civil rights violations, he will ask the FBI and its execution.
A deputy to the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for commenting on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the surveillance camera videos examined by investigators.
The teenage parents hope that the video footage will include a clue leading to the discovery of their son's death.
Report: Obama campaign considered trading Biden for Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest aide secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket.
This revelation is the most important sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times received a copy of the incoming book and announced Thursday evening that the president's senior auspices had held intense group meetings and surveys in late 2011 to estimate whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes of re-election.
According to the Times's national-political correspondent, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the campaign's leaders' efforts to lead officials, and in the White House, namely Bill Daley's former White House office manager, to measure the effect on the election of the move by former Secretary of State Clinton to the vice presidency.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign's infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Just a few of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House White House Advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – were known to consider this change.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket would "not raise Obama's chances substantially."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been researching a whole lot of things in intensity, and this was one of them," he told the Daley.
You mustn't forget that the president had a terrible prospect at the time, so we were like, "Chrpe, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "appropriate care," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had made considerable investment to see if the move would pay for the election.
"Fraisan campaigns don't put that kind of money for elections and qualitative research unless something is really being considered," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering the exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of this potential shuffle of the cards.
While Daley said he didn't think the president was "aware of the potential changes," the office manager admitted that it was "possible" to be known.
Martin added that the book "Double down" does not finally answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he had seriously thought that Obama had not known about research on the bea's bee-taking to remove Biden from the ticket.
"Maybe," Martin said.
No, Mr. Hasek.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not how.
Pressure is to be put in such a need for Martin Hašek to be stripped of all political positions and to leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solutions will reduce the level of political culture, which is already scant.
Martin Hašek is hailed by the promise he made, but everyone and politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and to give great consideration to what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital the politician has (Mr. Babiš also has the tangible one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program championed by the liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he stepping down in politics.
Mr. Hashka, if that's what you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements make me sure you don't, unless you've just lied - here's how difficult it is with the lie), you'll leave politics yourself, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as a statement from the man who made the mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless weakling whose words or actions cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be a proud, albeit flawed, person or a lifelong sket.
It may seem to you that it is unfair to address only you, but you are the leader and they are just misguided sheep.
And you're the leader and you always wanted to be.
I understand that now you're trying to lower your ears for a while, regrouping your strength, sitting out the embarrassment, and then attack again, but that's what the guerrillas or the backstuds behave.
You, I repeat, in your eyes, the leader, the alpha male, are so behave.
Accept responsibility and get out of politics.
The black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find the money to repair the crumbling motorway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that can easily fit into your car's dashboard.
The devices that track every kilometre the motorist drives, and which transmit this information to the authorities, is at the heart of Washington's and state-planning authorities' controversial efforts to renovate an outdated US major road funding system.
The usually bad drean design of highways suddenly made the ups and ups and incurs of a variety of alliances.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these small cabinets to record the miles travelled and perhaps where you were going to – and then using this information to form a tax assessment.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy problems.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to proceed, some states are waiting for nothing.
They are looking at how they can move over the next decade to the system in which the driver pays per kilometre of the road he is travelling on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter of which we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of State Administration, which plans to begin tracking mileage for this state at each California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The impedigor is that the Road Trust Fund, funded by the taxes that Americans pay for at petrol stations, is down.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
Cars will travel far more miles per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of petrol, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by just one cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system of paying for the kilometre travelled.
"In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user charge by the number of kilometres travelled.
It is no surprise that the idea is enjoyed by urban liberals, as taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, which, for example, can help reduce traffic jams and greenhouse gas generation.
California designers look to the system in planning strategies to meet the targets set out in the ambitious Global Warming Laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (representing a member of Pennsylvania), the chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also saw it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market officials at the Reason Foundation are also in favor of the idea that drivers will pay for the miles travelled.
"It's not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, the vice president of strategy at the organization, Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers who encouraged Congress in 2011 to move towards paying per kilometre.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives' leadership rejected the proposal and did so because of concerns from rural legislators representing the constituents of the population, whose daily life often means traveling many miles for work outside the city.
But several states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
The scorliest is Oregon, which has included 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state the tax on the mileage, instead of the tax on petrol.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is researching the project.
Illinois is trying to do so to a limited extent for trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transportation, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
But this concept has no supporters alone.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"Failing concerns about the Big Brother tracking and the sort of thing were a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and traffic management at the non-Ga.
It wasn't something that people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the U.S. Civil Libertarian Union warned on its website on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to build a vast, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to the record of individual daily outings and arrivals.
Nevada is among the several states that are trying to find the available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometres the car will travel, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real distance travelled).
This firm was not originally involved in the action to help the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market for legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they would drive away.
But this device that tests attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only delivers a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded by a modem.
"People will be more willing to go for it unless you're following their speed and their location," says Ryan Morrison, True Mileage's CEO.
Some of these pilot programmes have made a number of major errors.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experimenting with drivers giving the choice.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage travelled by all the residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accept this concept if the device is able to do more, no less.
In the city of New York, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay the extra charges for parking hours, to provide insurance by mileage, and to collect data on the speed of other drivers, so that motorists can avoid traffic.
"Theotorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits they are offered," the city's design document states.
However, some transport planners would like to know whether all discussions about paying per kilometre are just a giant proxy.
Officials at the Metropolitan Transport Committee in San Francisco Bay say Congress could very easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the petrol tax increase.
A one-off or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrids or other cars that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"No radical operation is needed if you can take the aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
What billionaire are you going to phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy O2 operator.
Both firms confirmed the negotiations, and according to a variety of sources from the agencies and from behind the scenes, the hand is already up in the sleeve.
The announcement of the transaction is expected to come in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequencies auction, before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG Group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, it went for the auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, the company's appetite for leaps and communications had not been mentioned.
But Sazka is now led by the highly experienced telecoms maverick Robert Chvátal.
He started out as the marketing chief of Radio and T-Mobile), then became director of T-Mobile, Slovakia, and for the last time he headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She's applied for the auction, and now she's admitted she wants to launch a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds at auction, it will be able to move existing customers to its network from its own virtual operator.
Vodafone might not like that under normal circumstances, but according to Hospodářské noviny, this may be part of the two companies' much closer cooperation.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of rival O2 and T-Mobile operators, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that may be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender for the LTE networks (as a newcomer, it can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not mind the auctioning of only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone can share the networks with Sazka.
Vodafone will release Sazka to its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In between, Sazka will start building a costly LTE network that will also be used by Vodafone.
Satisfied can be both companies.
The money saved could then be spent by Vodafone on a fixed internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of a Czech one) to acquire an immediately full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mogul that's going to be expected to restructure.
In the auction, the LTE networks would have won by Kellner for O2 and, very likely, in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both firms have already declared that they will share networks.
The auction could thus finally end in success, but quite probably not with the high amounts enjoyed by the state budget.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between a call with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giantes.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September over a protest against planned oil drilling in the Arctic have been shipped from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
AFP reported the news today, citing the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
She also claims that the original allegations of her piracy activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women, detained in Russia following a nonviolent action against an oil rig in the Arctic, were transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to DPA, it was a planned move.
Authorities first charged environmentalists with piracy, for which they faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week, they announced that the charge would be replaced by a softer disorderly conduct, which carries a lower sentence with a lower sentence of seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace pointed out in a statement today that the oner of piracy has not yet been dropped by the authorities, as promised.
That means the detainees are now charged with two felonies.
The powerful Committee of Investigation announced last week that it would replace the charges of piracy with charges of disorderly conduct.
But when the 30th of the prisoners were tweaking the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, a new charge was filed against each," AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying in a statement.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at the Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which was flying the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but were dismissed by the court.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of the imprisoned.
According to AFP, the CEO of Greenpeace, Kumi Naidoo, said today that the move to St. Petersburg would facilitate the meeting of the detainees with the families and with consular workers.
But there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They can actually be worse," he cautioned.
The Dutch king Willem-Alexle-Alexander was asked for help by one of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, it urged the monarch to discuss their situation during a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a mobster against police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass the information to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared his drug addiction would come out.
A Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who informed the drug mobster of a major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to be sent sensitive information to the head of the undercourner Neil Scarbrough after becoming a suspect in cocaine use, to the head of the underworld, about his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was hailed by the criminals as the best attorney, was arrested at home in his home after police surveillance by Scarborough, whom he represented in previous narcotics proceedings.
Officers saw Sarborough (32) leave three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, which had just been at dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on tests to find traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of A-Class drugs.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to get information on the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being tracked at the time as part of a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police seized heroin and cocaine worth about £1.5 million in cash during a series of raids, police arrested heroin and cocaine, with a further 32 people in prison.
Ditta (42) passed information to criminals for fear of his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at the Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors, was in a shameful time before the Liverpool Crown Court when, after a three-week trial, he was found guilty of defending justice in two cases.
During an earlier hearing, he pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's downfall came after a police investigation by Scarborougha found that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and spotted him placing drugs about the cleanliness of 60 percent under the lawyer's black golf basket.
Subsequently, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers Stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home to find the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
The court heard that traces of the A-grade drug were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, and said he had spoken to the suspect's dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell under "trustworthy communication."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
During the police interview, he said that he ran an office at both his home address and at the workplace, and that clients had visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he had contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Whoever else is more aware that he must not violate the law other than the criminal prosecutor."
Mr. Ditta is charged with abusing his position as an attorney and of getting in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about the drug dealer, it's about the drug dealer who's supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession; he disgraced it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially with Scarboroughem, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta dismissed the offence and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer I am not, and I would like to give the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have expected 15 hours, but I would have done so immediately."
However, after the hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said, "Mr. Ditta, from the criminal attorney in the criminal field, he himself became a criminal as he began to obtain drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organized crime groups, which tasked him with gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
Attorneys must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and are to inspire confidence and the public feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire has conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now for obstructing the administration of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring the criminal to justice.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law's hands.
We'll find you and take you to our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of collies to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in the trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner he would like Mohammed Ali to be and to make inequality a motivation for the job.
Obama backs off health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama backed away from hist-trooning and ambitious promise yesterday that "if you like your health program, you can keep it."
Citing hundreds of thousands of reports of testimony from providers, Republicans have accused the president of delemiled the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama flinched from his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In view of what he called a "dishancer in the media" about the testimonies, Obama called on the Americans who received these notifications to search for new safeguards in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not come as a surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchased the insurance itself can be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements given by the Affordable Care Act.
"I'm telling these Americans to this: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her testimony to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet market had been "inwort" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'll try to win back your trust.
The irritated Sebelius ralley, who was picked up by the microphone on, spoke yesterday in the direction of the counselor sitting behind her at the Committee's meeting yesterday, which took place after a fierce exchange with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri about whether she, too, had to join the Obama care program herself.
For more than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly pressed the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up on the government-sponsored insurance, and did not forbite the program through HealthCare.gov, which is now imposing on millions of Americans.
Wandering through mud, river and jungle, providing free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 female Topic candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes Award, you can vote for him or any other of the top ten of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Cameroon's capital, Yaounde.
At first he was treated with only a broken arm, but subsequently developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he created a hematoma that caused problems for him all his life.
"There weren't any neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside of Cameroon if we had the money to do it.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at 5:00 in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first one.
There are many patients.
Some people only die because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died, things have not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per population.
And even if the doctors could be visited by the Cameroonis, many would not be able to afford it.
Two of the country's five people live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's healthcare spending is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
With poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a vascular surgeon physician at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas over the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped his group of volunteers with nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are packed in vans, attach medical supplies to the roofs, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles must push through the river and the mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: a feast, a singing and a dance, and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
In these villages, the free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle - with his broad smile and unbridled energy - is very willing to engage in the local merriment.
The next day the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition," Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a 60-kilometer radius, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sex-borne diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate – a documentary requested by the school, but which many miserable families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team does simple surgeries under local anaesthetic.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, at the town hall or at home; after the surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery place to make way for the next patient.
Using the light from the generator, the operating room and the sanitary equipment of Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but the village musicians usually help the team not to lose their motivation.
"To stay awake and keep working, they play drums all night," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed free free of charge last year, and realises that their help can mean a lot to local residents.
One man said he would be able to work again after the hernia surgery.
"That will change our family's future," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for the private health clinics around Yaounde.
He says it is this second job that funds about 60% of his nonprofit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is in her second year of meditology at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteers for Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital or he's always trying to raise money for the organization to do those campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We were washing our hands thoroughly for D.Bwelle, and to remove the blood spots or to hold his instruments," says O'Malley.
As a second-year medical student in America, you'll never experience that.
Students volunteers usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But as soon as they reach Yaounde, food, transport, and their studies are provided by Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the constant struggle is not a burden.
To help others live happily, to fulfill the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," says Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
A laughing person, alleviating their pain -- that's why I'm doing it.

Central banks to keep swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need.
The banks said so in their joint statement.
"This is a very sensible step," commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays, a London bank.
"So far, all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is not surprising in my opinion," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are reinforcing the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first faltered.
Central bank agreements have allowed access to euros, dollars, and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
Central bankers' decisions come at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its program of supporting the US economy, which could drive the price of money even higher in the global market.
By default, the swap contract is used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency, with the current excess liquidity of the other currency.
It can be seen as a deposit of one currency and a loan of currency to another.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to return confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed to bank supervision, while the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
Number of HIV infections exceeds 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic the number of infections grows every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and by 2010 there were 180 of them.
Last year, there were 212 infections and a record number.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I don't think there is any doubt," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who ran the Prague House of Light for Patients for for years.
According to him, 165 HIV patients were added in the country last year from January to September, with 176 over the same period this year.
From the beginning of the surveillance until the end of this September, the tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 infected residents.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian and 116 from Ústí nad Labem.
The fewest infeathe in the Highlands, there were 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with a blood transfusion in the past.
Such a case, however, has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, and he transferred to them from his mother.
Children should be taught to myths and legends as "models for a way of life," says the author.
The Taesses of Thor may show that "the coarse force cannot be equal to clever cunches," while the arthis legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Much of myths would be "too wild for teaching at school, far too scandalous and, in some cases, too obscene," said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of works of the appropriate age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk creations are already part of education," he said.
I have defended this plan for 20 years.
He added that the "openly instructive" authors and teachers are a "substitute" message for children in an engaging story with a "swig" message for children.
The Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and British National Tory, says: "You may have good intentions, but you will do better to keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end with a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly established.
The old truth about showing off than to describe it.
Miloslava Cejpková: November's smile
It came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not used to.
First she put her smile down, the one she was still showing off as a defense against the would-be friendly surroundings.
That made her very relieved, because it was a mask she chose not to be put off in public.
He was only honest at home on the days when she grandmothered and had grandchildren Elinka or Achin.
And, of course, when her sons phoned her.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless course of business skills.
Now they were really good at it.
So she doesn't grieel her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a masquerade.
November, or any other moon, can't do the miracle to smile really, like they did when they were on a trip with the one who hasn't been around for almost three years.
Pierre Rainera: I try to make Cartier's style evolve like a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time guide our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier, explains in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
GM pulls down some new light trucks in the US to repair seat backrests
According to a Friday notice from the U.S. Automotive Safety Authority, General Motors is withdrawing nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to repair the fault with the manual tilting backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the front seat tilts mechanism may be a fault.
As a result, the backs of the seats are not in accordance with the federal standards of automotive safety for headrests.
A notice posted on the website of the StateSec of Transport Safety on the Road (NHTSA) says that "if the car gets a crash from behind, the headrest may not be properly protected by the passenger, which increases the risk of injury."
The downloaded models were made between 1 August and September 10.
GM launched the shipment to the market in June and is the most important launch of the vehicle for this leading US automaker, from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery owner of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the announcement to the owners because of the government's 16-day dysfunction, which weakened the growth in car sales in October.
Sales of deliveries of the Silverado and Sierra, which were revised for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Too inquisitive newspaper to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on its front page asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
New Express newspaper, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public petition for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to make up stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said the New Express newspaper would now make a "full correction."
The "replade" was published by the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
A preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 to August 2013, New Express newspaper from the Yangcheng group Evening News had published several false reports about the company Zoomlion.
"The editor-in-itist of the New Express newspaper was disorderly," the administrator said in his statement.
He said he had to decide to "save Chen Yongzhou's administrative punishment in the form of the cancellation of the journalistic license."
He also "arrested the Yangcheng group Evening News to carry out an overall correction to the New Express and recommend that the relevant responsible persons be examined in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express paper."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express on financial irregularities in a company with a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page, claiming he was behind his journalist's work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted to making false stories for a fee.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust," he told the state news broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was covering for money and fame.
I realize I acted badly.
After Mr. Chen's apology to Mr. Chen's apology on the front page, stating that he had failed to do so by failing to check his reports.
Recently, several high-profile suspects have been filing a confession on television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly forced, notwithstanding the change in this year's law, which prohibits authorities from forcing authorities to accuse themselves.
With growing poverty of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
At a pawnshop in Bendemeer's shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's tuition.
"My husband and I just bought a house with me and I gave all my money," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 (SGD) every month as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across Southeast Asia areas – where household debt is increasing – is such that ValueMax, where the woman is making her transaction, became the third pawnshop on the list in Singapore this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash - the SGD 1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga - but it is also almost as cheap as insecure bank loans.
The Singapore-call pawns routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, paestal booners have the advantage of not requiring verification of the person (a history) or proof of income, and they can provide a loan more quickly than banks.
And so, as families feel pressure about the rising cost of living and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit backed by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households, mainly because of the increasing rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in view of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with an 80%-per-center GDP increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about the high level of consumption debt in Thailand, which this week barely came out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with increasing costs, people from the high to the low [revenue scale] will try to replenish their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia's CIMB Bank.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to people hastily stopping their personal assets and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewellery for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped at 200 city pawnshops are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's golden necklace and get it back next month.
The largest pawnstron operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
Growth in the pawnbending sector is so large that ValueMax, the operator of a branch in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax Executive Director Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the 66 million it acquired on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount creditors have come under fire from criticism over high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the pledge offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but it also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers are stopping items they already own and the monetising of personal property does not increase the household debt," he says.
In the company, the pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, among those who use the pawnshops, it is not just people in financial distress.
Wealthouse people from Singapore also use the ValueMax branches when they stop the Rolex's gold rods or watches, allowing them to reach 60 percent of their purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all sorts of backgrounds.
"They are the rank rich individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of their bold shops or investments, or small businesses that need help to solve the problems in their cash flow," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as fast as they can.
The NSA website's downfall is not blamed by hackers but by the "internal flaw"
The Mysterious National Security Agency reported last Friday that its website crashed for several hours last week due to an internal error, not because of an attack by hackers, as some claimed online.
"The NSA.gov sender was not available for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be eliminated during the evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by the DDoS (distributed refusal) is not true.
Previously, this evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA's website had not worked for at least six hours, and the site was no longer available to some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the internal sensitive networks of the agency had not been "at risk" at all.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of online hacking activists claimed to be responsible for dismantleing the NSA's website through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are in the consecutive and the site is missed.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple, and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA's superterious agency, which once won the nickname No Such Agency, has become the focus of public attention in recent months after a string of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs, and the target of a biting critique of the product of the NSA's theft of secret NSA files from the agency and their disclosure by the disilluted former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Number of HIV infected in Prague exceeds 1,000
Doctors in Prague have registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the 1986 monitoring to the end of this year's third quarter, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to statistics from the national reference laboratory for the AIDS of the State Institute of Health.
According to her, there have been 2,063 infections throughout the Czech Republic so far.
In 396 immune deficiency disease has already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new contagments and in 2010 it revealed 180.
The number dropped to 153 the year before last, but it was a record last year.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200 is no longer in doubt," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who ran the Prague House of Lights for Patients for for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the outbreak in 39 people and 47 last year, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS disease has erupted in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of this country: Presidents on the brink of power
It is almost a rule that, at key moments in the country, the head of state was not in the form of being able to meet his statesmanic duties.
If T. Masaryk had been physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidential term, and the events surrounding Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the War, but after a symbolic resistance, the air force could fly across the border, the heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not struggle to fight laboriously for its legitimacy there.
Above all, the nation would not have a hangover from that surrender to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and was still in shape for Munich, but it started to go downhill with him during the war and behaved accordingly in February 48.
To be a little better, he could go into exile for the third time and undermin the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hách.
They elected him, saying that "the president will not get into a situation for him to make decisions."
But he had to, though the big decision with a knife at Hitler's neck in the chancellery probably wasn't there.
The head of intelligence, František Moravec, until the last days of March 1939 said what should be done, so that the occupation, which he knew about for the day accurately, did not go so smoothly and with such a profit for the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, both did not believe him, and were afraid.
The human wreckage, Gottwald, had his age-old fellow-comrades executed, as Moscow had told him.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitively barred by his share of normalisation and they had to depose him, already completely senile.
That Husák was helpless and the sick depressed old man made things easier in November 89, but that is the only positive.
Havel was lucky not to have met him in office in the last few years, the worst he was spared.
Klaus may still be a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Now here's this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks like and we don't know all about that yet.
Fortunately, there is no threat to the Republic external at risk now.
Or maybe it's threatening, just not being seen.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is (from a historical point of view) well that the president is not quite strong.
But it is not a normal state.
Couldn't we elect a president in this country once again someone admitably of the thinking and acceptably healthy?

Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
TOP 09 President Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the last one interviewed by Aktuálně.cz, he said there was no other way out, and every government resulting from the vote last Friday and Saturday was an impossible patchwork.
"It can't last long," Karel Schwarzenberg said, estimating the lifespan of the lifetold to two years.
He disagrees with the objection that voters will hardly choose in a very different way next time, "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the TOP 09 president does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as it did this year (it lost about 300,000 votes compared to 2010.
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that there will be an early election, it will strengthen the ANO 2011 movement of Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will be losing.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where the chairman, Bohuslav Sobotka, said after a secret meeting of the party leadership in the party leadership that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of the Social Democracy, Schwarzenberg comments in his own:
"Heading for the leaders of the democratic party as little boys go to the head of state to allow them to take a coup in the party."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and more intelligent."
"Because I have never seen something so eagerly performed badly in my life," added the TOP 09 chairman.
And in the direction of President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the battle for the presidency) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take the party's seize."
The first laws have already been introduced by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the House, including the Farsky Register of Treaties, which was discussed by the House committees before the election, but fell under the table with early elections.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the TOP 09 president argues that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed."
At the same time, however, TOP 09 apparently wants to overt out overt out similar attempts from other parties.
For example, ANO election leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 in the election fight that the idea of introducing a register of treaties "craw" the ANO program.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply dusted off a proposal that was poised for a second House reading.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check out the tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used the methods of "taking into the phone, watching and confronting" to confirm a scam tip for a love affair that was to involve then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
U.S. Attorney Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey in court that the News of the World newspaper had been caught by fake news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special counselor" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and break into her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson had called her, too, and was leaving her with voice messages.
"The prosecutor is suggesting that Mr. Coulson, who is now NotW's editor, is not the man in front of the house, hoping to catch people out there, but a man who likes to give people stories to see what they say," said Mr Edis.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He clearly knows about the other one, the surveillance, he must know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "Oh, of course he knows."
The rumor of the love affair that Clarke is involved was first captured by the NotW newswarking department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, "You're just wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions, was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found the records on the private investigator's computer, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects."
During the time Ms. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief correspondent Neville Thurlbeck and former correspondent James Weatherup were overseeing the monitoring of Ms Pawlby's movements.
Coulson left her a voice-on message on June 18, 2005, telling her, "I got a story we're about to publish tomorrow, and I'd love to talk about with Charles."
Mr Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same model as other prominent figures, including former Interior Secretary David Blunkett.
The court heard in court on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett for his love affair with a married woman, while he himself was seeing co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied collusion with other people to hack into the phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the Comedy Festival of New York: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the place where a solo comic performance was born in America: almost a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the people of the jokes using the interview method.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the solo comedy Carolines, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and major theatres.
'Most of these titles appeared in the Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to be played at the club,' Hirsch said.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes" as well as "Stand Up for Heroes), an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has expanded, the world of comedy has expanded.
Several comedians attending this year's festival came from non-traditional channels such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has emerged with his sitcom (the cheerle-spicy "League" on the FXX's fantastic-troofball theme) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation" program, but was most famous for her fast-spreading series of videos, "Marcel the shell with shoes on).
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with clearly recognisable voices (surrenderly pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the sarcastic, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will speak to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg" on TV.
The meeting is held at Town Hall in the centre of Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he walks down the aisle sometimes between two buildings and he's like, man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Many things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that one could agree with it, whereas Chairman Štěch was stirring up a discus discommerent.
The commissioner, Chovanec, was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau and confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed off their weaknesses in the main.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and useless, with Vice-President Zaoralek making it the most impossible to interview on television.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better option than for the ČSSD to nominate the Vice-President of the Senate, Gajdůšková, the only one who would not have had an initial handicap and I think she would perform at a standard.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support him.
I would add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and to proceed without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with a mere blessing from President Babiš and without the Peoples, but with the People's Minister of Health, Hovorka, who is actually a religious social democrat.
This mini-government would have great stability because it would enforce the proper referendum law and so pledged to support the chairman of the Dawn, Okamura.
In the end, President Babiš would accept the progression of the tax, as he is bright and see that it cannot be done without her.
The Peoples would not bring problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not be in the government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, and there would be a valuable minister, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but they will provide support, they will also provide well.
Let's give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
Bárta's detention is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is he behind the leak of wiretaps?
The chairman of Public Affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Along with him, the head of the Department of Analytics and Informatics of the Anti-corruption Police, Jan Petržílek, was detained.
The detention is linked to wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the wiretaps, which was reported by Novinky.cz, was confirmed by a trusted Czech Press Agency.
The intercepted phone calls by Janoušek and Bém published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which the two men address each other's "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík," show Janoušek's influence on the actions of the city under Bém's leadership.
The Journal reported that they were acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, from which they were leaked to the ABL security agency two years later.
It was then owned by Barta.
News.cz reported that the detained criminologist Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which was subsequently involved in the interception, at the same time they were made public.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
He and Vít Bárta also detained an anti-corruption police officer
Bart's defense attorney, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption by VV deputies, did not want to comment too much on the case either, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter as well, but I cannot comment further, given the protection of classified information."
According to Právo, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS).
The news server tn.cz reported that Bárta could have been buying classified information from the police.
According to the server, according to news server first, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the post of Barta he allegedly sought.
But the Law's latest information shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is unrelated to Petr Lessy.
Police Presidium spokeswoman Eva Kropáčová declined to comment, saying that the case was being dealt with by the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, told Právo on Friday.
It is the prosecutor there that is to supervise Bart's case, and therefore, from her words, it is implicitly apparent that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under secrecy.
The reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta, Kateřina Klasnová, in front of their residence in Prague's Klárov district.
She was loading her suitcases into her car and leaving.
She declined to comment on the incident.
On Friday morning, Dawn's leader, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bart's detention.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of many candidates of many parties on our ticket, and as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not even a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy movement in the House of Representatives in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case of bribing Public Affairs MPs.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months, suspended for 30 months.
Eventually the sentence was changed and Barta was acquitted.
Concerns about Mozambique's security escalate over strong personality conflict
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founding president of the Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to call out peace slogans at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, the investment company's executive director.
Fearing for the future of her country, she traded her company garb for a T-shirt decorated with the words "we're requesting safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, news of the conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party came almost daily, one of the worst scuffle since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then the government of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that an open conflict will erupt again in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
A fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discoveries of large-scale coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest may bring more than $50 billion worth of investment in investment worth more than $50 billion over the next few years, such as Rio Tinto and Vale, Brazil's Brazilian Eni and American Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have accused each other of the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the government sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional Renamo Party stronghold on September 17.
The violent attack of the former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afons Dhlakama, the group's leader, the party's spokesman, Renamo Fernando Mazanga, told the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of triggering conflicts because it is said to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to alleviate his fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told the French press office AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "loss" who wanted to use "anything left of his strength to try to prove that he could order the government to make his own decisions."
Both Frelimo or Renamo claim to avoid war.
But fears increased when Mr. Mazanga's words were quoted that the Renamo party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the deal.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease the tensions between these parties, fueled by a series of scuffles this year.
It is a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought to make the election changes, has already commented that it would boycott the local elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the dying movement to gain benefits and financial proceeds from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Mozambique (DHM) movement, which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, will improve its position in the elections, as expected.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza – who is out of his second term next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a democratic system of multiple parties, he doesn't want a transparent election, he doesn't want to make peace because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but carried out divisive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between the north and south.
Most of the scuffles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres away from Maputo's capital, but where is the city of Beira, a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on for its export of coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad for about a week when the Renamo side threatened to attack the route.
Mr Mazanga would not comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "call the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased its frustration in the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also worried about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of abduction.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country rests exclusively with the government and the president, and that he is to be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Demonstrant Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"None cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Tripodi denies Obeid influencing it
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be under investigation by the State's Corruption Supervisory Committee.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied that he was changing the coastal leasing policy at the request of his political advisor, Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday extended its search to see if Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to renew his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café, without having to take part in the tender after his expiration in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's clandestine interests in these properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
Over the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to tender.
The toers were against this and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of the ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a fan of the tenders.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, had urged a shift in the government's rental policy.
The transcript of the calls submitted to the ICAC showed the calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr. Tripodim and Steve Dunne, the lead official who had come to the port resort after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was he the subject of interviews during these phone calls the development of the commercial leases policy?" said aid commissioner Anthony Wheala to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but certainly not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
RIGHT, 1 November 2013
Dog summarized the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on crutches
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left the Motol Hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the Lány Castle.
What kind of health is he in?
Cabbage bubbles in Kunovice, they don't add chemistry to it
More than 1,000 tonnes of sauerkraut are to be produced in the coming months in Slovácké Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and will last about six months.
He has produced a healthy delicacy here since 1925 in the traditional way, i.e. pedaling directly in the big dances.
In modern industrial times, it is a rarity.
Our female workers tread a nearly ten-kilometre shift route.
Each of the ten tanks can accommodate fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," said the race director of Slovácká Fruta, David Kladroba.
The cabbage musshrees are brought to the company's premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsk and Břeclavsk.
The Fruta staff then cleans the vegetables, remove the broon, and throws a ring into the ring.
From there, the already sliced cabbage falls into pools of six-metre depths, where the pedalers are tirelessly working in white clothing and boots.
This oims out unwanted air.
The last trampled layer of cabbage is covered with a tarp and loaded with water.
"The clear twist is then aged for six to eight weeks for spontaneous lactic fermentation without any addition of fermentation substances," the director of Kladroba stressed.
The natural process corresponds to production in home conditions, with individual layers siping with salt and cumin.
The cabbage after the fermentation travels to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet and sour brine for slogans or glasses and subjected to sterilisation.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut to the domestic and Slovak markets.
He is also in interest in it in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Damkova is said to be banning UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the referees' committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing the penalties for the judges.
She is forbidden by UEFA rules, as she said in an interview with the daily newspaper Právo.
Otherwise, he said, FAČR would face penalties.
Damkova also denied siding in her role for the Pilsen footballers where she came from.
This speculation is really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example, from Prague.
So in the case of the vote I can lose 1:6," Damkova said in response to the criticism that has been bolt up after Plzeň has recently played twice as much penalties as the other league teams.
Thus, although the FACR has stopped publishing penalties for referees in recent months, Damkova assures that the referees are paying the price for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the board finds out that the referee made a mistake, they will restrict his delegation, whatever the match," Damk said.
The reason why the penalties are not disclosed is, according to Damk, a ban from the European Football Union.
"The FA ban the publication of such information and punishes the breach harshly."
"We're very covorch and looking for something behind every mistake."
"We made the restrictions public, but I received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop doing this, there will be harsh sanctions," Damk said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If the disclosure continued, the commission would lose UEFA's money to educate and develop referees.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program to educate the referees," Damkova added.
Does the internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit forecast and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base pre-tax profit to be between $325 and 340 million, up from USD 305 to 315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17% increase in the 2011-12 record profit of $290 million.
CEO Graham Turner said the Flight Centre made an 8% profit in the first half of the year and began a sharp rise in the second half of the year, mainly in Australian and British business travel.
"To date, our 10 countries are profitable, and several are heading for a record annual profit before interest and tax," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our greatest creators of profit.
Business with recreational activities rallied during the second half of the year in Australia, offsetting the slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
The US trade has recovered after a loss during the weaker semester and is expected to make its third full-year profit in a row.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
British police deliver extradition notice to Assange
British police today delivered a call for extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had delivered a "tubwnote" to the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to come to the police station and that if he did not, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange, under a British law, exhausted his options when the Supreme Court this month overturned his appeal against extradition, facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sex crimes.
As he feared that he would have taken him to the US, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, seeking asylum for the South American country.
Scotland Yard "refined the extradition notice to the 40-year-old man he is asking to appear at the police station on the day and hour that was addressed to him," the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate the bail conditions.
The embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage because he has released 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The Supreme Court ruled: Nečas can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas could also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the dissolved of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity that applies to speeches in the House.
On the contrary, in the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Marko Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, he decided that they could not be punished for possible offences until they gave up their parliamentary mandate last November, said Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
The court's decision rejected the motion of the public prosecutor, Iva Izzard, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the MPs.
They, he said, accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for resurrection and not cause problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can be prosecuted.
Aircraft manufacturers argue over seat width, big orders are at stake
There was a dispute between the aircraft's lead manufacturers over the width of seats in the second-class for long-haul flights, which this month gave the cause of the bitter exchange of views at the Dubai Air Show.
The issue is the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that airlines would usually be preceded by, but whose assigned space is the key to the demands for efficiency on the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industrial standards to offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but US-based rival Boeing says airlines are to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales with the largest version of its twin-enveol long-range aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear of the aircraft is distributed – especially whether it is sidewarming 9 or 10 seats - is the basis for economic performance claims for proposals for new minic-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the improved "777X" will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out by 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
He recently tentatively showed what the start of a new advertising war may be when he showed financiers a picture depicting three people in a restaurant with the headline "Would you like to be hiring?"
"Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats that are in regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
As the eating habits change, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air travel, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent by the turn of the century, according to data from the US Department of Health.
According to American health statistics, the average American has a 100 cm waist in the 21st century.
Airbus claims that its rival sticks to the 1950s seat concept, when the average seat width of the newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research suggesting that the seating extension by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus' seat dimensions and says it is not within the competence of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export charges and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
"It really is about giving the airlines flexibility and enabling them to do things they believe they have to make to be successful," said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
More space for elbows is essential for passengers, but it is a growing problem for suppliers that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute is a plant in aircraft orders with an estimated deal worth at least $700 billion in the next decades at catalogue prices, enough to defy the scales of US and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to be 20 per cent better efficient for their latest designs for the twin-enorary long-range aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
Boeing's performance demands depend in part on a comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in the row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seedle concept.
"The reason Boeing does this is to foment more seats and make its planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, Airbus's Europe-led passenger comfort.
On the other hand, analysts say that the 10-seat cabins in the row for the existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for denser distribution, which can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"The four-five-centimetre seat-wide would be great for the passengers, but the reality is that from Airbus's business point of view, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777," said the cabin interior expert, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers to airlines to make their choice.
The travelled aircraft dealers even carry with them a measuring band to check the competing layout.
While I boast convenience, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a highly dense layout for low-cost and regional travellers.
The Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin modification by offering wider seats in the aisles on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard, but it may deter the waves of 777X sales.
CME is looking for the TV business.
They release almost a quarter of the people.
Media group CME will be making redundit.
By the end of the year, he wants to sliin about a thousand people.
He intends to cut all the alew activities and only wants to focus on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CME, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs some 650 people, and what it will mean for the domestic TV's number one TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really cannot comment," said Josef Koukolíček, director of communications for Nova.
According to MF DNES, significant layoffs of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should have on the staffing status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new Nova bosses Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined long-time director Adrian Sarbu, talked during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday about wanting to cut back on all activities that were not immediately related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities in particular.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of the defunct company Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, to the company it had forrequireed at the Northel bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, which bought Nortel's $4.5 billion patents, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. Circuit District Court in Texas for infringing the patent.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps combine terms searched online with the relevant advertising, the lawsuit, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available for reach.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that operate on the Google Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a starting price offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times, eventually offering up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the fight for Nortel's patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by Motorola's patents.
"Despite the failure of the attempt to auction the patents at issue, Google has violated and continues to violate the patents," the lawsuit reads.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation for damages from Google because, in its view, Google's patent is being infringed intentionally, as the lawsuit alleges.
George Kerevan: Dated Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that a condition for the independence of Scotland's independence in the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to the stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the newspaper Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as expected – this was not passed into the headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws to suit them.
With Scotland not being in Schengen now, the offer of continued mismatch would be a cheap retreat for Brussels for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old that it became a dug in. I heard the journalist's duck that "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is one interesting thought in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why trade the London yoken for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a real European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
As a crisis of the euro, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, a party dedicated to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency is gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came as if from nowhere, and already in the federal election in September, it has already sifting almost five million votes, effectively "swept out" by the Bundestag to the Free Democrats (the British Liberal Democrats' equivalence).
There has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The economics dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the straitjacket put on the national economies through cing to the common currency, led many people to think that the Europe project had gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a high budget deficit – only true for Greece.
Rather, it is a euro-chaued system that blocks its members at exchange rates advantageous for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only aid is to cut revenue and public spending – which is prompted by Germany.
Behind the current problems with the budget and the currency is the deeper cause of Europe's languor in the performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels - a code to support French and German firms at consumer expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol as is the case in the United States.
This is a paralyse disadvantage in the cost area, as we have already seen in the Grangemouth case.
Nor would any pay freeze in the world undoing the duplicate of Europe's petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a dinging-out rebellion, especially in France, once-enthastred supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that Germany would rein in and allow Paris to stand up to the level of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a card of political legitimacy, and has pushed through its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won major additional elections and relegated the ruling Socialists to third place.
The queue is now, with 24% of the vote, the most popular party in France – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that the fission of the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen handle her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use next year's European elections to create an anti-European anti-creaner anti-creaner across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc may dominate the European Parliament for the first time in the history.
It occurs to me that in the foreseeable future, a growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will come together and the euro will be wiped out.
The EU will not disappear, but will be transformed into something more looser in the sense of the "Europe (sovereign) nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will re-restate their own keranus.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and cling to the United States.
But Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic chill.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area of (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when to let us be.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed order of Europe, provided it retained its own currency.
Working with other like-minded countries would be simpler in the unfederal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP's government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement that does not advocate austerity measures in Europe, which was won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to an opposition stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now chose independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Parents of intersex children can choose the 'non-curdic sex'
Germany became the first European nation to recognise the third gender in children born with ambiguous sex tract.
Newborn children will no longer be ranked only with either the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any sexes for such children, and allows them to list their gender on their birth foliage as "uncursed" or "unspecified."
The law aims to stop pressuring parents to make a hasty decision for a sex-reconstation in their child's sex and to fight discrimination against intersexual ones.
An intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain with the poster formed by the doctors, bruised and scarled.
It is estimated that every year, of the 2,000 children, one born that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, the umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, the glands of the glands (vajepe(s) or the testicles of unusually developed genitals.
The intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to identify the sex, it is better to use the best available information to determine it instead of waiting and to monitor the child's psychological and physical development until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-specific problems, said the new German law "creshears as a good thing."
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening state that requires surgery, but it's not the case with most children," he said.
Gender identification can be performed without surgery and then can wait to see how the identity develops.
The knowledge of the child's sexual affiliation is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery as to why some people are gay.
The report transmitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexuals as being different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender, but to their biological structure, which is neither male nor female, but typically composed with both, and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and character, in the primary sexual characteristics such as the reproduction organs and the sex tract, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transsexual people in the work field, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't answer to any sex now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to label the male, female or "third sex" in official documents.
In June, Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexless" person by winning a court appeal to retain the status of "non-curdic" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, in addition to M (the man) and F (f) the third designation, X, for intersex people, the German passports will have as well as the men) and F (female).
In neighbouring France, according to the France 24 news report, the gender issue is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this fiercely Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "sex theory" from the school textbooks.
American website Catholic online also defined themselves against German law and wrote, "With the way the world is dragged to a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we will turn two more pillars into the civilization."
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see her children be assigned a gender at birth.
"Paradressing itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she told the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female gender were called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome Greek, who had a dual sex.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that gender was something like a blackboard that could be erased and redraw again.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of the operation, saying that sexual affiliation is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong choice because they don't know how, given their gender, children will feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you weren't calling for a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with an ambiguous gender was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender was pacisant.
He created a new concept of "sex affiliation" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment - how the parents raised their child - affected children's genes and hormones and formed a child, regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in a case in 1966, known as "John/Joan," his theory became questionable.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged because of a mismanic, to have their child completely dismembered, removed his testicles and raised to him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he allowed himself to be operated back on to the boy and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors still use the "this model" to this day.
But in the '90s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations appeared "disgruntled with the result."
It was also the case for Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex tract.
Doctors weren't sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfying life."
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's exterior organs and testicles were surgically removed and brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent for a sculpture of the sheath.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
I was sterilized after I was born, and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to the body to make a proper development of his sex tract.
After learning the truth, he changed back to the man, took the testosterone dose and had his breasts removed,
The surger form caused his infertility.
Today, he represents another in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the law group Advocates information for choice, based in California, fears that the German law "calls for branding and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will make it to encourage parents to make quick decisions and to choose 'unorcates' for the child," she said.
We're afraid it's going to encourage intervention.
We believe it is better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will end up being, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be classified as a third gender."
"The adult should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid sex," she said.
German law is about to be awarded at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not sedinel at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest-alater from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would "give the powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are faulty, Katie's female features have developed.
He's got a vagina, but he's got no uterus and ovaries.
She is now married to 29-year-old Katie and works as a child psychiatrist as a children's psychiatric traineeship as a university of his studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some space not to rush to their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to run certain tests and change their minds and gives them time to write "man" or "woman."
In this respect, everything is fine - you raise your child and love it.
You have an amazing child and rejoice in it.
You don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
"It brings the opportunity to involve the child in the decision-making decision-making and taking away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child decides which sex he or she identifies with more - and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The bird was airlifted from the North Sea drilling platform and released back into nature
The bird was flown to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One of the churches was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue centre before it was treated until it recovered.
Colin Seddon said, "This chorus was probably migrating from northern Europe when a strong wind caught it over the North Sea."
Apparently, he was out of power and sanctuary on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added, "He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted for help."
By the time the crane was released, he was in good shape and well.
Znojmo begins with stadium reconstruction
The reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo at the beginning of November.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders to carry out a renovation of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the Znojmo Municipal Stadium is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Together with several others, the testament to the volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník is recent (from a geological point of view).
The last eruptions were still at the beginning of the Quaternary.
Viewed from a greater distance, at the top of Uhlířský vrch is a striking white-clapped Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of the Auxiliary, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church was not preserved.
Shortly after the completion of the church, the avenue was planted from four rows of lime trees, about 1 km long.
The cross road on Uhlířský vrch is the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
At the fifteen stops are wooden sculptures made by the local art carver František Nedomlel.
He used various tree species from the Low Jesenik region.
Similarly, the pedestrians from the rock area form an interesting geological exposition.
Each stop also shows the name of the sponsor.
The Coal Hill is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the readings from the radiometric measurements of old age are somewhat different, the last eruption was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudný (old age 3,3 million) and older than Venusha's volcano (shests 0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born in an explosion.
In it, she eighed out a significant amount of volcanic ash, along with fragments of rock from the bedrock, which were fired by red-brown.
At the end of this phase, the lava leaked to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 metres powerful.
The second eruption ectrined red, brownish-red and, in places, black tufa.
Their layer is mightily up to 50 metres and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tuffs, there are striking volcanic bombs of up to 1 metre in size. The second eruption was also topped with a lava.
At the end of the activity, the volcano was poled out of the volcano by lava, which today forms up to 50 m of a powerful layer of slag-like basalt.
The volcanoes, which alternate between the eelling of the volcanic ash with the lava outcropping, are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually made up of layers, they were given the name of the stratovulan.
The original volcanic cone was gradually being erosioned.
However, it was only threatened by the mining of rock in the quarry on the south side.
The most intense mining took place here in 1953 - 1962.
Tuff were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Mining was halted under pressure from experts and the public to maintain this unique place.
The problem, however, is the porosity and small coherence of rock, which quickly weathers, disintegrate and sown down the slope.
The quarry is disappearing quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-roan slope is the ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The preparation is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
The Uhlířský vrch can be reached by the green tourist sign from Bruntál, or from Silesian Kočov.
Automobilists can use an unpaid parking lot at the start of the lime alley, where the short nature trail begins.
A drunk doused the house with gasoline: He threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
Tensions were rising, fear escalating.
The man threatened to set the house on fire.
All available police patrols in the area therefore went to the scene, as did the unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire brigade.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene, trying to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
A SWAT team had to enter the house, disarming the man and handcuffing him.
The aggressor then ended up for examination at the Mladá Boleslav hospital, from where he was taken to an alcohol-free detention centre.
Firefighters eventually covered the house with gasoline with a sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to the people, all pets were also rescued from the house.
The man did not take to the police negotiator, so the commandos went to him.
The anger at the verdict handed down over the Bali bombing curriculum
Surviving and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 responded in a verdict passed over the last of the outlaws faced with justice and said that Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for compiling explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of a mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other counts of terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, even though it could have insisted that the man with the nickname "Demolition man" (the bunar) be given the death penalty thanks to his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision rekindled the painful memories of June Corteen, the mother of Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastating attack launched by Pateko and other outlet nearly a decade earlier.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should be in the footsteps of the others.
To the AAP, Mrs. Corteen said, "He should be faced before a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I don't see more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when a powerful charge placed outside was detonated shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier the suicide bomber had detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month and, while being kept alive, he "done" to the doctors three times.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should suffer the same fate as the three other members of the Jamai Islamic terrorist cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keep him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 20 and injuring hundreds of others isn't that much.
Patek was the last of the assassins in Bali to stand trial.
He avoided arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where, less than four months later, US forces killed former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, the FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish a link between the terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't leave voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he had felt no regret for how much grief he had caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year, which will include the Bali and Australian ceremonies.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the judgment.
Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis would first appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22.
The cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church as soon as the Pope, and are the ones who vote for the Pope, so that Francis will establish his first group of men to eventually help select his successors.
He is now 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the Pope – the group shrinks to 120 voting cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a gathering of current cardinals known as the Consistorial Consumers would be held ahead of the ceremonial promotion.
"Pope Francis has decided to give his decision to convene the February Consistorium in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said the number of voting cardinals was likely to drop by February.
He said the Pope would usually appoint as many cardinals as it needed to rise to 120, and as many cardinals in excess of the age of 80 as he wanted.
The conzistorium next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is some orientation towards Europe of Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope has made his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that these cardinals would be asked by the Pope for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is an absolute novelty.
Valero said that the popes traditionally eleated bishops from large places as cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprise - so we don't know who he's appointing."
Announced series of Race Series
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an intercoms.
The choice is for improved brakes, a service package to provide access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between the different races.
Drew Bowler, technical director at Bowler Motorsport, said, "Trag participants coming to the Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable path to world-class races.
We are pleased to offer this trip in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare the contestants for the harshness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in the north and Middle East.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Strings of Autumn
The saxophone great and jazz scene legend Wayne Shorter will mark next Wednesday for the 18th year of the Strings of Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform in the Grand Hall of the Lantern on 6 November with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation of the PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra will feature the track Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, as evidenced by the fact that the Prague concert at Strings of Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he has worked with extends from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
He also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese native Joe Zawininel on his musical journey, with whom they gave the direction of the new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
He has performed in particular with the Wayne Shorter Quartet for the past 13 years.
A kind of after-party after-party after the festival will still be the club's night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
Alongside the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Czech audience will be presented with the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronica and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation of the Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis demonstrated exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
No unnecessary hype, threats and millions of pronouncements, they sent out planes, and they hit the target and came back.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and no longer comment.
The exact opposite of the confused and grandiose, the actions of Obama's unmorpled Syrian politics.
And the happiest of the attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't be fooled by the media by their claims that a "Syrian base" or "deliveries for Hezbolah" was bombed.
I wrote here recently that while US aid to the secular rebels in the country remains only on the rhetorical plane, Russia is happily continuing to supply arms to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles unloaded in the port of Latakia that was the target of an Israeli raid.
Clear message.
And note, Israel has once again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, though, according to popular internet theories, it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government honored 2 members of the Spanial Forces, probably the Delta force.
It had not been known until now that they had distinguished each time they had distinguished himself during the attack on the American consulate in Bengazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city is known, I think they were members of the CIA's secret squad that is made up of former soldiers.
There has long been speculation about what the SEALs did at the consulate or even elsewhere in the CIA's residence.
Now it is clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (it is on one of those two SEALs who died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of the American squad in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the Bengazi attack, they volunteered for the hit and, together with five private contractors, set their way to the CIA compound in Bengazi.
The Obama administration is blached by the fact that during that attack the squad was not deployed officially and whole, and that it was simply hesitant to do what.
The commando commander, so without orders he will probably release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that there are not one-time but permanently American commandos, CIA agents, and private contractors are operating in the country is quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, nothing of the sort has been officially admitted, and even now they're just talking about a sort of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is a good thing that the US, even if it is half-hearted to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although to resolve the nationwide situation, it would take a much greater help.
The last place in the secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not long ago, the media was almost praised by Iran's air forces for prosecuting American drones.
But it is not known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to be able to discover your drone in the airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
But if a drone is discovered by the Iranians in an international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it was that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chased by an American drone in the international space above sea level, when the first sharp deployment of the American F-22 Raptor super-superbeat in history.
He flocked to Phantom to visually verify his weaponry without the Phantom registering him on the radar or simply noticing him, and then suddenly appearing to him and inviting the Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed without grumbling.
No wonder when the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
Court blocks order on the procedure for stopping and searching persons by the police department in NY
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order calling for changes to the program to stop and search the people's request at the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
A second U.S. appeals federal court said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the appeal decision filed by the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program to stop and question people.
The city has challenged its conclusions and its corrective regulations, including the decision to assign supervision to the police department to help the police department change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge had to be removed from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judges, by not acting as a judge on the basis of the request to avoid the appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements to which she openly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to halt and search people.
It has established independent surveillance to oversee major changes including reform of procedures, training and surveillance, and order the launch of a pilot programme to test cameras worn on the body in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of preserving the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral grounds for the city's appeal are scheduled to be filed sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of stopping and searching people has been criticized by the ranks of civil rights defenders.
In some form, stopping and searching people has been in place for a number of decades, but recorded searches under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg have ralledly rallies to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men who are all minorities drafted a lawsuit that had become a case of a group suit.
Supporters of changes to the HA Police Department's halting and search-trapping program claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and influence how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but it will not solve the broader problem of the police force under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that she had not ended the practice of stopping and searching the people that was constitutional, but she had reformed the way the searches were instituted by the police department in NY.
CDC Center issues schools guidelines on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in case of child-based allergies to food at school.
This is the first set of such directives to be issued by the US government, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food.
The CDC center found that the incidence of food allergies in children had risen by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools on how the teaching staff and the staff to inform about child allergies to food and how to respond to an allergic reaction if occur.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline - the most commonly used EpiPen automatic injection is to be used - to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more simply.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone's been injected in my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "She's iting my tongue."
How Tipsport (not)brasphell personal data.
More than a year ago, I did a registration on the Tipsport.cz website.
But I subsequently did not finish it, because there was someone at the branch who couldn't finish the registration from the internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration forfeited, then I moved and because of that, my ID number changed.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I couldn't do it because I have a different OP number, the address and that I just can't finish it and that I should ask for the data to be deleted and make a new registration.
So I did that, and on 24.10.2013 I wrote in technical support that I am asking for the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
For that, a short-legged day, she wrote me a technical support to finish the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of e-mails in technical support, where they eventually wrote after the 4th urgci 25.10. that the personal data had been deleted at my request.
So one would think that he could make the new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I do not understand it has been deleted - it is not a personal figure, but in the end they also disable this).
So I used a different username and it popped up to me that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that they said they deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When asked how it was possible to write back to me that the personal data had actually been erased on 25.10. and to send an e-mail with the mistake.
I did that (at the night of the 15th hour) and on the same time I was written off today that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that is why I cannot, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What does it matter that I have been contacting for a week and I've been working out with them that I still can't.
And what about the fact that if what is true to say (such as it is not) could not be registered by anyone with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in the 1 p.m.22 I actually registered, in the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictitious e-mail and a phone number and, wonder, a page appeared to me that the e-mail sent me a link to complete the registration.
But how is this possible if it is not possible to register in the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds a registration to an email and a phone number and just didn't unlock the data as he claims.
So I again communicated this technical support that they are simply lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they are writing) because what they write is not true.
I've added several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. so the "false" registration simply doesn't affect this.
Tipsport wrote off a stark sentence for me - I'm sorry, but by the fact that you're back on the register, we can't check out your claims.
And he ended the communication.
Respectively, it repeats the same sentence over and over again that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They can't even accept the fact that the registration wasn't completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and so it didn't actually take place.
So, in summary, Tipsport has not only failed to erased the data as they claim, but is still lying when it says otherwise.
What makes it even worse is that it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer's side.
Incidentally, after the launch of this matter on my personal blog, things started to move a bit, and an e-mail came from the Technical Support that the matter was being passed on for screening and I would be informed (after a week of urging and arguing and warning of the same error).
We are sorry to kill, but we are innocent, defends the leaders of the Khmer Rouge
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975, they lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture, torture, and executions of more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population of the time.
This commander, the notorious S-21, was given a life prison in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by belieing they were acting in the nation's best interests and unaware of the true extent of the killing.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything, and thus intervened and rectify the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think that I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadors to "take people to misman or kill them to deny them food or commit genocide."
But he did admit to "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP that she could not accept Nuon Chea's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be exonerated."
"You're in for others," she said.
"If he didn't give orders, his subordinates wouldn't kill," she added, noting that the leaders of the Khmer Rouge were "worst than the monsters."
The "foreign minister" of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sary, was also to be in court, but he died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then-Minister of Social Affairs, was founding an incompetent trial in September 2012 for dementia.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, died in 1998.
A fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
The British entrepreneur has made the first ice cream to shine in the dark - using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous treat.
The idea came up when he read a scholarly treatise on jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically manufacture the protein that causes luminous.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer's tongue - increasing the pH level in the protein and then causing it to be radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it responds with the heat of your mouth, which is why the more you line, the brighter the brighter.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (sook me, I taste great), says: "It's an amazing fabric, but when it comes to making, we're at the beginning, so for GBP 200 you get about 2g of this fabric."
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, your mouth increases the pH level and the ice cream begins to shine.
We've tested it over the last few months and seems to be a great idea for Halloween to celebrate because it's causing this fantastic, shining effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish luminous is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every hill costs me about £140.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is set to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, it's impossible because of the refrack of light caused by the ice crystals that make the ice cream, but I'm counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.

Oil price plummets further to $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high inventories were offset by a report that showed the strengthening of China's energy-highing energy-high sector.
The US oil indicator for December deliveries fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in European e-commerce trading on the New York trade exchange on the New York trade exchange.
The decline was 39 cents on Thursday and fell 5.8 percent in the month of October.
Rich oil reserves have been weighing on the price in recent weeks.
The Department for Energy said Wednesday that US stocks have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, stocks have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, two reports of Chinese manufacturing came to give rise to greater demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to be boosted by growth, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Brent oil crite, an indicator for international oil also used by US refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the International Trade Exor, in London.
Martin Doktor on problems with the Sochi Olympics: Communication with Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth are indicated by a slight smile, and then he exoners to a deep breath: "It's challenging."
Collaboration with the Sochi 2014 Sochi 2014 Olympics organisational team is a little more complicated than that.
What was at the last Olympics, we can forget.
"Nothing works the same way," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A number of things work more slowly and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively quick, not so much in terms of delivering information about essential things.
Perhaps we have been leveing from them for three months to deliver to us how the individual villages will be officially designated, so that we can do a whole lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating with this thing.
They're always communicating in a number of things.
Is the Olympic Village at least already built?
But it's not a disastrous condition anymore.
A month ago, we walked around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just the basic concrete, that's what the state was a month ago.
But they still have time.
While there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26th as a vanguard, he will still smell of glue.
And if they're late, what?
President Putin would you think he'd have the military there?
That's what's going to happen.
Just so it's not that the Olympic Village = the Potemkin villages.
Rather, they are in danger of not being able to make the travel arrangements, for example, they do not finish the details.
They may have the roads in such a state that we'll have to take our boots with us from the London Games.
But I believe they'll get it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
There are roughly 78 of them now, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Perhaps the figure skaters will probably ride in the trio they went out.
No one has to doubt about speed skating skating Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Still a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should not be there until January 26th.
What the houses in the Olympic Village will look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves by the subway so we wouldn't just believe the sketch.
We are also preparing a whole range of other things, including transport.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am doing a normal agenda in the sense of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Instead of a post-election sirloin, a post-election stew
The October elections brought a bunch of losers rather than the winners.
These are not only parties that have not even made it to the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. the SPOZ), but also the previous governing parties (ODS, TOP 09) and, ultimately, the ČSSD because of their internal split.
Instead of a holiday sirloin, the politicians served us the post-election stew over the weekend.
The jumper of the election was the Andrej Babiš movement, which promised voters to change the political style of governance to date.
The fragmentation of the election result and split in the winning party plays into the political ()agency of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported or elected to the House of Commons.
The president may have lost a strategic lead over other politicians because of an unpleasant event, but he has a few ways to get it back - for example, by selecting a future prime minister.
While the CSSD is moving away from the chances of winning a prime minister's seat in my eyes, they are getting closer to businessman Andrej Babiš.
Post-election developments are so far miles away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing ČSSD government supported by the Communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy is still better news.
Given the loud opposition of YES to get together with the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still the most likely option of the coalition of the ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies).
Given the split in the CSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak parterre in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be quite dismal for the CSSD.
The minority ČSSD government composed with the "Nestanovs" in the Castle is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the CSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead to a further split in the party sooner or later.
So I ask myself: "Are we not going to do it by the next early election?"
Another election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the ANO vote.
The GOP's plans to introduce sectoral taxes, increase in income taxes, or the building of a state-owned bank have been hopefully fallen under the table.
The parties of the ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit, on the other hand, agree, for example, on the promotion of entrepreneurship, a sparing fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged people, to reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Treight areas are most common in the view of the social policy and the size of the state.
But ANO now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition so far, the ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would lean more to the right.
Which, in my view, is a better result than a left-wing tax program for everything that is still moving in the economy.
More recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, the squandering of money for overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
According to the election results, it can be inferred that most citizens were comfortable with this state of affairs.
That they didn't really mind and with the state that was (the steal and debt of this state) were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I can't explain to myself that 3,413,497 voters did not appear to vote, with 596 357 voters voting for TOP 09 38,4147 voters voted for the ODS in total,4 394,028 in all, in effect, to support the original governing coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
When I add 1,016,829 GOP voters to the aforementioned parties, then with the old order (because all of the above parties were involved in the "steal of theft" and the indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the rightful electorate actually agreed to this state of affairs.
In fact, most voters have indicated that they are not in favour of punishing the culprits of the country's the upwors and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think the members of the GOP who participated in it will adhet on the proper laws?
Is it even to help us?
Olomouc to open a public ice rink in the historic centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas and winter skating markets, Pavel Spálený, said that the preparatory work at the rink started on October 26 and an ice-producing aggregate has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimetres thick and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The rink has an area of 375 square metres, the stage took up 358 square metres.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two stalls with punch.
"We have expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stalls and almost the entire area of the podium is roofed so that the skaters can be comfortably re-transpelled," Spálený described.
The streets of Olomouc already resemble the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the rink was installed to repair the Lower Square directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so the ice sheet could return to its original location.
People could skate for the first time in front of the town hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice sheet then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural programme, will start in the Upper Square a month before Christmas Eve.
Scientists have more enlighten how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
More earlier research showed that joyful dogs wag its tails wag its tale to the right (from the dog's view), while the nervous dogs wave their tails mostly to the left.
But now scientists are saying that other dogs can record and respond to these fine differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said, "With people, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain have different links to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
We tried to observe the same in other species.
He added that, as is the case with humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information about how dogs respond to the asymmetric wagging of other dogs' tail, researchers were monitoring the animals that followed films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail goes one way, and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, "We have scoured dogs' films about dogs - whether in the natural version or in the form of silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the tail's movement and represent it more to the right or the left."
When the animals saw the otherwise bland dog moving the tail to the right (from the view of a tail-croaking dog), they remained perfectly at ease.
But when she recorded the tail-shooting, she largely to the left (agraming with her tail-wracking dog again), their heart rate increased and the animals seemed in a precarious position.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that the dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they have to take and which they do not have to look out for.
He said: "If you encounter dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behaviour and movement to the right begets less friendly behaviour, you will respond on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavioural expert John Bradshaw, a university lecturer at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side was important to dogs.
Last year, a Lincoln University team found that dogs turned their heads to the left as they watched the aggressive dog and, on the right, looking at a cheerful dog.
And in another scholar's treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said, "With a dog robot, the dogs were more likely to get acquainted with the dogs when it flogged its tail to the left than the right, when they were becoming more uncertain - quite the opposite of the Italian study."
The difference, he says, can be due to the fact that dogs in these different studios did not read the animals in the films or dog robots completely as dogs.
He explained that a study could help about how dogs respond to real dogs.
"Although in the case of many different mammals there are strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand why their tail goes one way on one side and another at another.
RBS suspends two foreign currency dealers
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Scottish Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that global investigations by the inspection bodies regarding suspicious monetary market machinations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the competent authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is switching hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the broadening investigation, which is the response to the LIBOR (London's interbank interest rate) scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our relentless search is continuing on this matter and we are cooperating fully with FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event said that RBS had given the British financial conduct records of emails and quick messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been vacated from his current position as European foreign currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European chairman of trading for cash in Citi, took a holiday this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former head of currencies at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders was charged with any offence.
Mr Usher's Quick News Group included the Barclays and Citigroup bankers, said the people of the event.
UBS said this week that after the Swiss inspection body Finma announced that it had investigated suspicious foreign currency market machinations in several Swiss banks, it had taken action against one of its employees.
Globally, at least six offices – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority, Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong – are examining the claim that these bankers were in league to move the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combed with years-old quick messages and emails to find incidents of any offence.
News of investigations has alarmed traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines for making profit in the closure of investment banks in the past years, but which was disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by claiming that the vast and highly liquid foreign currency market is essentially impossible to be manipulated, but high-ranking traders say this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily foreign currency trading, the liquidity-inning of different trading firms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse reported that it had fired from its stock trading department of a trader, which caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the relevant authorities and is cooperating with their control authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved," said Credit Suisse.
He negotiated the government with both Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babiš.
The People's Party won fourteen deputies in the election, or only one-third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to haggle with the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who debuted the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002, and 2006 for the People's Party.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
It will probably be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal then," Kasal says, estimating how this year's talks will unfold.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35), from the town of Tiptree in Essex, was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to accusing himself of driving carelessly and inattentively.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to reimburse the cost of £90 and a £100 premium for the accused.
Sleep: I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have the juice, lust and enthusiasm
For Prospal, family has always come first, so he wants to submit to her full in the first place at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he'll finally quit hockey.
"I want to play the role of daddy and husband."
"I'm looking forward to it a lot," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Despite the fact that he is a renowned worker who will never cheat anything.
Despite the fact that he always lets his heart out on the ice and can pull his teammates down.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still there," he says firmly.
He may see it, reportedly wanted by the New York Rangers, who failed to make the season, and they have injured two forwards - forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What's the look like with your arrival in the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in dwelling on it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post that I should be signed, but that's all.
Nowhere was it added that it had indeed happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not the case.
Didn't you even get back from the club?
Such communication in the NHL is on a daily basis.
That's the point of getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When, say, a player gets injured or someone can't do it and the team doesn't go by.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get that contract.
But in New York, that's the kind of circumstances that happen, right?
The injured man is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make the start of the season, so there's some chances there, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The second thing is, you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't received one yet.
Unfortunately, that is the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you in anticipation that something might work out after all?
I've had those expectations since the NHL's free-agent market opened on July 5, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to be reminded of yourself?
I'm going to Tampa for the kids and my wife.
I'm looking forward to the sunshine and seeing you again.
Do you have any planned program?
That's because I'm the father and the husband and that's where it all comes from.
At the moment, I'm not a hockey player - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of daddy and husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday Vasik has two hockey games, that is a holiday for me and my whole family to be able to support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking of doing this in a full-time quotes?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This, too, can happen.
I tried it out three years ago when I missed 50 fights for knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very, very much.
Someday it gets to the stage that all the goals, victories and passes don't make up for what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Let's have whatever work you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Being a hockey player, first place - besides the family - is a sporting achievement.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is that.
My children, I mean, sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we'd love them to continue this trend.
Because what we're going to tell ourselves, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else entirely.
That's the chance we should offer them.
So are you planning on staying in America permanently?
We'll practice it like we do.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia in the Czech Republic and in the vicinity of České Budějovice.
And in the winter, back in Tampa or where our steps take us.
It's perfect being warm all the time.
I've been extremely lucky in my life.
You could say that I went to meet him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took away a lot of things I missed.
But hockey in turn offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I could choose where to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who are yearing for this to choose what to do and how they will live.
How long will you have the will to toil, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. That desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell how much longer it's going to stay.
It's impossible to plan.
So you could say that this season you'll wait for the way it goes and then decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage where I'm going from the day.
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are not themes that the American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would pit on casually.
In the conception of his quartet, which will culminate in the grand hall of the Prague Lucerna in the grand hall of the Prague Summer Festival, everything is related to everything.
The partition of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are to play what they are experiencing.
They treat music as a completely improvised chamber affair, and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, the newly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-time Grammy winner, a former teammate of Miles Davis and now perhaps the largest living jazz saxophonist - is reluctantly to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of eighty, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything and then they are disappointed when things go differently," Shorter says.
Jagr joked: Goal from the breaker?
He got the puck in the defensive zone and was never caught again.
He also converted the leak after a quick forehand loop.
Jaromir Jagr scored like this against Tampa on Wednesday night, then commented on the 119th NHL-based goal on the social networking site Facebook on Thursday night.
"After viewing this video, my agent Petr Svoboda contacted the director of Czech Railways and asked him if I would be interested in advertising for their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" Jágr wrote at the outset.
They say we're a very much typecast.
I guess I'll have to quit my night practice so I don't accelerate any more.
"I'm afraid the Secretary of Defense could call in afterwards and he'd like to advertise for the jets!" he added with the smiley faces.
In addition, New Jersey claimed their second win in a row.
"Ms all, you've noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrova is working," concluded Jagr.
Brutal murder of senior senior in Zlín to be re-hearled by regional court
The regional court acquitted a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men pleaded not guilty.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the High Court annulled the regional decision and relaunch the matter for consideration.
The reasons for the judge were declined to comment, saying the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the teenagers ambushed a 79-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a harresting death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled him, beat and kicked him all over his body, and also, with a metal object, apparently a gas pistol, he set about three dozen blows to his head.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures to the skull, swelling of the brain or bleeding in the brain, which he succumbed to at the scene.
The teenagers reportedly took about CZK 3,000 from the house and the jewellery worth about CZK 14,000.
According to the regional court, they were the only, in addition, only circumstantial evidence against the defendants' scent traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established within the meaning of the legal instructions.
The scent of the crime scene and other items coincided with the defendants in more than a dozen cases, however, the police initially treated them as material and not scent traces.
In addition, there were some errors in the handling of them.
According to the Senate the guilt of the defendants was not established without a doubt.
However, the court accepted that the police had very difficult conditions.
The dead elderly man with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
The violent death was not even brought to the attention of the emergency services doctor.
It was only after a few days that the forensics officers were contacted by Olomouc doctors, who discovered the hallmarks of a violent death during the autopsy.
Police could no longer work with all the footprints from the scene, which had been cleaned by the relatives.
No DNA was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradišťsko.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was finally confirmed by the Delhi High Court last year.
The man, he said, was the head of an organized group of six teenagers who were responsible for the jewellery jewelry robbery.
The robbery happened in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopný.
The younger of the accused of murdering the elderly lives in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Will Czech Television ever go around without signing events?
She entered the era of President Zeman with a legendary scene with an ashtray, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that gather the documents of the castle's retinue.
In the past, the traditional influence of such an Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík was not documented in this way, let alone to sign it.
True, the editors stood up for the management.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such attachment of some journalists to the Squires is taken from - whether it is a response to a direct order or, lest we use vulgarism, a typical expression of unseemathic empathetic.
And, as we assume a general rottenness, one cannot forgive the question of whether other, equally unscrupulous, power interests that have yet to be given the opportunity to change their circumstances in television seek.
The truth is for those who say that in developed countries, the spectacle attempts to intervene politicians to be broadcasting do not come to the broadcast.
But the truth is also that this does not mean that complaints to public media do not exist there.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticise mainly what they see as the tendentious nature inherent in them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have simply not reached this civilisation stage yet and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps, in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about evil politicians and good journalists are spent more comfortably than more complicated descriptions of a messy situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings comes to mind.
While crowds of horse-chouling experts were gathering in Cardiff to fight for the Tsar of the Year award, it was clear to all that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet in school and only a few months ago took his first steps, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly trudged through three rounds to eventually win the grand prize and leave behind in 30 protracted adult rivals.
This inseparable pair – with the same height - were praised for their appearance, and in appearance, and style at the annual competition operated by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry, near Cardiff.
He faced the gentlemen and ladies in the elegant hats, tilled his beret to a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee parade around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control the horses, far exceeding his age.
And Toffee got the highest grades for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee in March for his third birthday and has been practicing with this Shetland pony a day since.
His mother, Donna (30), said, "Fenton and Toffee are working together brilliantly."
They didn't have much hope, but they finally left with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal and complete strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is in the footsteps of his aunt, Sharon Howells, who has been showing off her horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded."
He ran across the sand along the length of the arena and, although he looked so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors and a farm and was put in charge of two chickens.
Considering the way he started, he'll be back at the Mountain of the Year competition again, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse showmine contest said, "Fentons are only three, but he already knows how to control the pony."
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they had performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork between the pony and the one guides him is – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oate.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by the delightful outfit, he really fell in with him.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a snitch in the US intelligence service, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, who the MP gave to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as flaws and seeks to criminalise political speeches with difficult lawsuits that do not give room for defence."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that supporting the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the charges of criminal offences against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
Tensions in the US-AM-Ga. relationship began to rise when allegations were being reported that the NSA had tapped in Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who runs a parliamentary panel overseeing the coverage, said that if there was any opportunity to interview Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and that relations with the US are completely destroyed," should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a picture of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
On his trip to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to the former NSA contract lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left one day.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need to be assured that he would be "failure" there, a member of parliament said.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said he had faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the world's reaction to his "act of political expression" had given him the courage.
Citizens throughout and senior officials – including those in the United States – have assessed the revelation of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "up to the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved."
To avoid hating with hatred
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After long years of reading, living but not writing, publishing VCLAV KAHUDA (1965) a new novel, The Wit, the dark, present.
That it will not be a slender volume is the number of pages comparable to his most famous work Houština (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahuda, another prominent Czech writer of the moment - Emil Hakl - confessed.
What did it go to say that you wrote a novel after twelve years of silence?
I did it - to not choke on the hatred.
To see around you all the new and new clones of that human folk pettiness, the young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavors.
I'm not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by helpless lustre, the rowdy souls, and the opposite-turned by ideologues who try to sell their "product" with the air of a small saleable whores.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my jurore's jurore's friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
I've passed it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from my life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks, and then I read books at the light of the evening.
You're talking about feeling frust in, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The breakthrough came a long time ago, at about the age of ten.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, that's what I did to live after.
There's still a quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see more solitary practicers, each in their tornado of anxiety.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm attending to this giant, thousands of years of movement of the system of life on this planet - the zonny of the elusive future.
That immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game where, on the path of trial-error, more and more generations of beings are created, creating some superhuman, official intelligence in the bilio of interactions per second.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Are you as a rolling process of writing, or did you start from scratch?
The singling, or rather, the dialogue that is conducted by the right and the left half of the brain, sometimes spans to the surface and forms into a book.
As periods of peace are intertold with the quietly sleeping metastases of wars that may wake up one day - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the mute avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, one day it would overwhelming me quietly.
It's a set of questions that have been formulated by the brain and asked by the layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness."
Neokortex, a grey cortex, asks older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient ringtheys of the brain tree.
He speaks to the fur-fling beasts, asks the serpents, seeks the answer in the flight of birds, raises his gaze to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heaven over me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively, you often comment on the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical links all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has had.
This forest is using the logical and emotionally displayed and branched trees of information, the registers of memory, the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, exposed to the ever-changing present, in a relentless effort to try to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there's overload malfunctions.
By analogy - as if you "fly down" a PC, from a language emulator program and a foreign language translator would be entangled first in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarters, ended up with a darkly green-gimmic Biosu screen, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about - I am talking about a psychospirital crisis.
Do you mention it often - why do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the doposavad of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a breakthrough will appear.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He stared into the abyss for so long, until the abyss looked into him."
A pure feeling - that a person is lost if all hopes disappear, mentally "art" and a new quality comes in.
And why do I care personally?
I will answer the parables.
Once one had fallen into the tent and drowned, running for days, months and summers, and he was always drowning while reading, and those books had taught him how to swim - to live, that is.
He became a "diversal."
Perhaps someone's sentence written by me will help, as Hrabal's lyrics once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the particular person who will read your text?
The one that cannot be told meaningful, some call it a consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else-this reader is involved directly in the phrasing process of words and sentences."
From his early teenth, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nemo, ran around the Shadows in the Dark Alons.
In the end, in the end, behind all the branches of the authors and their messages, reads: "The sun of the clear worlds of others, Hynek Mácha."
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the back bounce that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, perhaps years later, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are actually "lives" or, rather, "worlds."
They are encoded in the characters of the letters, bearing the experience, the history of the regions of each language.
Whenever we can bring them to life if we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It is, in a way, something forbidden to be divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonological books, we are committing witchcraft.
After the book is published, you - as it are - awaiting a chain of author readings.
I remember you used to like reading.
Do you get into it again with joy, or do you feel differently years later?
Today, I'd rather just tell the story.
And what did I find in the doing so?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic sign - they are unobtrusive, they don't draw much attention to themselves, they have friendly radiates, you don't feel lonely with them.
I will give you an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec lived was (and I hope he still lives) one curly book-chick (it is a conveniently called Cervenka), a cheerful crony and a good girl's bull.
In one leech, he introduced me to the individual articles of the readers' chain of readers of my book Houština.
I stared into their eyes, and then I was shown a crumbled, read-reading specimen of my book.
I was embarrassed to put down the just-read jitrnic and briefly wept in a manly.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and teared drunkenly with emotion.
Then the young blond, the young blond, did not last, and sprang roar out his head from the window into the snowdrift.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night's landscapes and the happy rabies of the quoters, the aching soul of the countrymen and the morsel of backstre patriots - howling and brawling like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is, formally and content, different from the previous ones.
Is this also true of the text, Wind, the darkness, the present?
It's a storytelling.
It's a fairy tale about a country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his amendment, Suchodol, Ivan Bunin puts the words of an old Russian fable in the mouth of the folk healer: At the Sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujanu.
There's a dog, a grey chest on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps we were devils in hell a long time ago and drew lots - what role we would play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or will you leave it back on the free influx of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Brezina.
Writing is a marvellous way of dialogue.
Something of the vast and unnameable, similar to the movement of the continents on the planet, is influenced by our will from such depth and in such a wide way that it completely transcends our horizon - and so, with absolute commonness, we do our precisely in the terms of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mingle, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes a malfunction happens and we recite the compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disturbances, standing on the ocean coast of the unconscious, the leaky sail made from a dirty handkerchief catching the tides of warm wind.
I have to write to be human.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, it will be necessary to study at least one of Shakespeare's plays, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include "hidden text" to encourage deeper reading;
The combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to have a graduation language exam, and they will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Education Ministry should issue a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other major items are expected to be made next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exam's exam, it will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with the new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was a "wr & broad consensus on whether we need to reform our examine system to regain the trust of society," and that we need to insist that the graduation exam is "more challenging, ambitious and stricter."
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
By way of comparison, schools in Australia devote an average of 143 hours a year to mathematics and to Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official request to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that a comprehensive maths graduation exam – along with a greater emphasis on the subject in the scoreboards – is likely to encourage schools to provide extra classes.
The currating plan will focus more on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not the cancer in the CSSD
Ahead of the election, the long-figning controversial was on fire between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava-Wed-JSSD.
It all came to a head when the Mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, went to court for the undemocratic formation of the candidates.
Still, the case's actuariots did not want to comment too much to damage the party even more before the election.
But now the votes of the electorate are counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava-based ČSSD immediately called on the Mayor of Ostrava to leave the party on Monday evening and will probably push for him to lose his post as well.
But Petr Kajnar wants to fight on.
What the disputes are about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview with the Journal.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The CSSD was certainly counting on a much better result.
It was damaged in our country that disputes within the party were being resolved in the media before the elections?
I imagine that a social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it fits the state of the CSSD in now.
It is a party that has its internal problems, is intrinsically ill, and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the CSSD?
The ODS has been going through the ODS for some time, I think, and unfortunately, things like this are happening in a social democracy.
The case is that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their prebends with the ODS, have moved to the people of the CSSD and are influential in them.
It then has to do with the fact that the Ostrava Municipality's offices are visited by the police and collect computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not only made up of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think of their own good in the first place.
The CSSD is divided into two impremirable camps in Prague, as can also be seen in the current power struggle between Haškovci and Sobotkovci.
But that, too, had been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a foretight to what was happening in Prague.
The Hashk's wing gradually filled its positions, so that after the election it could trigger a situation that would weaken Sobotka's wing.
One is in a situation in politics where one sometimes has to compromise.
But everyone has some internal boundaries where the compromises can't be made anymore, and that's the case with me.
Originally, I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing within the party, I made a deal with Luboš Zaoralek to try to get on the regional ticket to strengthen Sobotka's wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But Hashk's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Hašek?
Slávek Sobotka, in my opinion, is a man who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and, to a certain extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I confess I have not heard anything like that on the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only start removing the party chairman.
This is a power struggle, regardless of everything and against the statutes of the party.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has now done in Prague, he has ended his political career.
How did you feel about the fact that the Ostrava-based leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you on the ballot.
Political parties are based on a competition to see who will be positioned as of their members.
The competition should for the most part be based on the program visions and the capabilities of these people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have much ability or vision, but a political party is a lift to the money they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people come to the fore by breaking the rules without scruples, breaking the rules.
They make their practices out of the political parties mafias and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to take into account whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties start to respect the statutes.
Is that why, before the election, did you file a motion for a preliminary injunction against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava is consolidating its power by the fact that it can abolish the organizations that do not suit it, purposefully establish new organizations, gradually throw away inconvenient party members.
One example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarek from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then rescinded the resolution to dismiss him.
This shows that while claiming compliance with the party's statutes through the courts is the last resort, it is the only option at the moment when the other ways and control bodies within the CSSD have ceased to work.
The Ostrava-Wed SD leadership, headed by MEP Adam Rykala, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, is in charge of this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, they get the votes, and for those votes they consolidate their power in the party.
Going back to the past, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could call me a man who puts money where he doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought property that is strategically of great value to it.
So how do you see it further with your continued tenure as mayor?
The district committee has already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the CSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Oh, crab a thief!
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I don't see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy who will initiate and enforce, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many development things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
All the same, I become uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than I'm in the way of the others to get through to the places they want.
Will you still be fighting these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively run the state when they can't even manage themselves.
So I'm not thinking of leaving the GOP now, because I think the one who causes cancer in this party is not me, but these people who are trying to get me out of it.
We want to show that Plzeň still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's a bit of a paradox.
While his team has not been doing well in the first place recently, Viktoria Plzen's defender or midfielder, František Rajtoral, has a form that earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He is also doing well with shooting, he is in the activity, after a tackle on him he was ordered with a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached the final two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after a victory, but in the end they took only one point from the two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team will break the awkward streak in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will beat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is preparing carefully for a tough match with the Saints, who play offensive football.
Everything is heading towards the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent's game.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative attracts the fans to the Doosan Arena stands.
Pilsen's last matches have not come out as they would have wished, but the word of the crisis is rejected by the Victory defender.
That's the way of football, sometimes you have good form and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis in any case.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," the West Indies defender.
The Victory team will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's played on Friday night and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to both Zeman and ODS.
I have repeatedly called in open letters in recent months for students, educators and the management of secondary schools in several regions to defend the academic freedoms before the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman at the schools.
I was met with more or lesser success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the honorary chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received retaliation in the form of not being invited to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer so brave and were made possible by Miloš Zeman's visit: Brno University of Technology, Gymnasium Hladnov in Ostrava, University of Business of Entrepreneurship in Ostrava, Commercial Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now seeing in Pardubice with the continuation of the promotion of policy at universities.
The newly elected ODS MP, the dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal.
Professor, this is really not the same as staying as mayor of a smaller city, for example.
Do you want to join the GOP governors who are simultaneously for the job of MP and the governor and, like them, to downgrade both professions?
You're telling people that you can handle both of these challenging functions with the left-back.
I know, we have the example of Michal Hašek, who even manages several dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not exactly an example of the person you should be following.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post in order to devote herself fully to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean, however, is that by the concurrent functions you are violating the apoliticality of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current performance in both posts as an advantage for the University.
"But you will be able to help your school without remaining the dean.
I think that a similar opinion to me and the rector Miroslav Ludwig will have a similar opinion, so will your students.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count it for you in the next election.
And that doesn't have to be long-lasting.
John Kerry admitted: Spying went too far!
The United States has occasionally gone "too far" in spying, the head of US diplomacy, John Kerry, admitted to AFP during a video conference between Washington and London.
But the collection of information, according to the minister, was used to avert terrorist attacks.
The "first confession from Washington," according to AFP, was echoed in the midst of a violent polemic on both sides of the Atlantic because of the scandalous revelations about mass data surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which has also been targeted by American allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he mainly defended the previous practice.
The collection of information, he said, was essential to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US, the Madrid assassinations in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, buildings exploded and humans were being murdered because we were able to be informed about the farea in time," Kerry pointed out.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone unreasonably far."
The affair surrounding U.S. intelligence, which allegedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans had also watched the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their indignation, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to ban or significantly restrict surveillance.
The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) had been charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord
The Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children learned that before the 2011 allegations against child educator Jonathan Lord Lord of Caringbah were brought, two employees of the Christian Young Men's (YMCA) association of Young Men (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexual abuse.
But it was said before the commission that in its opening statement to the commission, the association said that they had never dealt with the case of sexual abuse of a child in their organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one of the YMCA employees was charged with child pornography offences and another, when a gym teacher in Caringbah of the YMCA was convicted in 1991 for the sexual harassment of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the commission's adviser, that he knew of the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the initial YMCA statement was also inaccurate in the making when it stated that external audits were being conducted at the YMCA to award the organisation as a leading supporter of children's rights.
The evidence submitted by the commission suggests that the YMCA was alerted to the fact that it received the second lowest of the four possible evaluations in an audit by the Ministry of Education and the Company in August this year.
Mr Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the management had failed from him downwards when he received Lord, without being satisfied that the staff was aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Previously, this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys he had committed during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a breach of child safety by the Lord.
Members of staff had given evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that Lord had been alone with the children, guarding them privately, leaving them sitting on his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because of his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of the services of the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, had testified that was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to him about."
The director general said he did not accept the evidence of the staff, that they felt unextled if they were to contact their superiors and report the deeds.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had clouded their judgment, and they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had given his opinion to the YMCA board in New South Wales that the "Jonathan Lord's case" for the organization was that the staff had "not given any report" and the council agreed with it.
Mr. Hare said the decision to let the staff sign the confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged were made by the general manager for the children's services at the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid disrupting the evidence, but it was "overly zealous" and ill-conducted.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organisation for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, vetting, incorporating, training and staff management.
The hearing was on a post-stre-station until December 20.
President of the Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Greening to Savings Should Continue
Since 2008, the Czech Construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the lack of interest of the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measures, will save substantial amounts of heating, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring the state more than 2700 newly created jobs.
In terms of the state's fiscal policy, significant leverage and multiplier effects are also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore strongly disagrees with the government's resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow the programme to continue to be continued in order to launch further calls within its framework.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological achievements on airplanes (but they are not allowed to call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from the gateway" - in addition to calling from their mobile phones - to read, play gaming, viewing films and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But passengers are not to expect the changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary from airlines to aviator, FAA administrator Michael Huerta told a press conference.
Airlines will need to demonstrate to the FAA administration how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and have updated the on-board crew training manuals and the facility storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already handed over the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the enhanced use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in its statement.
Passengers are currently required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain doesn't issue a warrant.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane descends to land and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft, which have been modified to allow passengers to use the Wifi at a higher altitude, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards' Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are implemented safely – and we will work closely with the transport companies on this - it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
We are, frankly tired of looking like "watchdogers."
However, surfing the internet, sending emails and sms or downloading data will continue to be banned under 3 kilometres of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aerial mode.
So there's still no Words with friends, an online scrabble-type game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was, as is well known, was fired from an American Airlines plane because he refused to shut down his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to be kept on hold because of fears that they might hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are determined not by the FAA, but by the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Department for Transport, a national security expert in transport at CBS News, said mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from the FCC data that they can cause the airborne tore to be disturbed in the air," Rosenker said.
The FAA Obora Advisory Committee, set up to examine the problem, proposed last month that the government allow the wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, argue that there is no rightful security ground for the ban.
Restrictions are also finding it increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers also forget the obligation to dismantle or ignore their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the disrupting of navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the technical achievement of the time.
New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also designed, and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
The plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should be adapted for greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huertová said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio broadcasting than has been with previous generation devices.
For example, e-readers issue only minimal broadcasts when pages are reversed.
But the broadcast is stronger when the device downloads or sends data.
Among those who are pushing to loosen restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded the airliner with their Kindle e-readers and conducted a test flight, but there was no problem.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aeronautical Passenger Association said he believed that the interference from these facilities was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices could cause air systems to be dism been dism been dism been made, and most of these reports were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device during low-curreence-based devices.
The group of the travel industry welcomed these changes and is, in its view, a reasonable procedure for the travelling public, which uses the technology to a heaternity.
"We are delighted that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, managing director of the American Travel Association.
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage "did too far"
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the US defense stance on his surveillance programs, saying in an unprecedented admission that in some cases espionage "hit too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as a "autopic" about the "autopic" about the NSA's spying on the pro-ho, thanks to the informant Edward Snowden.
The information released sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, via a video-connection to the government's open conference in London, said, "There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have taken to the inertia, because that option was, referring to the Second World War, the difficult period of the Cold War, and then, of course, on 9/11."
So he became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the line, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and is already conducting a thorough review to make sure that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this trial.
However, Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA sought good, and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We are seeing a new world in which people are willing to detonate themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to murdering and blowing people up and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashed, buildings exploded, and people not executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs told the European affairs subcommittee on Thursday that US lawmakers were preparing to respond to foreign concerns about alleged American espionage and convinced Europeans that they must continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week, and that he was concerned about their threats to stop participation in counter-terrorism organizations because they were disilliterated by the National Security Agency (NSA).
It is really important for the national-security interests of the US that Europe remains with us in the same boat, with a view to the joint efforts to combat terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the democratic party and the presiding Senate subcommittee on European affairs in foreign relations, in an interview from Washington.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA's programmes.
Reports in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some of America's allies, even though the agency's chief executive said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO's allies collected and shared with the United States,
Further revelations were quoted as saying by documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had been tracking the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other as many as 34 world leaders.
National News Director James Clapper defended the Allies' espionage as necessary and said it was a routine matter on both sides.
In the middle of the uproar, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year, and he hoped that members of both parties and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to participate are to be released.
He said the program was still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the aim of the trip was to help repair relations, he added that "well-in-item educational measures" would also be ready.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to the spy programs they have used for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also be aware of the fact that we are not the only ones who are doing espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is on schedule this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to respond to the hostility sparked by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as American surveillance activities.
For the words 'Mugabe is a limp donkey' no longer in danger of jail, court annulled the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be very careful about the eighty-nine-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and has been at its forefront since late 1987.
Under section 33 of the Penal Code, the disrespect of the presidency was punishable by a fine of $100 to one year in prison.
"State representatives should not be keen to blame the people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermined freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal the court's decision, the British BBC reported.
The law was loudly outspoken by Zimbabweans, among them Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist in prison, frequenting Mugabe's public scolder with a "felling donkey."
In August, the prosecutor charged a 26-year-old man with his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe's face as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later prove to be false," said Deputy Attorney General Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law allowed a person who discloses the false information to be sentenced to twenty years of prison.
"The existence of a law allowing the criminalising of someone to be criminalized for a false statement has a freezing effect on the right to express themselves freely," Malala added.
Not to mention that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
Small steps away from the country's one-man dictatorship, he came in in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangirai to the premiership.
Nevertheless, the country continues to be plagued by the economic crisis and, until 2008, the world's highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government therefore abolished the national currency in full.
Today, Zimbabwe is paid for only by currencies by other states.
The hallowed economy is on Mugabe's ill-consens-consensh agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with the running of farms.
Young couple mature for living with their parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given as an assignment to design the house on the plot, which lies on the corner of two streets, with the property itself sloping somewhat.
The request went on to say that two generations would live in the house who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separate space.
The younger couple needed an extra small office.
The house is on the corner of two streets and on a gently sloping plot of land.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"In the design, we respected the family's ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The parents' household is on the level of a garden with an old pine, to which family traditions and memories are linked.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognisable from the outside, as they differ in different finishing facade.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was shaped with boards, the part where the office is kept in white and the remaining elements remained in the clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, which makes the interior of the house very intertwined with the exterior.
The parents' household, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The interconnection of the interior with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues up to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climb the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall cascadingly through them.
It was by this that the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique to it.
The young couple's household is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room combined.
It is separated from the terrace by a glass wall with a sliding door.

The second floor is composed as one large open space that passes freely to the terrace, where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office on the top floor itself is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant feature of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance, find themselves in the lobby and then climb the stairs up the stairs.
Fire crews arrived to rescue the lost puppy, which was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous outcropping in the quarry
The Kokrš spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, trapped in a quarry, he was spotted by a man walking the dog.
Firefighters rappel down the cliff face to rescue the dog from certain death.
The puppy was freed by fire-fighting units that came to rescue it after somehow imprisoning itself on a dangerous outcropping in a stonework 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days himself until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson (25), and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, they frantically searched for their lost dog and posted the calls on social networks.
On Wednesday at about 2:15 p.m. he saw a blushdock dog-walker stranded with a curd in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station hurried to the scene and rappel down to free Ruby, using the pet's transport bag to retrieve the rock.
The technical rescue team's expert commander, Andy Clayton, said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall - 15 metres from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't flinch like a flinch - he was totally frozen.
He's fine now.
He then got the cookies.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.
The technical rescue team's expert commander, Peter Lau, said, "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a tour, and apart from exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was afraid to look at the rescue."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him back in his arms.
The vet said that if he had exhausted himself and collapsed, he would probably have fallen.
The firemen did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just huge.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
Firefighters were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
The refrigeration tower was burned at the ČKD industrial site in Prague at night
A large-capacity magazine was on fire in the industrial site of ČKD in Prague, according to the fire department, apparently a cooling tower.
"Firefighters were driving to the fire on the fire before 11 p.m. on Thursday, and they were still putting out the fire this morning," Prague Fire Department spokeswoman Pavlína Adamcová said.
The amount of pollutants in the air around as measured did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the cause of the fire are as yet unknown.
Approximately five dozen firefighters arrived at the compound in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire in a large-capacity reservoir, probably a cooling tower," Adamcová said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we extinguish with a transport line from the tanks," she said.
According to tn.cz, the extinguishing was complicated by a malfunctioning network of hydrants, so firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The firefighter's intervention commander issued a second level of fire alarm.
There are four in total, the most serious situations are announced in the fourth.
Chemists also rushed to the scene to verify the level of hazardous substances that could have been airborne in the fire.
"However, they did not measure in the air a number of pollutants that would be beyond hygiene standards," the fire department spokesperson said.
Rescue package worth $325 million for Tasmania's health service
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the moruranating health service in Tasmania contains tough conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersekova announced that the Australian Union was making "anchin of measures" to avert the crisis caused by the island's aging population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided following government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilki.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The package of $325 million contains $31 million for surgeries at the request of the patient.
A further 2600 operations including orthopedic operations and cataract surgery will help to remove the indebtedness.
There is also money for free-access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operational care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to thoughts that leading clinicians told me to help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," Ms Plibersecková said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting and registration obligation regime.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the money of the Australian Union and report on the monthly where the additional funding was spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State supplies services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will be of no use, "as the last time a genuine reform is followed to lay down a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for swiftly aid, which he first made in negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal auxiliary package can free state-run public health care from a critical state," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional procedures will be significantly reversed by recent cuts.
The federal health opposition spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes today's statement is just a "proprio."
"The reason for me here is that the Labour government has removed $430 million from our health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes away almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union, which is donating $300 million to, and to pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Ms Plibersecko to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package would be issued for a higher bureaucracy.
On the subway on the Bridge, there is music
The transport company of the capital.m. (DPP) of Prague launched the project Music on the Metro.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during the metro operation, is the A Bridge of Line on the Climb to the Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghetto, to ease the tension
Police specialists should be active in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half their errands here.
They would keep an eye on the order and solve problems.
Through their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from impoverished places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Interior Ministry envisages this.
According to him, the situation in the country would be helped mainly by "fatured provision of social housing" to improve the situation.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 shantytowns and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, mainly Roma.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
She was a weight.
According to experts in the problem locations, meanwhile, the added 100 has been added.
Relationships between their people and the others are escalating.
In several places, anti-Romani marches were held.
The extremists were joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the Interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
A crucial condition, he said, was "the consistent application of equal access in law enforcement."
But this is said to be impossible to achieve without detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
A specialist would go to errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest he would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee the order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better deal with problems or offences.
"Thanks to the established confidence, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a wide range of infringements," the Interior said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive bonuses, at between 500 and 1,000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers to the problem areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (about $15.5 million now).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations have started this year, a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbours.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the report's authors said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to be given by analysis to determine where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year for these members after the end of the project.
According to the project's design, the selected police officers will first undergo an internship in Slovakia.
Five dozen members should undergo this training a year.
They will produce the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special education for police officers who will be active in the ghettos.
According to the authors, the situation would be helped mainly by social housing.
It should, he said, motivate and lead to integration.
According to the Interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with strictly defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be given to social housing that would be comparable to normal housing.
The Tenants would have to carry out an integration plan to be drawn up by social workers.
They would have to adhere to the accommodation regulations, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate, they would go to a higher standard of housing.
The permeable housing system should work for at least 30 years, according to the Interior, until the next generation grows "in a pro-integration-driven environment."
The social housing model is being prepared by the local development and labour departments.
They're supposed to propose it by the end of the year.
Together with Barta, the inspection arrested the inspection and the anti-corruption police analyst
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was reported by the news server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon discovered that the case was taken in the charge of the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS), its people were to arrest Bárta in the center of Prague.
It took place outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection addresses cases where the accused are police officers, but its authority also applies to civil persons.
According to MF DNES, among those arrested, one of the anti-corruption police officers - the head of analysts and computer science, Jan Petržílek - is among those arrested.
He has worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej, however, declined to comment with the implication that the media must turn to GIBS on the matter.
But even her inspection spokeswoman, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, promptly referring to the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified information," said the spokesperson of the prosecutor's office, Štěpánka Zenklová.
Also, from this unspecific response, it can be inferred that the event took place, but it is in a regime of secrecy that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
Bárt's lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "even on this matter," but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bart's arrest.
Some media first speculated that Barta's arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
He was promoted to the post by Barta, together with former VV President Radek John, who was at the head of the Interior Ministry.
The dispute, which spramira was spraheic about this, was also spraherifed between ex-Prime Minister Petr Nečas Nečas and VV, even to be resolved by then-President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from on my person.
I wasn't contacted, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about the matter," Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially pushed through by Radek John, but Barta was the real head of the party at the time.
Barta was now running for the Dawn election, only narrowly missing his seat - by 175 votes.
Dawn's leader, Tomio Okamura, said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Bárta was one of many of the candidates of many of the parties on our ticket and, as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy, Tomio Okamura," he distanced himself from Bárta, who said before the election that he gave Bárta the space to run for the Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of bailiffs.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former running mate from VV, Jaroslav Škárka.
Foreign visa-ayed workers may undergo a "legal" test
As the government intends to extend the police crackdown, it is considering a "lawfulness" test for foreign workers with a visa authorisation 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 from being used to fulfil unqualified jobs or as a back door for the relocation of family and friends to Australia.
When a government debate article was issued today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The loud statements 'aest for the end of the queue' and 'work first for Australians' are a very unpleasant remnant remnant from the time when the unions demanded a protected labour market," she told the Australian-Indic Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the white labor force was to be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone in this region had heard the echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article discusses the 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is in talks with officials for human smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest are left to consider.
If the criteria of "lawfulness" are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether "the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or the relevant person sponsoring the business."
After previous experience with businesses that have intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka seeking asylum has died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a Christmas Islands as a sasun to the Asylum Ship this week.
The man's nine-year-old frightened son was travelling to Australia with him, and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on a boat on the boat after his father's death on Wednesday.
The Australian authorities and the man rushed to the hospital on the Christmas Islands where he died.
Israeli military aircraft attacked target in Syria, said responsible official
Israeli military aircraft hit the target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, a responsible official for the administration confirmed to Fox News.
This responsible official did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the target of the Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice before this year, Israel carried out an aerial attack on missile shipments in Syria.
From the villa she moved to a block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a tenancy in a building villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of Prague's nicest villa districts in Ořechovka.
The original owners of the house, however, got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance package.
Ivana was therefore quickly looking for alternative housing for herself and her then older mother.
From acquaintances she received a tip for apartment 3 + kk in an older prefab house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to the extensive forest park and dam got me excited on the other side," Ivana recalls of the first impression.
At first I thought it was going to be a makeshift for, like, three years.
"We have lived here today for more than thirteen years and not only for the gradual reconstruction I would not change," the owner adds.
At the time, the mother and daughter were moving from a hundred-deter-tweter apartment to a smaller apartment with an area of 62 m2 and gave out almost all the equipment.
The action was not easy, the items were stored with friends, and the gradual arrangements took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary modifications had to be made, such as door painting or window replacement.
The previous owner crashed the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hall, and a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to define the individual zones and subdivision of the room, which allowed for a new placement of the lights.
The first intervention she had committed to in a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout to 2 + kk, but the room got to the airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to partially improving the standard was to replace the PVC floor for the laminate.
With the bathroom, Ivana didn't know what to do.
For years, I've been subsiring housing magazines and looking for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step for the future," says Ivana.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, the available hall was also adapted at the same time.
The architect joined the toilet and bathroom space, replacing two doors with the opening wings with some slides, saving the space.
The bathroom is timeless and also wheelchair accessible.
High-quality tiles imitate sandstone, plus a comfortable seat is in the shower, a bidet shower at the toilet.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douděrová continued on.
As part of the show How to Build a Dream, a quick but crucial transformation of the living room took place, which also involved the architect Martin Čeněk.
In the space, which was created by the combination of two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, residential and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical partition, such as half-tical or Japanese walls.
"This would ultimately violate the openness and unity of the space," the architect explains.
It was originally possible to separate the sleeping and living areas.
All you had to do was turn back two sofa in and put a custom-made blanket box between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and the painting.
On the kitchen and dining area floor, the architect used a high-quality marmoleum, the sliding door she brought the sliding door to life with a pattern wallpaper.
The kitchenette is covered by sliding panels with wallpaper when needed.
The new anti-allergic marmolea floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate: a softer unclaid surface without seams and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and sub-opholes from the plasterboard highlighted in the colour is a demonstration of how to work with space in the block of flats.
I left the colours to the architects, I wished it would be joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in my previous apartment," says Ivana.
The cladding of the graphoscope with a film-blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone, the architects chose a white one that underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, the books were also placed in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably operated remotely.
The redesigned interior features an excellent contrast of the new elder, for example with decades-old crystal chandelier as well as high-quality art objects that Ivana collects all her life.
The kitchen was the last one.
The cabinets had previously been placed on either side, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect took away their number and rearrope the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is custom-made, the white area softens the slightly pearl surface.
The small space was accommodathed thanks to the imaginative solution of the washing machine, the dryer and the dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen was revived by the all-glass wall cladding above the worktop.
The unique graphonskis with a digitally printed theme is attractive, and it is also very well maintained.
Ivana chose the magnolium flowers that remind her of the popular neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here, too.
The original bathroom had a small bathtub and a sink, and the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cladding.
The large shower has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to make the environment a clear, simple space in which the functions and equipment would be in harmony.
We unified the interior in material and colour and attempted to make its elegant, cozy, not overly crowded look.
"A barrier-free solution was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of objects of daily use," adds Kamila Douděrová.
Minister Holcát reinstated the role of Main Sister for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalised, so that the nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, the Minister of Health.
I respect the work of the nurses, and I think that the field of nursing deserving deserves to be given due consideration by the Ministry as well.
The profession requires not only a high professional professionalism, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I'm going to try, in all due care, to pursue those steps that can improve the nurses' position."
"We have excellent and skilful nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us much with their approach to patients to perform their calling with all their empathy and help us improve the image of the sisters in the public eye," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Main Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also said on the occasion of her appointment that she wanted to deal with various aspects of the nurse's position and intended to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, emerging, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I don't want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing side by side, with everyone having their own competencies and, together with other healthcare professionals, forming a well-matched work team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties, and I intend to be involved in solving them."
These include, for example, ensuring a simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of the nurse unnecessarily burdens and take away the time they could and should devote to patients instead," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas he intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding paths for better cooperation in the team and with the management of health service providers, the regulation of competences, as well as employment issues such as respect for the Labour Code or not overloading the nurses's under-eminigining their insufficient number in time and place.
We often hear anonymous nicks, but for fear of possible sanction, they are not documented on a specific case where violations could occur.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the function of the Main Sister of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee in this case the anonymity of such a complaint and have a specific case examined by the relevant authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Health Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study programme Nursing - Pedagogy (she graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has served as the head of the nursing and other non-medical fields and the recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a bedside nurse in the internal ward, as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several scholarly nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, and devoted herself to lecturing in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted Denis Diderot's novel, which brings an exceptional film quest and a rendering of the time, but is also more boring than it should have been.
It unfolds in France in the 1860s and tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to a monastery by her family.
When he rebel, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from the reprehensibly degenerate mother of the presenter, and for another, he becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slides into a snooty or sensationalism, and that's its problem.
The resighell of this story leads to the viewers also experiencing an ached-like wearing of a horsehair shirt.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big jump - a jump back a few years, to my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash the dishes, vacuum and do your homework.
Although these "dwires," it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of the parents.
Practice was very different - to come running from school, to throw the bag in the corner and run out.
Playing ball games with the other kids, jumping a shot.
Then, on the show, Helena and her boys, with a chain-stitch stitch, a solemn tablecloth for her grandmother's birthday.
And then, after several notifications, to finally wash the dishes, vacuum, to fetch the wood to the tiled stove in the winter and do the tasks after dark under the lamp (or to rely on a classmate and instead of to do their homeworking verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, eat homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, the contents of which were not even lying next to the strawberries) and to drink it with a souvenge from the dried herbs that my mother and I were so happy to collect.
I also remember the magic evenings when the deathly silence in the nursery was when my sister's sings were uploaded by the radio to the cassettes that were loudly in the old tape recorder by my mom.
And then we rewelled the cassettes on the pencil and played one of the same songs over and over and over, our favorite, and toasted with a siphon.
Or we phoned across the table using cans that were tied with string - and while we're on the phone call to be better heard, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, the earl was a match + wit.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live on it so that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation, and the best "bun" in the wardrobe was a batik home-made T-shirt using SAVA.
From the electronics, the aforementioned mom's cassette was enough to us to be satisfied, and to the maximum, the Walkman we shared with our sister, which, by the way, we used only on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Kloboučka Hop or Man, Don't be mad, or as I've already said, to go "just out."
When I was a little older, we got a video recorder under the tree, surely the parents saved for it for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't warm up with us for a long time.
My younger sister stuffed the strudel in him, said to have cheated the tapes so beautifully, so she tried to see if she was sleeping a strudel.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, this episode is still on his dad's plate today, poor man.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she shipped the strudel in the video and thought she would play it with a recipe and not play it, so he still can't bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate with each other, to talk without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I agreed on holiday with a neighbor's granddaughter at my grandmother's, when we'll meet again next summer at my grandmother's house - and that's the way it was, that's the way it was.
We're gathered.
Promise now with someone you'll see you in a year?!
I also remember the winter, when we ran out with the whole village, built snowmen, rode the snowmills on the snow-covered hill by the church on bags stuffed with h h h hay.
Then the whole family and I dined together and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I heard the notorious phrase before each dinner: "Being wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but you certainly don't have the tap-linked soap in the lemons' net.
After dinner, when my dad "worked" in the garage over a beer with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay down on the floor, rested our legs against a tiled stove, opened the door and looked at the flame, and listened to the crackle of the wood that had been coming from the stone.
We were closer - really - not counting how many friends we had on the social networking site, knowing how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't write messages daily through various cottages, SMS messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew far more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at albums where they are neatly glued to the black-and-white black-and-white photos.
And in case I didn't know how old I was then, from the back of the photo it's always the year of the picture to take.
I am looking to see that although the pot-creation haircuts didn't suit us very well and we had our pants two sizes bigger after our cousin, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better go back that step forward - to reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting to see what the modern age will come up with for, say, one day for my children.
What I do know for sure is that these memories of mine are now, for the younger adolescents, at least somewhere "a century behind the monkeys" and I think they're missing a lot that they won't experience this "pre-sic," either.
I'd like them to!
They must save, the young Czechs know.
But most of them don't even know with what interest rates
More Czechs are putting their money aside.
Still, they fall short of the region's savings champions.
The most money is being deposited by Austrians, who save an average of €181 a month.
A little more than Czechs, people in Slovakia are also saving.
This is according to a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer group in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, and two-thirds of respondents plan to set aside more money.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still make very little use of saving products.
For example, almost every other Serb saves at home "under the pillow" at home, according to the survey.
Domestically, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has risen this year.
As recently as last year, 26 percent of respondents put off between 1,000 and 2.5 thousand crowns each month for a variety of savings, up five percent this year.
However, the average monthly deposit fell slightly to CZK 2078 year-on-year.
The biggest hit among savings products is the pension insurance.
This is favoured by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to value savings for only 36 percent of people.
Conversely, the popularity of building savings is declining, and interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly compared to last year.
Only 16 percent of respondents already use these, compared to almost a quarter of people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns they make on individual products.
Young people under 30 in particular do not know how their money is remunerated.
Conversely, the earliest awareness of the return on their money saved is the oldest group, with 73 per cent of respondents aware of the best awareness of the return on the return public.
In an international comparison of the Erste group, Czechs lead online banking, which is regularly used by 44 per cent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with 12% detachment.
Australian woman appeals to stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island when she falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially charged with the Land District Court on the island of Phuket on June 15 for perjury when she told the Thai police that the taxi driver, along with two other men who were holding her, attacked her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, a footage from an industrial television later revealed that after she had broken up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Police from the island of Phuket conducted interviews with Bamford for two days before confessing to making up the story.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 in prison at a low-security correctional facility on the Phuket periphery instead of being placed in adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canbera for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney-Dadney Sunday Telegraph that the entire family had "extreme concerns" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It's a challenging time, we think, but we hope he'll be back to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia say she was spending her holidays in the Krabi recreation area in the south of Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but was said to have been warned that the appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in placement in adult prison.
However, following the recent assassination of the Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to correct the damaged picture for tourists, which may have just been behind the acquittal verdict.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
The lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Cologne Municipal Social House not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the programme Between Us singers Lenka Nova, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Matěj Benko.
After the opening intro and acting etuda about the delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, came alone with a candle in his hand, recalling the story of how they last played in Cologne and the theatre and the whole city was electrocuted.
"Otherwise in Cologne they made two types of cards that I came in contact with a lot of," he recalled.
He also recalled the native of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of the Zákolany or Dúbravka u Bratislava," he quipped about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horacek, who had not left the stage and, if he had not spoken, sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical feat.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, but at the time he had no idea about how we meet in those squares and chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech Calendar, but we won't play it here for you here today," he amused.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this record for him a very suitable Sleep in the day, sing at night and accompanied himself to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percussion, with all three singers accompanying the band in the composition of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
The three vocalists together sang a little bit of a rip-over To the Slope of the Heat, a sits that immediately sprared the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded afterwards.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, I heard I'm in the performance of František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with huge applause, Hana Heger was reminded of the song Dad liked Lída Baarová with Horáček's explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baarová by the American actress Mae West.
Composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the song Sebastián, Segrado then sang a gorgeous piece of Prague set to music by Jarda Svoboda, a cage native and former Kolíňák.
But it was the end, the applause standing and the encore in the form of an optimistic piece We Live in a Beautiful Time.
There was another encore for the playlist, but the fans didn't get a back out.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four sat at the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the cover from the legendary LP and with prospective buyers, she took a photo.
Recently, the CEO of CEZ announced that he was postponing the decision to build the 3rd and 4th units of the Temelín power plant until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Policy and by agreeing the Contracts difference of the government.
With these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to delegate its responsibility to the government - that is, for the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should give the shareholder a recommendation, not hide behind him.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest because of parental leave program
Billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest because of a parental leave programme because his daughters can become pregnant and benefit from it.
The Mining Magnate, who is in dispute over the reimbursement of a $6 million coal tax assessment, made the claim when he tried to take the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate that play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be in a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policies.
"He's been in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters become pregnant, he would have a direct interest in getting parental leave," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission, after recounting the votes, officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the race for the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast area with a gain of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polling stations are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately, and get the results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to label ballots.
The point is, the results can be excreheted if someone doesn't like it?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission studied electronic voting opportunities and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his political agenda also applied to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job "very seriously."
The Public Office is a public service.
"We are not looking for any reward except to serve society at this critical time," he said.
The new Civil Code is being prepared for six companies out of ten
The impending effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act has been intensively being prepared for six out of ten companies since 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the company representatives surveyed said they had not addressed the issues related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This is according to a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the upcoming deadline for the effectiveness of the two key codes, a number of managers are only now beginning to realise at the last minute what a significant effect they can have on their companies' business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the lamentation of politicians, the business sector has long been in the insecurity of whether revolutionary changes will eventually take place or not.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks to have the switch to the new right to take place without complications for their companies," commented partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively dealing with the new codes, 26 percent said their firms had already taken all the necessary measures to be ready in time.
In addition, 35 per cent of companies of this number are about to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, one in five companies has not yet addressed the recodifications, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and are unable to assess the issue.
Only eight per cent of companies admit that the issues associated with the recodifications have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the largest number of companies surveyed, with new contracts being for the largest number of companies surveyed (21 per cent), followed by a solution to the terms and conditions (16 per cent) and changes in the Land Register and in liability for damage (after 10 percent).
Contracts will take place one of the most important novelties of the entire recodification, namely the unification of contract adjustments only under the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in both the Civil and Commercial Curs will lapse, with the result that the contract law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom of organizing relationships," said Lukáš Poddaný, attorney at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In the context of the Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies see the issue of increasing the liability of the statutory bodies as the most important issue.
This is followed by themes on changes in the convening and conduct of the general meeting (15 per cent) and representing the company (14 per cent).
The new legislation means tightening up the obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially when a company is at risk of bankruptcy or reaches.
"In practice, this means that if the board members and the company's agents do not act with the care of a proper treasurer and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may not lose the benefit of the acquired office for the last two years," Spáčil said.
NSA revelation increases social paranoia of state surveillance
On a peaceful day towards the end of August, a German police helicopter was buzzing at the US Consular Office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the instruction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the US forward-sun patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media claim that the BfV Office hoped to be able to identify the presence of listening antenna, and the event launched an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, the US Director of National News, insisted again that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profit."
But ever since Edward Snowden, who became an associate of an informant, began to unveil his valuable collection from the United States' undercover surveillance, European governments, and leading businessmen no longer know if to believe the director's words.
After reports that the US National Security Agency was conducting espionage at a Brazilian oil company and gaining access to data available to US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, general paranoia about state-run tracking of new dimensions has reached general paranoia about state-based surveillance.
The last straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was perhaps tapped for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the potential targets and the leading entrepreneurial players are certainly.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between US intelligence services and companies in a transparent make-entric.
I would say that it is possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, a company that represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey issued in July by the EY consultancy service, German companies believe that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much of a risk as China.
However, the entire documentation revealed by Mr Snowden is not yet evidence that the United States was handing over the trade secrets of foreign firms to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concerns that the EU lacked some IT and internet capabilities and said it should seek to limit its US dependence:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German parliament that we should make the German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them slowly...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the American spy agencies uncovered by Snowden is still shocking to some companies, who have thought that China was the biggest threat of surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have become more aware that the data stored in the US is under the jurisdiction there and are therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance business community, around 10 percent of non-American members, following the US Prism data mining revelations, cancelled plans to use a cloud provider based in the US.
Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs of SAP, says, "Do we have a new question for customers that wasn't here a year ago - where is my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction?"
Many German senior officials argue that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: that the powerful states want to alienate their most precious secrets, and this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
"This has been a major issue for many years and has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the agrochemical company BASF.
The Americans are conducting espionage on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we do espionage on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally don't want to boast about the countermeasures they've made to potentially not give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free memory USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi's board of directors, says it has been a common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting to prevent them from being used as a listening device.
The German BfV office advises executives to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
"Mothers often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrecy against an unauthorised approach," the BfV warns in its report.
The US warns its own company against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington, in February, US National Intelligence Estimate documents listed France, alongside Russia and Israel, in the second row of perpetrators involved in the hacking activity for economic correspondents, in front of China.
A board member in a German risk-free society concluded that, as far as economic espionage was concerned, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France's internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in one of the interviews this month: "Sollies know quite well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are conducting espionage on their allies."
New nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human trials, you need to run more tests that take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We very much hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong to overcome all current approaches," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry the genetic information for the creation of anti-inicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antitolents chase all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from taking a nicotine hit.
In the tests of the vaccinated mice, which were additionally supplied with nicotine, continued their normal activities.
But the mice that weren't vaccinated, "squitified," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injection had to be administered frequently to maintain sufficient antibody levels, so they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody-making factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for people, they could be given to children before they want to try a cigarette, avoiding nicotine addiction.
But it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't have any enjoyment of it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that'll help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but point out that further research is needed.
The desperate cry of Obama's voter
I voted for Obama twice - I shared the hope of a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts were derailed by the Republican Party's obstruction
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the woes of Obama's healthcare website or unmanned aircraft attacks
The memores of the Obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a year of med school at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought of this book, in the gloomy days of my second year of medical school, I would be encouraged and restored in me by a shred of hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and these are memories of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish the patients' assessments in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and the speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelmingly, and the TV coverage made us reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents kept the newspapers they could get.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And this is where I'm closing the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It's hard to remember these optimistic days - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I threw down my first ballot, there were indeed changes.
It was certainly none of the most I had imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements – from the Affordable Care Act to the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the "no question, say nothing" policy after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party's obstruction has reversed so much of an effort to move our nation forward: immigration reform, the possibility of the public choosing health care and closing the Guantánamo base.
But after many situations in which I have defended the Obama administration from my colleagues and comrades, I have reached an absolute limit when it comes to the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the approval to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or the drone raids that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by them that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the private lives of Americans, or that it is persecuting those who expose the government's incorrect actions.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a proper trial, or for limiting public contributions and expenses during the presidential campaigns.
It is impossible to justify the discovery of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "most aggressive ... from the Nixon administration."
And most recently, they can't even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after the signing of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if such a thing was to be expected.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government power could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The election position is clearly not predictable, and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to the extent to be the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbroud, and he seemed unable to consolidate his policies or position.
I had the feeling that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we had once heard of.
Yet a return to 2008 – with Obama's support to fall below 45% this week – is increasingly difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the series of promises that have faded away.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At the extra campaign meeting, he told his staff that he had to get back to speed and remain loyal to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I agree with you.

ŠkoFIN's business and marketing is run by Abraham
Its remits include the product and marketing sector and the strengthening of cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Ludek Šantor.
Abrahamek has joined the car industry with the automotive sector for the last 14 years of his professional career.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, subsequently at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the brand and dealers Alfa Romeo for seven years.
His last job was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was created in 1992.
Syria has destroyed its means for the production of chemical weapons, says oversawing authority
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition, the Global Chemicals Supervision Committee said on Thursday, while violent conflicts erupted in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where poisonous substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian activist group said that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
a term set by this organisation, based in The Hague, set for Damascus to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons and machinery for the blitting of chemicals to create poison gas and fill ammunition.
Completing this essentially initial phase of destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2015.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
But Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
This country is believed to have about 1 000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as the fighting raged on Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts refer to as the headquarters of both the chemical weapons and repositories factory, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, said, based in Britain.
A group of activists that monitored the total number of casualties through a network of activists in Syria reported that 120,962 people had died on Thursday.
Of this, 61,067 are to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Among those killed are also expected to be 2,220 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN organization estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced the population of about 2 million to leave the country.
Assad's troops have been battling the rebels in Safira, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaeda, for weeks.
Observable on Thursday said the losses were on both sides but did not have specific figures.
The fighting underscored the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who, in their mission to get rid of the chemical arsenal of chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war, have to deal with the narrow deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which is working closely with the UN, it was said that his team was now "a satisfied that it has verified - and monitored the destruction - of Syria's declared crucial equipment for production and semipeminate/fullings."
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned."
Previously this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification works when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two locations due to safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW reported that the two sites had been "admitted and ... the items in the chemical weapons programme it contained have been moved to two other declared sites that have been checked," according to Syria.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I bow to the courage and bravery that you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission that this organization has ever had," observers' director Ahmet Uzumc said in his commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government, with their security forces, are facing each other in the civil war, which are full of members of the Alawit sect, an offshoots of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the Observers' Monitoring Rami, Abdul Rahman, said that on Wednesday there was a powerful explosion inside an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lázikiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
"Today we are witnessing a milestan: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in his statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of the Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, say officials.
Miller says that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "always" removed.
As soon as the project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says the construction is expected to begin in other countries in the direction of the flow at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Early puberty: Adult to the Early
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanics reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes don't mean puberty
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind it
Experts say one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an obesity epidemic.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in the boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in the health of children and family problems.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start to grow at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Physicians this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I've spent a lot of time assuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic hair on ohanic and under the armpits and body odor, appear in girls earlier.
Over the last forty years, however, there has been little shift at the age of the first menstruation.
In the United States, it is now a mediocre age of 12.5 years, compared to the age of 12.75, in 1970.
"When breast boobs start to develop, a minimum of two to three years will pass before the first menstruation occurs," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (Time Bobsleum in Girls: The Injunct for Making Up to This Freemon Problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is the time.
Discussions are discussed for what activates the actual start of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered to be "prematurely mature."
In most cases, the process is slowed down or stopped – which can be closely monitored by pedigre practitioners.
Faster growth may be a reason for the endocrinologist to carry out tests to avoid serious problems such as a tumor or a cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to a halt to growth and stundust in adulthood.
Recommendations on medications and hormone treatment are dependent on the child's age, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
The psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that "suppression of puberty can alleviate the girl's behavioral problems and her feelings that they are different from their peers."
Understandable is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have their period.
"They're worried he might get pregnant, or how he's going to handle the hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to be menstrual at the age of 10.
Although there were signs of indication and we spoke about menstruation, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends's.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, environment chemicals or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys - like girls - reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason is an obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped carry out a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9 that combines body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations vary.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are already at a young age in the face's pubic hair and on the bud, the trend towards the full bloom of early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Children's Physicians' Association (AAP) added additional complexities to the subject.
Acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their paediatrician on how to speak to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the child sooner than you'd like to assume," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will probably respond well.
Girls who develop before need assurances that even if it does so prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanon's Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the Kalamún mountainous region.
According to the still-releasing reports, Israel in Wednesday's raids on two locations in western Syria destroyed the missiles designated by Hezhbaly.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of its army.
Its agenda is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfin with the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of weaponry to Hezbollah's hands to Lebanon.
News of Wednesday's Israeli airstriels on arms depots in western Syria is yet to be specified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but was confirmed by U.S. sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabíja news station claims that two warehouses were hit in which the rockets were ready to be taken to Lebanon.
According to its sources, they were Russian-made missiles SA-8.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria was continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles, and the Syrian air force was teaching the members of the Hezbollah armed section to handle the missiles.
The SA-8 are outdated missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are mounted on the moving chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, it is easy to hide thanks to its mobility and small size.
They are equipped with radar, but it shuts down after the missile is fired, so it is difficult to lock on.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling alávita.
This is a well-a-guised area and Hezbollah has participated in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He says he helps protect the Syrian Shiite community to which the Alai belongs.
Now, reportedly, the 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help conquer the army back to the Kalamún.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalamún lies between Damascus and the country's third largest city, Homs.
The battle, according to al-Aabiy's source, is in retaliation for the opposition's recent attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Shiite Brigade, Abu Fadla Abbas, in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to fight the back of the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusajr had just gone to Kalamún.
In it, he argues that Maliki has a large part in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly the work of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
For the ČSSD, Sobotka is negotiating.
Social democracy is crumbling, the people and the grandmothers are talking to each other and are preparing a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats are topped up in a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly well-matched partners who will put a ready list of demands, including ministerial posts, on the table.
The ČSSD's ambassadors will then either swallow the sour coalition grapes or agree to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka first came across after four days of being a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to take control of the political board and, above all, force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party so far is only him, with the other team members only allowed after a crucial meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the board and now to the citizens.
You're not supposed to be lying, in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hašek, said after the meeting of the Social Democrat's inner leadership.
He added that he did not cling to the post of First Vice-President.
"I will make my decision on 10 November at the Central Court," said Hasek.
The deputy chairman of the ČSSD, Zdeněk Škromach, and the head of the deputy club, Jeroným Tejc, spoke similarly.
He pointed out, however, that he had been elected only two days earlier.
Both MPs then said they would do everything they could to make the 50-member ČSSD club sounding with one voice.
Michal Hašek put the crown on the absurd theatre with the sentence: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities."
So another lie on live television.
Or did he forget, in the call to Sobotka's resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team, that the ÚVV in August, with 57 percent, decided that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party's candidate for prime minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, by convening the ÚVVV, made a powerful army of enemies until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of the 1919 members of this body and the media with a collection of various gossipes and rumors, or to recall the real flaws of Sobotka's political career.
There will be powerfully laundry to wash, there will be hints of a dark alliance between the coal baron Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential attorney Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
They are drocked by disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD.
The words of the mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka's ally, Petr Kajnar, are a warning: "I signed Charter 77 to prevent the country from being ruled by idiots."
Had the DOJ met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritual sacrifice of their functions.
Traitors sprinkle their heads with the oat.
And the currently winning ČSSD chief will then end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
UN celebrates new goals for fighting poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work without delay on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDG, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
Speaking at the summit overnight, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said it was now time to "get over national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to introduce the general sustainable development targets - the SDGs," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Babiš: The Cabin only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in opposition and that it will have to go straight to the government to create one at all.
The president of ANO admitted this in an interview with Právo, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin promised an environmental Olympics, plan to be hatched by giant secret landfills
Winter sports fans are already cutting a meter by the start of the Sochi Olympics, while others are looking at their preparations with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, though not starting until February, is facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be failing to deliver on the promise that the preparation and hosting of the Games will not in the slightest disturb nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
Indeed, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high bar, with the Canadian Games making the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
But he seems to have taken on Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to hold "nulle waste" games a long time ago.
AP reporters last week discovered a giant landfill of building materials in the village of Achishtyr, near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulation foams was found by environmentalists in August, which was immediately reported.
Russian authorities are kal for the falsis and the landfill has disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters presented a view of a landfill the size of three football pitches.
It is not the only one, several of them have been created in the area of such places, the British newspaper The Times described.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly that is building a roughly 60-kilometre route between Sochi Airport and a sports resort, is working on the site.
The business, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways were prevented from setting up the landfill by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
According to experts, the waste is at risk of contaminating the local Mzymta River, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates the Soc water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental nonprofit EWNC told the British newspaper.
The illegal landfills are not the only problem with the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
By comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics cost $43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and the aforementioned vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and worry about whether there would be enough snow in the end, there were also reports that human rights were not respected when working on the sports and infrastructure exhibitions.
Last month, one of the workers' mouths was shaped in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers will grapple with a new law during the Games that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gay men at the Olympics.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will have to continue to switch off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landings, even regardless of changes in the US to relax the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies the space to change their procedures, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in the "air" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot have access to their e-books during take-off and landings.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on the aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that the passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from the crew.
Virgin, which had already spoken to CASA about the extension of the use of its on-board entertainment system, was in favor of the change but announced that it would undergo a decision by the regulator.
"We would welcome CASA to analyse the permission to use electronic devices because we really think that it would improve the experience of customers now (wireless in-flight entertainment), when we have," the spokesman said.
Qantas announced that it would stick to the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon," he said.
The FAA rules apply to American airlines.
But we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly study the FAA's decisions and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will be different from the company to the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio cancellations of mobile phones, as well as revising manuals, training material, hand luggage programmes and passenger information.
"Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to turn off the device during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stored under the seats or in the overhead storage area during take-off and descent.
The nonsense in Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the universe of Gravity sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic for some time after its premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by nearly 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews view the picture positively.
Others, however, find certain inconsistencies.
Lidovky.cz asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films that I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity included, even if it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it too much.
You might notice Sandra Bullock's hair, which somehow doesn't come in weightlessness.
The Hubb's Space Telescope and the International Space Stations move in markedly different orbiting, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistically acting effect and the whole behaviour of the fire in weightlessness.
The suits, they said, would also not last such wounds.
Heroes in Gravity often collize with various objects, and suits can withstand it without much difficulty.
Criticism was not spared the plot either.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, according to some debaters.
In addition, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to correct the technique.
People argue in the forums about the "unreal" behaviour of the ropes.
It is said to make it seem to be intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Observatory and Planetarium of the Capital City of Prague): I have only seen it on a wide screen so far, but I can say unequivocally, I have been enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, it was science fiction.
And for such a story, the author has the right (almost duty) not to be consistently held up to reality.
"More than the discrepancy you mentioned, I was touched by the three times as shown by a space station with a degrading level of technology (most recently Chinese)."
"Chínská will be in the end of the decade, after all, and will probably look better than it is in the film."
Vladimír Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in not breaking the laws of physics, and so the natural-leaning viewer appreciates that the moment of momentum, in the vocabulary of physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is quite right to preserve the moment of momentum, also the view on the Earth from the universe, including the thin skin of the atmosphere and the aurorag flicker on the polar regions.
Irregularities will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
Additionally, for example, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of the various cosmic trash in orbit appears in reverse in some scenes than should be these (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators adapted to their needs, but I did not record any essential and blatant transgression against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of a similar focus, you can see that the creators took care of the credibility of the events depicted.
From moments that make no sense to name the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in an otherwise downtroit orbit than the ISS.
The result is a significantly different mutual speed and the rescue operation could therefore not actually be done as it was shown in the film.
Then, at the moment of the Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) department, I didn't notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there is no clear origin of the power acting on Kowalski, which forces the two players to go on at the moment they are no longer moving towards each other.
Bombardier's profit plummeted as a result of a drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, due to fewer orders and shipments of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release any data on the air test for its new aircraft of the type CSeries, nor did it offer up-to-date information on whether the aircraft would underline the ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next September.
After the opening test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times, and the question arose as to whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not meet their estimates, and shares fell 8 percent on the Toronto stock exchange.
State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded his rating on Thursday from "higher return" to "performance of the sector," with the expectation that the stock market would experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While we mostly expected smaller shipments of aircraft, the profit margin in the field of transport has been significantly disappointed by us," Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the trial program proceeds, we believe that Bombardier will acquire new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market's scepticism to the programme to rise.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries-type aircraft will fight their way into the lower market area now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was detected in March and the first flight took place in September after a delay of several months.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177 as potential buyers are waiting for the results of a test flight to verify the company's low-consumption claims and savings on the cost of this transport aircraft.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and liabilities from 15 customers and operators.
Managing director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to achieve its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
Leadership officials also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in the conference call, noting that the ground-based rehearsal and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did that.
This will happen throughout the flight schedule.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the others not long after.
Still, the analysts are sceptical about the first customer being able to start operating a CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims to have been in stocking the aircraft's operational plan and providing updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight testing – even though it is in line with Bombardier's internal plan - is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
From USD 172 million or 9 cents per share the previous year, Bombardier' net profit fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending on 30 September.
Adjusted returns per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The bill fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Under Thomson Reuters' IBES system, analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered only 45 aircraft aircraft during the quarter, compared to the 57 aircraft the year before.
Net orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aerial division accounted for 32.9 billion as of 30 September, which is unchanged by 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our projections, but the low order reception and the overall state of the market disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
Yield in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said the revenue in the division rose almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts accounted for 32.6 billion as of 30 September, a marginal growth from 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Leaders said new outlooks would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares in Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google's finance director, Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.53/83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the company's closest competitor to Bombardier, announced a 10% fall in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Mick Jagger claims he definitely didn't leave after the then 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview with the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that she sang the backing vocals for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" for Jagger's song.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he came out at her.
And she added, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very kind to me."
In a Thursday statement, a representative (70) said he categorically denied that he had ever made Katy Perry's proposals.
The representative said, "Maybe he's confusing with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers (spěček) who appeared on the Rolling Stones' concert tour this year.
Her new album, "Prism," debuted in the first place this week.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"This is a frightening message and it is fair to ask what will prevent parliament from simply sweating the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper said, deeming the bill to be unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extended hand of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to the Star daily, the bill effectively gives the government "full control of the media" and the Standard newspaper states that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "hit a hard blow" and criticize the bill as "still."
The approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures to strengthen national security immediately after the Islamic shooter's attack at the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The authorities' anger was approached by the Kenyan media when it broadcast a security camera footage of the soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by having two journalists and a head of a media officer be called in for questioning, but the summons were later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million by Kenyan shillings and individual journalists can be fined up to one million, along with the risk of "depending on the list" or be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The General Court also has the right to seize the assets of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "an even one fine is enough to dispose of most radio stations."
It is also reported that these measures may have a winding-up impact on what is called Kenya's "live blogosphere."
Politicians know that if they siln the media, they can do what they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen," wrote the journalist for the Nation Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of the system of mutual control and balancing in public life.
"If we leave it to the politicians, they bankrupt the country and cast us back for hunting and collecting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been criticized by the public in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts imposed by the National Wage Agency and to restore their heated salaries to resume their heated salaries of around 532 000 untaxed shillings a month, which thus ranks among the highest in the world.
As a result of the tax on owners of foreign real estate, the London bubble is bursting
The Ministry of Finance provisionally calculated the tax on the proceeds of the financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborne, who presented a fee of 7% in the 2012 budget for the transfer of properties for buildings worth over £2 million and the annual fees for buyers who own the properties within the company, not as individuals.
The yield on the transfer fee for the transfer of real estate in the housing stock in the districts of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached £708 million in tax year 2012/13, exceeds the total total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: ‘Given the increase in the transfer of real estate at high-value homes and the presentation of the related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are little taxed, regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system."
He added that "this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy properties in London, or that the existing owners are reluctant to sell."
Front properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in a rich strip ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, a record-breaking 11.8% increase in the past year.
Prices in the centre of London continue to show a steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but were overshadowed by the throatying market, on which, according to a survey by the real estate agency Savills, the North (7.4%) and the East (6.5%) were an increase.
Arctic Monkeys postponed Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys moved up the concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
The disease of lead singer Alexa Turner forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly coercted to postpone Thursday's appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys group says: "After deciding to postpone today's appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham, and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the appearance at the Hydro in Glasgow complex scheduled for Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with larynx inflammation and, unfortunately, he will not be able to get out."
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will thus take place on 20 November and a performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
