Economy and Center connect management.
For example, they offer joint advertising
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia has taken another step in transforming the Centrum holding into its media house.
Since Friday, the Economia and the Center have a common top management.
&quot;The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house,&quot; comments Kamil Čermák, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Economics and Acting CEO.
Čermák, who will head the unified management, will be joined by Andreas Demuth, Executive Director of Centrum Holdings.
Pavel Vopařil has been appointed the new joint director of the store, to which Zuzana Tylčerová, the advertising director of both companies, is also subordinate.
Štěpán Burda has become the new head of information technology.
The joint editorial director is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team also includes the director for transformation Jakub Unger.
Adéla Pittsová was appointed the newly established director of marketing.
An independent corporate communications department is now managed by Věra Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel Žalud, human resources management for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
&quot;Among other things, the new organizational structure will enable us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, better link the creation of the content of all published titles and, last but not least, further significantly streamline the company&#39;s business management,&quot; added Čermák.
Economia, owned by financier Zdeněk Bakala, entered into an agreement to acquire Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz servers, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz brands and the Najisto SMB agency, as well as a portfolio of almost two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, the IHNED.cz news server, the Respekt and Ekonom weekly magazines and a number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military planes allegedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakiyah on Thursday.
CNN reported it, citing an unnamed US government official.
The Israeli press reported widely on the explosion in the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
An Israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment on the raid when asked by CNN.
&quot;We do not comment on foreign media reports,&quot; she said.
According to a US government source, the target of the Israeli raid was rockets and related equipment that, in the opinion of the Israelis, could be transported to the militant Lebanese movement Hezbollah.
Referring to another US security official, the AP reported that Russian SA-125 missiles were the target of an Israeli raid on a target on Syrian territory.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
However, satellite images of the area of attack, according to the DPA agency, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they were said to see batteries of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar to track missiles and their targets.
According to a report by Israeli television, the recorded missiles have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed rocket shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and the AP said.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it would strike any supply of weapons destined for Hezbollah or other groups identified as terrorist.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that a return was unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since resigning in the leadership after ten years in June 2007, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussions on British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy to the Visa-Eastern Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his answer was quoted as follows by the London newspaper Evening Standard: &quot;Yes, of course, but it&#39;s probably hard to do that, so ...&quot;
Police evacuated part of the Los Angeles airport due to the shooting
There was a shooting in the morning at Los Angeles International Airport.
Due to this, the police evacuated part of the airport, allegedly terminal three.
Referring to the California media, Reuters claims that the men of the law shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times reported, citing police, that there was a shootout in which two to three members of the Traffic Safety Administration were injured.
How many people were injured in total and whether there are any victims, but it is still not clear.
Firefighters talk about the incident with more injured.
Berol and Štěpánek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
The non-playing captain of the Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil nominated Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek from the four-time captain of the Davis Cup against Serbia.
The Czech national team is defending the trophy, but they are going to play on the opponent&#39;s field in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the finals for the third time in the last five years.
&quot;We know we&#39;re going to hot soil, it&#39;s going to be wild and we have to focus on our performance as always.&quot;
&quot;We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best,&quot; said Stepanek, the architect of the winning point in last year&#39;s final with Spain.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors into space in a new digital studio
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can immerse themselves in new comfortable seats and a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz has been added above their heads.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
&quot;These are twenty-one computers that generate the image,&quot; said Jiří Dušek, director of the Brno Observatory.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
&quot;The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of classic personal computers,&quot; said Tomáš Hladík, a technician from the observatory.
The digitarium can enchant an extremely realistic and sculptural model of the night sky, the human body or the ocean floor.
Viewers will find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Another similar facility is the closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to screen the purchased programs and their own work in the hall.
There are two programs on Saturday since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it, people will learn about astronaut training, fly into space, spin in a centrifuge, and then see illustrative examples of the difficult conditions astronauts face in space.
The second show is for children and is called Magic Cliff - Kaluoka&#39;hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the moment when a nearby volcano erupted.
The whole digitarium cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
&quot;The rest was swallowed by audiovisual equipment and computers,&quot; Dušek explained.
The installation of the digital studio followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to director Dušek, 25 to 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.
The Supreme Court upheld Obama&#39;s health care law
The US Supreme Court has ruled that the health care law signed by Barack Obama is in line with the constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
With a 5: 4 vote, the court ruled that an individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - which ordered citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, otherwise threatened to pay a fine - did not contradict the constitution under government tax authority.
Court President John Roberts sided with four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also upheld the remainder of the 2,700-page law and ruled that a statutory health care requirement dictating states to expand sickness insurance, otherwise there is a risk of losing all federal sickness funding, is not coercive and unconstitutional.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have filed lawsuits to block the law.
During the 2012 primaries, the law vehemently rejected any of the major Republican candidates, including the presumed nominee, Mitt Romney.
Naďa Konvalinková in the role of a pub.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Naďa Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub and she did very well.
That the popular Czech actress would plan a change of profession and start a business in a pub?
Naďa Konvalinková appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and made beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I could do it right away.
My boss even offered to hire me so I could make a living drinking beer.
But I refused, I would rather stay with what I do to this day, with acting, &quot;said Konvalinková with a smile, who was a guest on the twentieth anniversary of the Irish pub.
&quot;I like Irish beer and I&#39;ll have Irish whiskey here and there,&quot; the actress revealed her tastes.
Nadi, a long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nový, also appeared at the event.
I&#39;m dead and I&#39;m not allowed to get drunk in today&#39;s new life.
I am allowed one beer or one shot a day, and I try to keep that, &quot;the actor added.
Egypt inaugurates the first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursi took the inaugural oath, but his triumphant day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; when he was inaugurated as the country&#39;s first freely elected president, after Husni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
When inaugurated before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges dressed in black robes in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
&quot;We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
&quot;The Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life today - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,&quot; said Mursi, a 60-year-old US-engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by governments.
When Mursi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time, hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential grandeur of Mubarak&#39;s term, traffic was stopped for a short time to allow the convoy to pass the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs in the south.
Mursi&#39;s personal prestige, derisively referred to as the Muslim Brotherhood&#39;s non-charismatic &quot;spare tire&quot;, has risen sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate of Islamists but also of all those who want to end the rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak. .
&quot;Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state today,&quot; Mursi, dressed in a blue formal suit with a red tie, told judges in a wood-paneled chamber where he had taken the oath.
Mursi later traveled to Cairo University to give an inaugural address.
While he was alert, he received an official welcome from a military band that played the national anthem.
Military Commander Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the chanting of &quot;the army and the people are one hand&quot; from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamic student movements.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak&#39;s authoritarian government last year, and solemnly promised to reclaim the presidential powers taken from his office by a military council that took them over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he has succumbed to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi&#39;s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
If you really want to get to know a city, you should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the centered center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than a bedekr would reveal.
Many people &quot;read from the graves&quot;.
Slowly, cemeteries roam and gain intimate insight into local reality.
They find out what people live here, what nationalities, what beliefs they belong to, how big and cohesive families they belong to, what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were for them.
How they express their social status, what taste they have.
And he will find out from the condition of the graves how the survivors take care of their dead.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay up long and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I&#39;ve become a hunchback.
No candy appeared in my apartment for two years, and this year it probably won&#39;t be any different.
However, statistics show that I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans will celebrate Halloween this year - in fact 158 million of them - and will spend a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations.
But what I always look forward to on Halloween are trends.
According to the NRF, 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent is expected to go to costumes.
This year is the latest fad of sexy inanimate objects.
It doesn&#39;t have to be just women anymore; Foods like pizza, hamburgers and carrots can also be sexy.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies from the parade of the dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there&#39;s nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $ 330 million this year on pet costumes.
So he will see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don&#39;t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion.
That&#39;s about 300 million pounds of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark sticks.
This is amazing news for the 41 million carolers who, according to the US Department of Commerce, are about to raid our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween we buy, and believe me don&#39;t believe and consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don&#39;t want is corn candies, and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, almost 16,000 tons will be sold around Halloween.
That&#39;s about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That&#39;s a secret I&#39;ve never unraveled.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, like &quot;Terror behind the walls,&quot; &quot;Howl-O-Scream,&quot; and &quot;The house of shock.&quot;
In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses in the United States, which, according to American Haunted House, have a profit of $ 500 million, including the amazing photos you&#39;re scared of fear and your friend puts on Facebook and you can&#39;t remove. the person you like will look at the photo and write a comment like &quot;you look nice&quot;.
And finally a little about pumpkins.
Even when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to a big pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - we&#39;ve been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the &quot;baby in a pumpkin&quot; trend didn&#39;t start with Pinterest until last year, so most of us grew up carving a gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you&#39;re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon of Napa, California, and try cutting their pumpkin, which weighs almost a ton.
How insects from Thailand raised sales in a Paris bar
Maybe you grin at the insect and you have no idea that you eat it about half a kilogram a year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you also have a unique experience.
Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of Le Festin Nu, was the first to list the insect menu in Paris to his company&#39;s menu in early October.
The bar, whose name was inspired by William Burroughs&#39; book Naked Lunch, can be found in the fashionable 18th arrondissement near Montmartre, frequented by tourists.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests can now experience not only various larvae, grasshoppers or water beetles, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (so that the insects do not damage their wings, bend their legs or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it is common elsewhere.
The owner of a Parisian bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons to consume insects.
The first is the ecological benefit, because the production of insects is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finances, space and water consumption) than with traditional meat.
&quot;In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids,&quot; Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, the feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
&quot;I&#39;m not saving the world, I&#39;m just conveying a new experience,&quot; he explained.
Not everyone would be thrilled by the idea of consuming a pesto decorated with pesto, but the reactions of Parisian bar customers to the insects served are very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics are said to eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest bites and only finally choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands will CHANGE YOUR MOOD.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two had the task of solving an unsolvable task.
Of course, both failed.
But the group, which washed its hands after the failure, looked much more optimistic than the one where its participants did not wash their hands.
The &quot;washed hands&quot; group also performed better than the other in the next test.
Nevertheless, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in further tests than those who did not.
The results of the &quot;washed&quot; were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not experience any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that body cleanliness removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, motivation is declining, and test subjects have to concentrate much more in further tests.
If we transferred the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but on the way by public transport it is already a fifth.
They usually also cling to hygiene after working in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
Petting a pet motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks about how much it is necessary to wash your hands after giving a hand to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
&quot;Although it would be appropriate, I&#39;m afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a little better,&quot; commented dermatologist Klaudie Komárková on the results of the survey.
A drug smuggling tunnel was found between the United States and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been discovered, complete with its own lighting, ventilation, and electric railroad.
U.S. authorities have described the tunnel, about one by one meter in size, as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds to the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the USA.
This area is full of vague warehouses, where trucks can be easily hidden before being loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unnoticed.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, the authorities also seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of conviction, they face imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers infiltrate vast drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a problem for drug cartels to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a 650-meter-long corridor equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing together businesses and defining what changes British entrepreneurs and job creation companies want to see in relation to the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked leading British entrepreneurs for their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing UK businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get bogged down in a long and arduous process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly regulation to product laws - most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competencies should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area - as many as 40 percent of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European companies, agreed.
Finally, our survey of business leaders has revealed the most telling knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to work for a change in the treaty and its relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings of companies of all sizes and major business groups show that the business sector is pushing for &quot;meaningful change&quot; that will transfer influence back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake - reaching a treaty change and a better agreement for Britain could mean up to 16% of the vote in a referendum to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British membership of the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better agreement for Britain is possible and, as the eurozone embarks on a path towards closer economic and fiscal union, it is increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority, and as the results of our survey show, for business, this means refocusing on trade and fundamentally changing Brussels&#39; regulatory approach.

The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2&#39;s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and the north of England will begin as soon as the first phase begins in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would &quot;bring Britain together&quot;.
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was &quot;enthusiastic&quot; about working with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase Two, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The UK government, which interviewed Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to identify additional rail capacity and opportunities to improve travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: &quot;Our goal for HS2 is truly a national network that better connects Britain and its cities.&quot;
We have given SH2 the green light, because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without this, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
But it&#39;s also about connectivity - HS2 will better connect 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: &quot;Today&#39;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot;
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to &quot;unequivocally&quot; support Scottish inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: &quot;The high-speed line has the potential to bring immeasurable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds to Scotland&#39;s economic weight in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain.&quot;
So we are excited to work with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to benefit everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh route, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study with British ministers over the next year and to jointly deciding on the next steps.
Frontier Airlines is going to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for carrying hand luggage on board on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $ 100 for hand luggage and $ 2 for coffee or soda, although they said in a statement on Wednesday that passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage fee applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free.
Frontier says it will charge $ 25 if paid in advance and $ 100 if passengers wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&#39;Malley said the 100-dollar fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
&quot;We wouldn&#39;t like to charge this fee,&quot; she said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and stuffed their hand luggage as hidden as possible in the storage area, so there was often no space in the area.
Charges are one way of teaching passengers to take fewer things on board.
O&#39;Malley said the new fee didn&#39;t really mean to make more money.
The point is that Frontier&#39;s most loyal customers have made it very clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper storage space.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company&#39;s website will not pay.
This means that one queued passenger at the Frontier gate can bring luggage for which he pays nothing, while the other queued passenger pays $ 100 for the same luggage.
O&#39;Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be adapted to ensure that passengers find out about the charge before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier&#39;s new hand luggage fee will not be in effect until the summer, but a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
He claims that handling luggage costs money and that passengers who require the service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the additional baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
But most did not touch on hand luggage fees.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, later followed suit.
The only company that also has such charges is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit&#39;s hand luggage fee would generate $ 50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit baggage fee.
&quot;Getting on the plane was the smoothest I&#39;ve ever seen in my aviation career,&quot; he said.
I expected to see a gnashing of teeth and an argument at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, &quot;and the boarding took place in an instant.&quot;
Following the example of Spirit, Frontier will also charge for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be refilled for free.
Water will continue to be provided free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to impose beverage charges in 2008, but withdrew seven months later after passenger complaints, and no other major airline imitated it.
Frontier&#39;s latest move to charge for hand luggage, unless passengers purchase a flight directly from that airline, is its last effort to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel retailers such as Orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold.
This encouraged all airlines to buy passengers directly from them, instead of through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier went the furthest in this area.
In September, she began giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half a mile as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut her reward for miles to 25 percent of the way.
So a 1000-mile trip with Frontier purchased through an online travel agency means a reward of 250 miles.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is starting to shrink and lose money.
According to financial results reported on Wednesday by corporate partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
Republic is also trying to solve Frontier&#39;s financial problems by selling this airline.
We studied 11 THOUSAND ADVERTISEMENTS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 job advertisements, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 advertisements (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is thus becoming the most important medium for publishing job offers.
Back in 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), it has stabilized at around 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertisement of job opportunities in itself largely reflects the current situation on the labor market.
An example is a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in times of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same period under review, in 2012 it was less than half.
The offer of job positions on the Internet is focused on a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including manual ones, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
Advertisements looking for managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts took the top positions on the Internet.
The position of programmers or small business leaders figured only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, a large representation belongs mainly to service and labor professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through advertising.
Other areas monitored included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of advertisements did employers require an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Demands for &#39;computer literacy&#39; appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (11 percent in the daily press, 57 percent on the Internet).
Experience in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Requirements for practice are generally associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
The manual professions are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, added the author of the study Jiří Tillner.
Employers also state requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates in the middle of their advertisements.
Communication skills have long appeared in the first place as the most frequently required skills in advertising.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
One-fifth of shopping centers are facing low attendance
This is according to data from real estate consulting companies Cushman &amp; Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Center is opening to the public in Bohnice, Prague, and will be the 19th Prague shopping center.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are an inadequately large center relative to the site and poor layouts, ie too many floors or a complicated and confusing arrangement of passages, or dead centers, &quot;said Michal Soták from Cushman &amp; Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle head of retail real estate Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of shopping centers are experiencing low attendance.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or oversaturation of the market in the place.
Some projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, customers are a bit conservative and don&#39;t like to change their shopping habits.
New shopping centers need to do more to &#39;attract&#39; their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events, &quot;added Samadi.
According to Soták, the occupancy of shopping centers is generally stable, even rising for some centers, because landlords were willing to reduce rents and rent some units in the crisis.
&quot;However, it is true that recently some projects have been opened that are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda &amp; Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc),&quot; added Soták.
According to Sylvia Samadi, shopping centers opened in the last two years are gaining ground in the market very slowly.
But there is a place in the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called &#39;convinience centers&#39;, aimed at shopping and daily necessities for the population living in the immediate vicinity, &quot;said Samadi.
According to Soták, there is also room for other shopping centers on the domestic market.
Both for small &#39;service&#39; centers and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
&quot;Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth,&quot; added Soták.
In Prague, they see space for the upcoming shopping center on Vítězné náměstí, and according to him, Na Příkopě and Václavské náměstí streets have a clear potential.
&quot;The expansion of retail parks is developing intensively, enabling retailers to cover and expand to smaller and smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs. There is also space in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores. , which benefits from a good location, &quot;added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centers in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leasable area.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average; in comparison with the values from Britain and France, the Czechia lags behind by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia, who died in a strange accident, believe that he was murdered
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a crumpled wrestling spirit in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
On January 11, Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found trapped spiritually in the stands at the high school gym he went to.
Sheriff&#39;s investigators from Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of the 17-year-old refuses.
&quot;They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,&quot; lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he had died as the sheriff had said.
&quot;They believe it goes against logic, the laws of physics, and common sense,&quot; Crump said.
They believe that this should cover up what really happened in order to protect the person responsible for their son&#39;s death.
&quot;As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned to them in a body bag,&quot; he said.
Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson&#39;s death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a news conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
&quot;I believe there is a sufficient basis for a routine investigation,&quot; he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of &quot;positional suffocation.&quot;
However, according to Moore, the second autopsy stated another cause of death.
&quot;There are several questions that need to be answered or confirmed,&quot; he said.
Moore added that if, in the event of Johnson&#39;s death, he finds enough evidence to order an investigation into a crime or civil rights violation, he will ask the FBI and execute it.
The Lowndes County Sheriff&#39;s Office was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A judge from South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all videos from surveillance cameras that the investigators watched.
The adolescent&#39;s parents hope that the videos will contain a clue that reveals how their son died.
Report: Obama&#39;s campaign considered exchanging Biden for Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama&#39;s closest adviser was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton on the 2012 candidate.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, &quot;Double down: Game Change 2012.&quot;
The Times obtained a copy of the incoming book and announced Thursday night that the president&#39;s top associates were holding intensive group meetings and polls in late 2011 to see if getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama&#39;s fading hopes of re-election.
According to the national policy correspondent for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House chief Bill Daley, to measure the effect of moving former Secretary of State Clinton to vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president&#39;s closest advisers - including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that change was being considered.
The book &quot;Double Down&quot; claims that Daley was a representative of the efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the candidate would not significantly increase Obama&#39;s chances. &quot;.
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
&quot;I&#39;ve been researching a lot of things, and this was one of them,&quot; Daley told the newspaper.
You must not forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we thought, &quot;Kristepan, what are we supposed to do?&quot;
While Daley described the research as &quot;due diligence,&quot; Martin told CNN&#39;s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to see if the election move would pay off.
&quot;Campaigns don&#39;t spend that much money on elections and qualitative research unless something is really seriously considered,&quot; Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about this potential shuffling of cards.
While Daley said he did not think the president was &quot;aware&quot; of the potential change, the former head of the office admitted that it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book &quot;Double down&quot; definitely does not answer the question of whether the political probe got to the table of Obama.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn&#39;t know about the research on removing Biden from the candidate list.
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Martin replied.
That&#39;s not it, Mr. Hasek.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that they are not.
It is necessary to exert such pressure that Martin Hašek is deprived of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so slim.
Martin Hašek is shielding himself from the promise he has made, but everyone and the politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr. Babiš also has the material one, but it is a question of whether he is a politician).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He does not apologize in politics, he resigns in politics.
Mr Hašek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me, if you have not just lied - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made the mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakness whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be a proud, even a flawed person or a lifelong skeleton.
It may seem unfair to me to address only you, but you are the leader and they are the wrong sheep.
And you are a leader and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to lower your ears for a while, regroup your forces, dismantle the disgrace, and then attack again, but that is how guerrillas or stunts behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes a leader, an alpha male, so act like that.
Take responsibility and leave politics.
A black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits in your car&#39;s dashboard.
Devices that track every mile a motorist travels and transmit this information to authorities are at the heart of Washington and state planning authorities&#39; controversial efforts to renovate America&#39;s outdated highway funding system.
The usually dull design of motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists to lobby for the government to use these small lockers to record mileage and possibly where you are going - and then use that information to compile a tax assessment.
The tea party is horrified.
The US Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for a kilometer of road he travels.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
&quot;It&#39;s not a matter of much choice,&quot; said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Public Administration Association, which plans to begin mileage tracking for the state at every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The impetus is the fact that the Road Trust Fund, funded by the taxes that Americans pay at gas stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don&#39;t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars will travel many more kilometers per gallon.
The federal tax alone, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by just one cent.
&quot;The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this mileage system.
&quot;In the long run, this seems like the most logical alternative,&quot; he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometers traveled.
It is no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, as taxes can be used to change drivers&#39; behavior patterns, which can help reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California designers are looking to this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (Pennsylvania&#39;s chairman), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also saw it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Representatives of the free market from the Reason Foundation are also in favor of the idea that drivers will pay for mileage.
&quot;It&#39;s not a tax that disappears into a black hole,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they receive.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transportation ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards paying per kilometer.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal, and did so due to concerns from rural lawmakers representing members of the population, whose daily lives often mean driving many kilometers to work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The most ardent is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the mileage tax instead of the petrol tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is currently researching the project.
Illinois makes limited efforts on trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state departments of transportation, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement the change.
However, this concept has more than just supporters.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
&quot;Big Brother surveillance concerns and similar issues have been a major issue,&quot; said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn&#39;t something people wanted.
As the pilot project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website, &quot;It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.&quot;
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably expand to record the daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states that is trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometers the car will travel, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology has led some government agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was not originally involved in the action to help the government tax the drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging liability insurance market, where drivers would pay based on how much they traveled.
But this device, which it tests, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and supplies only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
&quot;People will be more willing to go if you don&#39;t track their speed and location,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have occurred in some of these pilot schemes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with or without GPS.
Or they don&#39;t have to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the state&#39;s population.
Elsewhere, they hope that a prudent public will embrace the concept if the facility can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are working to develop a tax facility that is equipped to pay extra parking hours, provide mileage insurance, and collect other drivers&#39; speed data so motorists can avoid traffic jams. .
&quot;Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them,&quot; says the city&#39;s project paper.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all discussions about paying per kilometer are not just a huge substitute.
Officials at the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could very easily solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other cars that do not use a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
&quot;No radical surgery is needed when you are rich in aspirin,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislation and Public Affairs Committee.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Which billionaire will you call next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations and, according to various sources from agencies and behind the scenes, they are said to be hand in hand.
The announcement of the transaction should arrive in November, probably before the start of the auction of frequencies for LTE networks, ie before 11 November.
Kellner&#39;s competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, it has started an auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to the general surprise, until then, there was no talk of the company&#39;s desire to penetrate telecommunications.
But Sazka is now run by a very experienced telecommunication eraser Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing head of Radiomobil (today T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and most recently headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and has now admitted that she wants to launch a virtual one at Vodafone.
And it gives logic.
If he succeeds in the auction, he will be able to move existing customers from his own virtual operator to his network.
Under normal circumstances, Vodafone would probably not like that, but according to information from Hospodářské noviny, it may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from an agreement between competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, which will completely share their networks.
Vodafone thus needs a partner.
And that can be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender for LTE networks (as a newcomer it can auction a specially designed spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to enter the auction at all, or it will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share networks with Sazka.
Vodafone will launch Sazka into its 2G / 3G network (or the newly built LTE network on the 900 MHz frequency), which will enable the company to start the network quickly.
Sazka, meanwhile, will start building an expensive LTE network that Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the money saved on a fixed internet or cable TV provider.
And Kellner?
By purchasing the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of the Czech Republic), it would immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a big mole that will await restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would win the LTE network for O2 and most likely in cooperation with T-Mobil.
Both companies have already declared that they will share networks.
The auction could finally end in success, but quite probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobil, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September in protest of planned oil production in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
The AFP agency informed about it today with reference to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
She also claims that the original allegations of piracy by her activists have not yet been dropped.
&quot;Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against an oil rig in the Arctic have been transported from a Murmansk correctional facility to a St. Petersburg prison,&quot; the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA, it was a planned move.
Authorities first accused ecologists of piracy, for which they could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace the accusation with a more lenient rioting, for which they face a lower sentence with an upper limit of seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace said in a statement today that allegations of piracy had not yet been dropped by the authorities, as promised.
This means that the detainees are now charged with two crimes.
The powerful Committee of Inquiry announced last week that it would replace the allegations of piracy with allegations of rioting.
But when thirty prisoners stood before the committee this week, the allegations of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, a new charge was filed against everyone, &quot;AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
The Russians detained 30 Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom&#39;s oil rig in mid-September.
Environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against whom they have lodged an appeal, but the court has rejected them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of imprisonment.
According to AFP, Greenpeace executive director Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St. Petersburg will make it easier for detainees to meet their families and consular staff.
However, there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
&quot;In fact, they may be worse,&quot; he warned.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, she called on the monarch to discuss their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A cocaine lawyer who warned the mobster about a police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass information to the underworld king Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer who informed the drug mafia about a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light was sentenced to three years in prison.
After becoming a suspect in cocaine use, Basharat Ditta, 42, was to provide underworld chief Neil Scarbrough with sensitive information about the investigation into his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; (party) and who was celebrated by criminals as the best lawyer, was arrested at home in 2011 after police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he represented in previous drug proceedings.
Police saw Sarborough (32) leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer&#39;s house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was having dinner with his Law Society colleagues.
Tests showing that traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards showed that Ditta was a regular user of class A drugs.
Over a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried insidiously to obtain information about the arrests of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were being tracked at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police seized about £ 1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine along with £ 200,000 in cash during a series of raids, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) passed the information on to criminals for fear of finding out about his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors, based in Blackburn, experienced a disgraceful moment before a Liverpool Crown court when, after three weeks in court, he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases.
During an earlier hearing, he confessed to possessing cocaine.
The lawyer&#39;s downfall came after a Scarborough police investigation revealed that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives watched the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt&#39;s house and saw him place 60 percent pure drugs under a lawyer&#39;s basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough was in a regular telephone conversation with Ditta, who was having dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, where he found the drugs, and there were nine conversations between the two people.
The court said traces of a class A drug were found in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, and that Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, saying he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation was &quot;confidential.&quot;
During his arrest, Ditt took his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but all were detained and his hair samples were taken.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated the office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that his clients also visited him at home due to work matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he had contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: &quot;Who else is more aware that they must not violate the law than a criminal lawyer.&quot;
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer and of coming into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we are talking about here is not just about a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were no doubt legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
He thwarted the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their crime.
Mr Ditta did not reputation his profession, but instead dishonored it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed the offense and said, &quot;If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not and I wanted to pass on information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do so immediately.&quot;
However, after the hearing, Police Inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: &quot;Mr Ditta himself became a criminal from a criminal lawyer when he started obtaining drugs from organized criminals.&quot;
His addiction to cocaine has made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading organized crime groups to gather valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and inspire public confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit has been investigating Mr Ditt, which has also convicted him of three cases of cocaine possession and now of obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta conducted an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death cell bloc in America, to wish Mohammed Ali as a dinner guest, and to mention inequality as a motivation for his work.
Obama is withdrawing from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama backed down from his oft-repeated and ambitious promise yesterday that &quot;if you like your health program, you can keep it.&quot;
Citing hundreds of thousands of notices of denunciation from providers, Republicans in recent days have accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama withdrew from his original promise.
&quot;The vast majority of people with well-functioning health insurance can keep them,&quot; he said in a speech in Boston.
Given what he called the &quot;media uproar&quot; about the dismissals, Obama called on Americans who received the announcements to look for new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same cost or even cheaper than expected.
&quot;You&#39;ll get a better offer,&quot; he said.
His administration argues that it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance on their own may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
&quot;I&#39;m telling these Americans, you deserve better,&quot; Sebelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet market had been &quot;miserable&quot; since October.
&quot;I&#39;m disappointed and upset like everyone else,&quot; she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
Irritated, Sebelius uttered the sentence, which was picked up by a switched-on microphone, at the counselor sitting behind her at yesterday&#39;s Committee meeting after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a Missouri representative, on whether she herself had to to participate in Obama&#39;s care program.
For more than three hours during the hearing, he repeatedly questioned Sebelius why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance and bought the program through HealthCare.gov, which he now imposes on millions of Americans.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in West African countries; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year Award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year competition, you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father faint again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon, Yaounde.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, creating a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
&quot;There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,&quot; says Georges Bwelle.
We would have to take him outside Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
&quot;It&#39;s not easy,&quot; says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you are not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle&#39;s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one physician per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could visit a Cameroonian doctor, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country&#39;s health care spending is private.
&quot;The only problem they have is poverty,&quot; says Bwelle.
S cannot enjoy life because of poverty.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas over the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped almost 32,000 people with his group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people cram into supplies, attach medical supplies to rooftops, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
Happiness does not always accompany them.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they receive a welcome like real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle - with her wide smile and unbridled energy - is very willing to get involved in the local festivities.
The next day, the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
&quot;We have 500 patients on each expedition,&quot; says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical aids.
Many are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches or donated glasses or a birth certificate for free - a document that the school demands, but which many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually done in a school building, town hall, or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make room for another patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It&#39;s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not lose motivation.
&quot;To stay awake and keep working, they play drums all night,&quot; says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group - consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - performed 700 free operations last year and recognizes that their help can mean a lot to the locals.
One man said he would be able to work again after hernia surgery.
&quot;It will change the future for our family,&quot; the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around Yaounde.
He says that this second work finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
&quot;I&#39;m not sure when he&#39;s asleep,&quot; says Katie O&#39;Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for the second year and working as a volunteer for Bwell&#39;s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O&#39;Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it&#39;s a great practice they wouldn&#39;t get at home.
&quot;We washed Dr. Bwell&#39;s hands thoroughly and removed blood stains or held tools,&quot; says O&#39;Malley.
As a second-year medical student in America, you&#39;ll never experience it.
Student volunteers usually pay for the trip to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, Bwell provides food, transportation and study.
&quot;He&#39;s definitely a hero,&quot; says O&#39;Malley.
He is giving his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, the constant sled is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier, to fulfill the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
&quot;I&#39;m so happy to do this job,&quot; Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I&#39;m doing.
Laughing people, relieving their pain - that&#39;s why I do it.

Central banks will maintain swap lines permanently
Interim and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to give banks access to global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
&quot;It&#39;s a very sensible move,&quot; commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at London&#39;s Barclays Bank.
&quot;So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is no surprise in my opinion,&quot; adds Vojtěch Benda, Chief Economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are reinforcing the shackles that began in 2007, when the international credit market first stalled.
Central bank agreements gave access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The decision of the central bankers comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its program to support the US economy, which could drive the price of money in the global market even higher.
By default, a swap contract is used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while exceeding the liquidity of the other currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB launches a third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
The number of people infected with HIV exceeded one thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of people infected is growing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121, and in 2010 there were 180.
212 were infected last year and it was a record number.
&quot;I think there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year,&quot; said Miroslav Hlavatý, an expert on AIDS, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, 165 HIV patients were added to the country last January, and this year there were 176 over the same period.
From the beginning of the monitoring until the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
206 infected people lived in the Central Bohemian Region.
156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian Region and 116 from the Ústí nad Labem Region also heard the diagnosis.
The least infected come from the Vysočina region, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients became infected during sex.
Fourteen people have contracted blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, ie for more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with the HIV virus and passed on from their mother to them.
Children should learn myths and legends as &quot;models of the way of life,&quot; says the author.
Stories of Thor may show that &quot;brute force cannot match cunning cunning,&quot; while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths would be &quot;too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene, for school instruction,&quot; said Crossley-Holland, who advocates careful selection of age-appropriate works.
&quot;I think it&#39;s great that myths and folk art are already part of education,&quot; he said.
I defended this plan for twenty years.
He added that &quot;openly instructive&quot; authors and teachers are a &quot;switch&quot; for engaging stories with a &quot;subliminal&quot; message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Tales, says: &quot;You may have good intentions, but you will do better to keep them to yourself.&quot;
Probably the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end in a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And he must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly set.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
Miloslava Cejpková: The November Smile
It came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not used to yet.
At first she put off her smile, the one she still showed off as a defense against the would-be friendly environment.
This relieved her a lot, because it was a mask she decided not to put off in public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she grandmothered and had her grandchildren Elinka or Adík around her.
And, of course, when her sons called her.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless business skills courses.
Now they really fit now.
So as not to grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into a corner.
Like a masquerade disguise.
November, or another month, can&#39;t do the miracle to make her smile, like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn&#39;t been here for almost three years.
Pierre Rainero: I try to develop Cartier&#39;s style as a living language
My task is to preserve tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains Pierre Rainero, Cartier&#39;s director of style, in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
GM is recalling some new light trucks in the United States to repair seat backs
According to Friday&#39;s announcement from the US automotive safety authority, General Motors is withdrawing nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to repair the manual backrest tilt.
On some of these vehicles, the front seat tilt mechanism may be defective.
As a result, seat backs do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
An announcement on the NHTSA website states that &quot;if the car is struck from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the occupants, which increases the risk of an accident.&quot;
The downloaded models were made between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the delivery in June, and this is the most important launch of the vehicle for this leading American carmaker, from restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery owner of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the notice to owners due to a 16-day government malfunction that weakened car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra supplies, which were reworked for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado models and 16,503 Sierra models out of its deliveries.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $ 37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Too inquisitive newspapers are to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the administrator told the press.
Guangzhou-based New Express has made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a partly state-owned company.
The warden said the New Express newspaper would now make a &quot;full remedy&quot;.
The order to &quot;correct&quot; came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
A preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper in the Evening News group in Yangcheng published several false reports about Zoomlion.
&quot;The editorial staff of the New Express newspaper was disorganized,&quot; the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide to &quot;impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revoking the press license.&quot;
He also &quot;ordered the Yangcheng group Evening News to carry out a complete overhaul of the New Express and recommended that the relevant New Express officials be investigated and immediately change the management of the New Express.&quot;
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express about financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, his newspaper published two front-page applications for his release, claiming that he was behind his journalistic work.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and confessed to publishing false stories for a fee.
&quot;In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion as well as to the entire media industry and its ability to gain the public&#39;s trust,&quot; he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I longed for money and fame.
I realize I did wrong.
Following Mr Chen&#39;s apology, the front-page New Express issued an apology stating that he had failed to do not adequately review his reports.
Recently, several closely watched suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the confessions are still regularly enforced, despite a change in the law this year, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
With the growing misery of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are booming
At a pawn shop in Bendemeer Shopping Mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter&#39;s tuition.
&quot;My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it,&quot; says Mrs Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $ 2,400 (SGD 3,000) as an administrator each month and her husband also works, the family&#39;s monthly income is insufficient, he says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia - where household debt is rising - is such that ValueMax, where the woman conducts her transaction, became the third pawnshop on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to borrow cash - SGD 1,300 in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga - but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore normally apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require verification of the person (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
Therefore, as families feel pressure due to rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawn shops.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit supported by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawn shops to cope with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s cited the increasing use of credit in households, mainly due to rising rents, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists also feared high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which had just emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
&quot;Significantly, with rising costs, people from the middle to the low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can,&quot; said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia&#39;s CIMB.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have helped people hastily pledge their personal belongings and take the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items pledged in 200 city pawnshops are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma&#39;s gold necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand&#39;s largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen an increase of up to 20 percent in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
Growth in the pawnshop industry is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemeer Center and 15 similar ones in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia - where it has four branches - but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund it using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it raised on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn&#39;t directly increase debt.
&quot;Customers pledge items they already own, and monetizing personal property doesn&#39;t increase household debt,&quot; he says.
In the company, the pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, not only people in financial distress are among those who use pawn shops.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches to stop gold bars or Rolex watches, and can get up to 60 percent of the cash purchase price.
Our customers are of all possible circumstances.
&quot;These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow on a short-term basis for their bold business or investment, or small businesses that need help solving their cash flow problems,&quot; says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money as quickly as possible.
The NSA does not blame hackers for the crash of the website, but an &quot;internal mistake&quot;
The mysterious National Security Agency said last Friday that its website had been down for several hours last week due to an internal error, not a hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
&quot;The NSA.gov website was not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update,&quot; the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be fixed later tonight.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server scanners noted that the NSA&#39;s website had been down for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
An NSA spokesman previously told ABC News that the agency&#39;s internal sensitive networks were &quot;not at all&quot; compromised.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacking activists on the Internet has claimed to be responsible for shutting down NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood information target sites until the servers are overloaded and the page crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA top-secret agency, once nicknamed No Such Agency, has been the focus of public alienation in recent months after a string of foreign and domestic surveillance programs and the harsh criticism of the NSA&#39;s secret files and the disclosure of disillusioned former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today&#39;s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of HIV infections in Prague exceeded one thousand
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with the HIV virus.
From the beginning of the monitoring in 1986 until the end of this year&#39;s third quarter, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This follows from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Institute of Health.
According to her, 2,063 people have been infected so far in the whole Czech Republic.
In 396, the disease of immune failure had already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infected people in the Czech Republic has been growing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new diseases and in 2010 180.
The year before, the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the laboratory, there were 212 of them.
&quot;In my opinion, the fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 is no longer a doubt,&quot; said Miroslav Hlavatý, an expert on AIDS, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, said Hlavatý.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the start of follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS broke out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the brink of strength
It is almost a rule that, at key moments in the country, the head of state was not in a position to fulfill his state duties.
If T. Masaryk had been five years younger physically and mentally younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidency and the events around Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We probably wouldn&#39;t have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly abroad, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not fight hard for its legitimacy.
And most importantly, the nation would not have a hangover from that surrender to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and was still in shape during Munich, but during the war it started to go downhill with him and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
Being a little better about it, he could go into exile for the third time and undermine the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It&#39;s a shame to talk about Hách.
He was elected, saying &quot;the president will not be in a position to make a decision.&quot;
But he had to, although he didn&#39;t make much of a decision with Hitler&#39;s neck in the Chancellery.
Until the last days in March 1939, the head of intelligence, František Moravec, said what everything should be done so that the occupation, which he knew exactly for the day, did not go so smoothly and with such a profit to the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, they didn&#39;t trust him, they were afraid.
Human wreck Gottwald had his age-old fellows executed, as Moscow had instructed.
Ludvík Svoboda definitely became impossible to participate in the normalization and they had to overthrow him, already completely senile.
That Husák was helpless and a sick depressed old man made things easier in November 89, but that&#39;s the only plus.
Havel was lucky not to be met in office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, many of his deeds suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, now we have this.
The head of state and the commander in chief of the armed forces looks what he looks like, and we don&#39;t know all that yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the republic now.
Or maybe it&#39;s threatening, it&#39;s just not so visible.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is not (historically) good that the president is not completely in power.
But it is not a normal state.
Couldn&#39;t we elect someone acceptably thinking and acceptably healthy as president in this country once again?

Schwarzenberg: We have early elections here in two years
TOP 09 chairman Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early elections soon.
One week after the last ones, he said in an interview for Aktuálně.cz that there is no other way out and that every government that emerged from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible conglomerate.
&quot;It can&#39;t last long,&quot; said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he estimates the life of the beginning of the election period at two years.
He disagrees with the objection that voters will hardly choose completely differently next time: &quot;I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making.&quot;
At the same time, the chairman of TOP 09 does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next elections as this year (compared to 2010, it lost about 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that there would be early elections, it would strengthen Andrej Babiš&#39;s YES 2011 movement.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will lose.
Schwarzenberg comments on the turbulent situation in the CSSD, where chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting in part of the party leadership, was secret, that he or Michal Hašek will remain in the leadership of the Social Democracy.
&quot;Democratic party leaders as little boys go after the head of state to allow them to revolutionize the party.&quot;
&quot;I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and smarter.&quot;
&quot;Because I have never seen anything so eagerly done in my life,&quot; added the chairman of TOP 09.
And to President Zeman (whom he clashed in the presidential race), he said: &quot;The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to seize the party.&quot;
The first laws have already been submitted by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws in the Chamber of Deputies, including Farský&#39;s register of treaties, which was discussed by parliamentary committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the chairman of TOP 09 claims that such speed is due to the fact that &quot;these laws are needed&quot;.
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other sides.
For example, the election leader of the YES movement, Martin Komárek, accused TOP 09 in the pre-election campaign of &quot;stealing&quot; the YES movement&#39;s program with the idea of introducing a treaty register.
TOP 09 now took advantage of the lead - it simply dusted off the proposal, which had already entered the second parliamentary reading.
Coulson hacked into the phone to verify the tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson reportedly used &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation&quot; methods to confirm a fraudulent love affair tip involving then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis told Old Bailey Court that the News of the World caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his &quot;attractive special adviser,&quot; Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to break into Pawlby&#39;s voicemail and intrude on her privacy, but it was reported in court that Coulson had called her and left her voicemails.
&quot;The prosecutor suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man standing in front of the house hoping to catch people outside, but a man who likes to tell people stories to see what they have to say,&quot; he said. Edis.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the other one, watching, he has to know about her.
And what about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say, &quot;But sure he knows.&quot;
Rumor of Clarke&#39;s love affair was first intercepted by NotW&#39;s news department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, &quot;You&#39;re just wasting your time with Charles.&quot;
A recording with voice messages taken from her telephone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair&#39;s house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator&#39;s computer, where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as &quot;Projects.&quot;
During Ms. Pawlby&#39;s investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former Chief Rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former Rapporteur James Weatherup oversaw Mrs Pawlby&#39;s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice message telling her, &quot;I&#39;ve got a story we&#39;re going to tell tomorrow about which I&#39;d love to talk to Charles about.&quot;
Mr Edis says Couson&#39;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as other dignitaries, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
It was reported in court on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman, while he was seeing co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied associating with others for the purpose of hacking into telephones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the place where solo comic performances were born in America: almost a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fray, who served as chairman of ceremonies at the Palace Theater on Broadway, began telling jokes to people.
Fay&#39;s innovation has spread over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
&quot;Most of these titles have appeared in the Carolines and have become so successful that they are too big to be played in a club,&quot; Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year&#39;s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as &quot;Stand Up for Heroes&quot;, an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger, among others. Waters and Bill Cosby.
As this festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year&#39;s festival came from non-traditional channels, such as shows on smaller radio and television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll got up with his sitcom (a cheerfully spicy &quot;League&quot; on a fantastic-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both Saturday night live and Parks and recreation, but became best known for her rapidly expanding series of &quot;Marcel the shell with shoes on&quot; videos.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the scathing, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest highlights of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV show on TV Land called &quot;Sit down comedy with David Steinberg&quot;.
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
&quot;This city is definitely in the comedic DNA of all of Larry&#39;s work,&quot; Steinberg said.
He told me that when he&#39;s here, he walks the aisle between two buildings from time to time and says to himself: man, if I lose all my money, maybe I&#39;ll live here.
Many things have moved, and they are different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while the chairman Štěch fanned the quarrel.
Hetman Chovanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
Chairman Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of the CSSD&#39;s misery.
The other gentlemen showed mainly their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and legible and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek was most prevented by an interview on television.
Based on this, I do not see a better option than for the CSSD to nominate Gajdůšková, Vice-President of the Senate, as Prime Minister, the only one would not have an initial handicap, and I think it would perform a standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone from the management will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and continue without tearing up the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could form a minority government without fear with a mere blessing from President Babiš and without the People&#39;s Party, but with the People&#39;s Minister of Health Hovorka, who is actually a believing Social Democrat.
This mini-minority government would have great stability, as it would enforce a proper referendum law, and the chairman of Dawn Okamura also undertook to support such a one.
President Babiš would eventually come to terms with the progress of the taxes, as he is smart and will see that it is not possible without her.
The People&#39;s Party would not bring problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not be in government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, a valuable minister would be found here as well, but if they do not reasonably want to enter into risky government participation, but will provide support, they will also do well.
Let&#39;s give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
Bárta&#39;s detention is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is it behind the escape of wiretaps?
The chairman of Public Affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Jan Petržílek, head of the analytics and informatics department of the anti-corruption police, was detained along with him.
The arrests are related to the wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about wiretaps, which the Novinky.cz server came up with, was confirmed to the Czech Press Office by a trusted source.
The intercepted telephone conversations between Janoušek and Bém, published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which both men address &quot;Mazánka&quot; and &quot;Kolibřík&quot;, show Janoušek&#39;s influence on the city&#39;s actions under Bém&#39;s leadership.
The daily said at the time that they were acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which they escaped to the ABL security agency two years later.
It was then owned by Bárta.
The Novinky.cz server pointed out that the detained criminal investigator Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretaps, at the same time as they were published.
&quot;With regard to the Act on the Protection of Classified Information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all,&quot; said the plaintiff Michal Muravský from the Municipal Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was supervising the case.
The inspectorate does not want to comment on the case for the same reason.
He and Vít Bárta also detained an anti-corruption police officer
Bárta&#39;s lawyer Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV deputies, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: &quot;Yes, I also represent the client in this matter, but due to the protection of classified information I can not comment further.&quot;
According to the Law, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS).
The tn.cz server stated that Bárta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the position of Bárta he allegedly sought.
Recent information, however, shows that the arrest of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
Eva Kropáčová, a spokeswoman for the police presidium, declined to comment, saying that the case was being handled by the Prague City Council.
&quot;With regard to the protection of classified information, we will not comment on this question in any way,&quot; Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the Municipal Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office in Prague, told Práva on Friday.
It is the plaintiff there who supervises Bárt&#39;s case, and it is indirectly apparent from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted in secret.
Reporter Novinky managed to find Vít Bárta&#39;s wife Kateřina Klasnová in the morning before their residence in Klárov, Prague.
She was loading her suitcases into the car and leaving.
She declined to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement, Tomio Okamura, spoke about Bart&#39;s arrest.
According to him, he has no idea what the case is about.
&quot;Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate list, and as I repeatedly said before the election, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tomia Okamura,&quot; he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement in the last early elections to the Chamber of Deputies in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case in bribing MPs in Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Subsequently, the verdict was changed and Bárta was acquitted.
Concerns about Mozambique&#39;s security are escalating due to a conflict between strong personalities
Under a statue of Samora Machela, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to shout peace slogans at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability, &quot;said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for her country&#39;s future, she changed her business attire to a T-shirt adorned with &quot;we demand safety&quot; in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were reports almost daily of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst skirmishes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, originally supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country&#39;s independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that an open conflict will break out in the country again, but recent events have frightened foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of large offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in investments worth more than $ 50 billion from companies such as Brazil&#39;s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy&#39;s Eni and US&#39;s Anadarko over the next few years. .
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tension.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members on September 17 in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of the Renamo Party.
The violent attack on former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked a Renamo base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the group&#39;s leader, Renamo party spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for launching the conflicts because it allegedly attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to allay fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told the French AFP news agency on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a &quot;loser&quot; who wanted to use &quot;whatever he could to try to prove that he could order his own decisions to the government.&quot;
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew when Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told France Télécom that he meant that Frelimo was no longer respecting the agreement.
&quot;Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but seriously,&quot; Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions between the parties, fueled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It is a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which was pushing for electoral change, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by the moribund movement to gain benefits and financial gain from the government.
Renamo&#39;s turnout has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), founded by a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its electoral position.
Mr Mazanga says Mr Guebuza - whose second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country&#39;s democracy.
&quot;He does not want a multi-party democratic system, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to release the presidency,&quot; Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but it has carried out subversive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key north-south road.
Most of the skirmishes have taken place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira is a port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely for their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended rail use for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to &quot;warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,&quot; Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
&quot;People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president, and that he should be the one to find a solution to the problems,&quot; he says.
Protester Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
&quot;Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace, they want free access to the roads,&quot; he says.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labor Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Corruption Oversight Committee.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing its coastal leasing policy at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obeid, who has hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday extended its investigation into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to renew his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a coffee shop, without having to expiry in August 2005 to take part in the competition.
The committee is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid&#39;s secret interests in the property, based on evidence presented Thursday by Mr Tripodi&#39;s former deputy head of office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks that began in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go public tenders.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term terms.
In 2009, leases to Circular Quay businesses, which brought the Obeids $ 2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in the tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
However, he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi had admitted, urged a shift in the government&#39;s rental policy.
The transcript of calls submitted to ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr Tripod and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ports Department after working under Mr Obeid in the fisheries department.
&quot;Was the development of commercial leasing policy the subject of conversations during these telephone calls?&quot; Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi.
&quot;No,&quot; Mr. Tripodi replied.
I can&#39;t remember what we were talking about, but definitely not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.

The dog rolled up the carpet, the president tripped, and ended up on crutches
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the chateau in Lány.
What is his medical condition?
Cabbage is bubbling in Kunovice, they are not adding chemistry to it
In the coming months, they want to produce more than a thousand tons of sauerkraut in Slovácká Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group.
The season here began in October and will last about half a year.
He has been making a healthy delicacy here since 1925, still in the traditional way, ie by pedaling directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, this is a rarity.
Our workers will follow a route of almost ten kilometers per shift.
Each of the ten tanks can hold fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, and it takes three shifts to fill one, &quot;said David Kladroba, director of the Slovácká Fruta plant.
Farmers, mainly from the Ostrožská and Břeclav regions, transport cabbage heads to the company&#39;s premises directly from their fields.
Fruta&#39;s employees then clean the vegetables, remove the brooms and throw them into the grinder.
From there, the already sliced cabbage falls into pools six meters deep, in which treadmills dressed in white clothes and boots work tirelessly.
This displaces unwanted air.
The last trampled layer of cabbage is covered with a tarpaulin and loaded with water.
&quot;Cabbage crumb then matures for six to eight weeks with spontaneous lactic fermentation without any addition of substances that support fermentation,&quot; stressed the director of Kladrob.
The natural process corresponds to the production at home, the individual layers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
After fermentation, the cabbage travels to the filling line.
It is packed in sweet and sour infusion in bags or glasses and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
He is also interested in it in some other countries, such as Great Britain, Ireland and Canada.
Damkové allegedly forbids UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the referee committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, stopped publishing penalties for judges.
UEFA rules forbid it, as she said in an interview with the daily Právo.
Otherwise, the FACR would be threatened with sanction.
Damková also refused that in her position she would side with the footballers of Pilsen, where she comes from.
These speculations are really meaningless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting, I can lose 1: 6, &quot;Damková said in response to criticism, which raged after Pilsen recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Thus, although in recent months the FACR has stopped publishing penalties for referees, Damková assures that judges complain about their mistakes.
&quot;Believe me, if the commission finds out that the referee has made a mistake, he will restrict his delegation, whatever the match,&quot; Damkova said.
According to Damková, the reason why the penalties are not published is the ban from the European Football Union.
&quot;UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and severely punishes violations.&quot;
&quot;We are very suspicious with us and we are looking for something behind every mistake.&quot;
&quot;We published the restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we don&#39;t stop, harsh sanctions will come,&quot; Damkova said.
Other countries respect the ban.
&quot;We were really an exception,&quot; she added.
If the information continued to be published, the commission could allegedly lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
&quot;And you are very important to us.&quot;
&quot;Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program for the education of judges,&quot; Damková added.
Does the internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Center seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual basic pre-tax profit to be between $ 325 million and $ 340 million, compared to $ 305 million to $ 315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase over a record profit of $ 290.4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Center made an eight percent profit in the first half and began the second half of the year with strong growth, especially in Australian and British off-road travel.
&quot;To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading for record annual pre-interest and tax profits,&quot; he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
The leisure business took off in Australia during the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Center performed well in the recreation area, while corporate clients spent less.
US trade recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to bring a full-year profit for the third time in a row.
Shares of Flight Center were 3 cents higher at $ 38.20 yesterday.
The British police delivered an extradition notice to Assange
British police today delivered a release notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered an &quot;extradition notice&quot; to the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to show up at the police station and that he might face arrest if he did not do so.
Under British law, Assange exhausted his options when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sex crimes.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge on June 19 at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard &quot;delivered a notice of extradition to a 40-year-old man asking him to appear at the police station on the day and time assigned to him,&quot; the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy refused to comment on the delivery notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage because he has published 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The Supreme Court ruled: Nečas can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas can also be prosecuted for possible crimes he may have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS deputies Ivan Fuksa, Marek Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, on the other hand, he decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until they relinquished their parliamentary mandate last November, said Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the court rejected the motion of the public prosecutor Ivo Ištvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the deputies.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative positions in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not making problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to prosecute the former prime minister, who offered them these positions.
Aircraft manufacturers are arguing over seat widths, with large orders at stake
A dispute over second-class seat widths over long-haul flights has erupted among leading aircraft manufacturers, sparking a bitter exchange this month at the Dubai air show.
The subject-matter of the dispute is the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights for economy class - not exactly what airlines would normally have anticipated, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency requirements of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
This week, Airbus called for industry standards that would offer economy-class seats at least 46 cm wide, but major US rival Boeing says airlines should decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers were competing to sell the largest version of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from November 17-21.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is laid out - especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other - is the basis for the economic performance requirements for the design of new &quot;mini-jumbo&quot; aircraft.
Boeing says the improved &quot;777X&quot; will carry 406 people in economy seats more than 43 cm wide, spaced 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out over 9.
Giant planes often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
He recently tentatively showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture of three people crammed into a restaurant with the caption &quot;Would you like it?&quot;
&quot;Boeing promotes long-haul flights in seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft,&quot; said John Leahy, Airbus&#39;s sales manager.
As eating habits change, people are bigger, but seats on airplanes have not changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air travel, the weight of the average American aged 40-49 has increased by 10 percent by the turn of the century, according to the US Department of Health.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has 100 cm at the waist.
Airbus claims that its rival adheres to the concept of seats from the 50s, when the average width of the seats of the newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that suggests that extending the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus&#39; seat dimensions, saying it is not up to aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export charges and equipment.
The company also says research shows that the cabin experience depends on more than just the width of the seat.
&quot;It&#39;s really about giving airlines flexibility and enabling them to do the things they believe they need to do to be successful,&quot; said cabin expert Kent Craver.
They do not want us to dictate to them what brings them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
Greater elbow space is essential for passengers, but it is a growing problem for suppliers that can affect revenue.
Behind this dispute is a plant in aircraft orders with an estimated trade worth at least $ 700 billion in list prices in the coming decades, enough to tip the scales of US and European exports.
According to Reuters in July, the distribution of seats is exactly what is driving the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to be 20 percent more efficient than their market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER, in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs.
Boeing&#39;s performance demands depend in part on a comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weaker compared to the 10-seat concept.
&quot;The reason Boeing is doing this is to cram more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products,&quot; said Kevin Keniston, Airbus&#39; Head of Passenger Comfort for Europe.
Analysts, on the other hand, say that the 10-seater cabs for the existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are in favor of a denser layout, which can go hand in hand with lower charges.
&quot;A forty-five-centimeter-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is motivated by the 777 threat,&quot; said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Traveling aircraft dealers even carry a measuring tape with them to check competing arrangements.
While boasting of convenience, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost airlines and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for greater cockpit modifications by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will remain unheard, but may discourage the 777X wave of sales.
CME will target the television business.
He will release almost a quarter of the people.
The CME media group will lay off.
He wants to lose a thousand people by the end of the year.
He intends to slash all side activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns TV Nova in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME includes CET 21, which holds licenses for the broadcasting of TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
It is not yet clear how much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic number one TV Nova.
&quot;This is premature and we cannot really comment on it,&quot; said Josef Koukolíček, Nova&#39;s director of communications.
According to information from MF DNES, significant redundancies in the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the greatest impact should have on the staffing of CME&#39;s branches in Romania and other countries.
The two new Nova bosses, Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who succeeded longtime director Adrian Sarbu, said during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday that they wanted to curb all activities not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that they will significantly reduce the costs of producing their own programs, filming and production activities.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents for the defunct Nortel company, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, a company it ruled out in a Nortel bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel&#39;s $ 4.5 billion patents, has sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court for Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps to combine Internet search terms with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which is the core of Google&#39;s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that run on Google&#39;s Android operating system, which is in strong competition with Apple and Microsoft&#39;s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $ 900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its bid several times, eventually offering up to $ 4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the fight for Nortel&#39;s patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion, a business motivated in part by Motorola&#39;s patent group.
&quot;Despite the failure to obtain the patents at issue in the auction, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents,&quot; the lawsuit said.
Rockstar seeks increased damages from Google because, in its view, Google&#39;s patent infringement is intentional, as the lawsuit alleges.
George Kerevan: A divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story of independence.
This time, there is a warning that a condition for the membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian&#39;s Wall.
It is true that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but - as expected - this was not reflected in the headlines.
No one has also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if it suits them.
Given that Scotland is not in Schengen now, offering continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it&#39;s a pretty weak story.
Plus, so old that it became an excavation. I heard a press duck that &quot;independence means passport control&quot; at least 40 years ago.
Nevertheless, there is one interesting idea hidden in this bearded story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why exchange the London chomout for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
Due to the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties devoted to opposition to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - founded this year - seemed to come out of nowhere and won almost five million votes in the September federal elections, essentially &quot;sweeping&quot; the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
At home, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the straitjacket strung on national economies through adherence to the common currency, have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running high budget deficits - this was only true of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters - and German politicians want to keep that.
Without the possibility of devaluing the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenues and public spending - as Germany is urging.
Behind the current budget and currency problems is a deeper cause of Europe&#39;s sluggish performance.
As a result of the &quot;green&quot; energy policy supported by Brussels - a code to support French and German companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for petrol as in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even any wage freeze in the world would not avert the stagnation of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the USA.
The result is a smoldering riot, especially in France, once an ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool to keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand up to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as proof of political legitimacy and has pushed its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen&#39;s right wing, the anti-European National Front, had just won a major by-election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - an early warning to British Labor that they cannot assume that the division of the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newfound popularity among the white working class?
It would like to use next year&#39;s European elections to create an anti-European bloc against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
At the same time, it occurs to me that in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will unite and destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but rather transform into something freer in the sense of a &quot;Europe of (sovereign) nations&quot;, which General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
However, Washington&#39;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left cold in the Atlantic.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (basically) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests - this includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when to leave us.
I assume that Scotland would do well in a relaxed order of Europe, provided that it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should follow the example of Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - surprisingly - the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, winning by a large majority in 2011 due to opposition to the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labor Chancellor Alistair Darling and subsequent coalitions of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence just to take the austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Parents of intersex children can choose &quot;indefinite gender&quot;
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize the third sex in children born with an ambiguous gender.
Newborns will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to state any gender for such children and allows them to list gender as &quot;indeterminate&quot; or &quot;unspecified&quot; on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pressuring parents to rush their child&#39;s sex surgery and to combat discrimination against those who are intersex.
According to the BBC, one intersex person said after many years: &quot;I am neither male nor female.&quot;
I will remain a concoction created by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that each year, out of 2,000 children, one is born who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall into the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed genitals.
Intersex could be Wallis Simpson.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information and determine it, rather than waiting and monitoring the child&#39;s psychological and physical development until it is done. operations, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender determination problems, said the new German law &quot;looks like a good thing.&quot;
Intersex children present an ethical dilemma.
&quot;Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not,&quot; he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery, and then the identity can wait as the identity develops.
Knowledge of how a child&#39;s gender develops is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It&#39;s like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, as their status is not linked to gender, but to their biological structure, which is neither male nor female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as none of them.
These traits may be reflected in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and figure, in primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys of no gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to indicate male, female or &quot;third sex&quot; in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world&#39;s first recognized &quot;asexual&quot; person in June when she won a court appeal to retain &quot;indefinite&quot; gender status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, in addition to M (male) and F (female), German passports will also have a third, X, for intersex people.
In neighboring France, according to a news report on France 24, the issue of gender is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strongly Catholic country signed a petition to remove &quot;gender theory&quot; from school textbooks.
The American online Catholic website also commented on German law and wrote, &quot;As the world is dragged to a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization upside down.&quot;
One mother of a newborn from Maryland also told the Baby zone that she would rather see the babies given gender at birth.
&quot;Parenting itself is stressful without further restrictions, especially if you don&#39;t know your child&#39;s gender,&quot; she said of a website about parental care.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, both male and female children were called hermaphrodites, after the handsome Greek, who had a dual sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that gender was like a blackboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of surgery, saying that gender is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel about their gender when they grow up.
&quot;In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,&quot; Drescher said.
When these children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
Persistent theories about how to treat children of the ambiguous sex were put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was flexible.
He created a new notion of &quot;gender&quot; and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment - how parents raised their children - affected children&#39;s genes and hormones and shaped the child, regardless of whether he was identified as male or female.
But in one 1966 case, known as &quot;John / Joan,&quot; his theory became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to a poor circumcision to have their child completely castrated, to remove his testicles and to raise him as a girl.
&quot;The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,&quot; Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had himself transferred to the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors &quot;use this model&quot; to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations emerged &quot;dissatisfied with the outcome.&quot;
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous genital system.
Doctors were not sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a &quot;satisfying life.&quot;
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce had his external organs and testicles surgically removed and raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
&quot;I knew I wasn&#39;t a girl,&quot; he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18 he was sent for a vaginal plastic surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
I was sterilized after birth and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a developmental disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to develop its genitals properly.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took doses of testosterone, and had his breasts removed,
The operations caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and seeks to normalize the perceptions of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based Advocates for Informed Choice Legal Group, fears that German law &quot;calls for calibration and stigma.&quot;
&quot;Many activists fear that German law will encourage parents to make a quick decision and choose &#39;indefinite&#39; for the child,&quot; she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we don&#39;t know how the law will end in the end, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported Australian law because it &quot;allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex.&quot;
&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legal sex,&quot; she said.
German law is going to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not wage at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh chest radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in a support group, said German law would &quot;give powers&quot; to both parents and children.
Baratz&#39;s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie developed female traits.
He has a vagina but no uterus and ovaries.
Katie, 29, is now married and working as a child psychiatrist during her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
&quot;The law will give parents some room not to hurry,&quot; Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and think it over, and it gives them time to write &quot;man&quot; or &quot;woman.&quot;
In this respect, everything is fine - you raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful child and you enjoy it.
You don&#39;t have to rush with an operation that is irreversible.
&quot;It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure that they are doing the right thing,&quot; she said.
In the end, the child decides which gender he identifies with more - and that&#39;s a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into the wild
The bird was transported to shore after being found depleted on an oil rig in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One rattlesnake was transported by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being previously treated by the Scottish SPCA at a rescue center until it recovered.
Colin Seddon said: &quot;This rattlesnake probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea.&quot;
Apparently he ran out of strength and took refuge on an oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added: &quot;He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help.&quot;
By the time the rattlesnake was released, he was in good shape and health.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders, who will reconstruct the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Together with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jeseník at a time (from a geological point of view) recent.
The last eruptions were still here at the beginning of the Quaternary.
When viewed from a greater distance, on the top of Uhlířský vrch there is a striking white-plastered pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary Help of Christians, built between 1755 and 1765.
It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn next to the church has not survived.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley of four rows of linden trees, about 1 km long, was planted.
The Stations of the Cross on Uhlířský vrch is already the third version, the original stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
There are wooden sculptures made by local artistic carver František Nedomlel at fifteen stops.
He used various species of woody plants from the Low Jeseník area.
Similarly, pedestals made of rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor is also given at each stop.
Uhlířský vrch is a remnant of a young volcano.
Although data from radiometric age measurements differ somewhat, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than Velký Roudný (3.3 million years old) and older than Venus Volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born by an explosion.
During it, it expelled a considerable amount of volcanic ash, together with fragments of rocks from the subsoil, which acquired a reddish-brown color by burning.
At the end of this phase, lava flowed to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters thick.
The second eruption ejected red, brown-red and sometimes black tuffs.
Their layer is up to 50 meters thick and part of it is accessible in the quarry wall.
Volcanic bombs up to 1 meter in size are conspicuous in the tuffs. The second eruption was also ended by a lava flow.
At the end of the activity, lava flowed out of the volcano, which today forms a layer of slag-like basalt up to 50 m thick.
Volcanoes, in which the ejection of volcanic ash alternates with lava flows, are the most common type of volcano.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they were named stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone gradually eroded.
However, it was endangered by rock mining in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tuffs were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
The mining was stopped under pressure from experts and the public, thus preserving this unique place.
However, the problem is in the porosity and low cohesion of the rocks, which quickly weather, disintegrate and slide down the slope.
The quarry disappears relatively quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The remedy is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained at a number of important sites.
You can get to Uhlířský vrch following the green tourist sign from Bruntál, or from Slezský Kočov.
Motorists can use the free car park at the beginning of the linden alley, where a short nature trail begins.
The drunk poured gasoline on the whole house: He threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
The tension was rising, the fear was escalating.
The man began to threaten to set the whole house on fire.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area went to the site, as well as a fire brigade unit from Mladá Boleslav and a volunteer fire brigade unit.
A police negotiator arrived on the scene, trying to tell the man his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
An intervention unit had to break into the house, neutralizing and handcuffing the man.
The aggressor then ended up for an examination at the Mladá Boleslav hospital, from where he was transported to an anti-alcohol detention center.
The firefighters eventually filled the house covered with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition to people, all domestic animals were rescued from the house.
The man did not put a man on the police negotiator, so a commando went after him.
Anger over the verdict handed down against the perpetrator of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angrily to a verdict against the last of the perpetrators brought to justice, saying Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for assembling explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
He could be released on parole in 15 years.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The indictment demanded life imprisonment, although it could insist that a man nicknamed &quot;Demolition man&quot; be sentenced to death because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
The decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other contenders almost ten years ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Mrs. Corteen said, &quot;He should be faced with an execution squad.&quot;
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when, on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a heavy bomb placed in a parked van was detonated.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy&#39;s Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while being kept alive, he &quot;died&quot; three times from doctors.
Mr Hughes said Pateka should face the same fate as the three other members of the Jama Islami terrorist cell responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
This guy should be sentenced to death like no one.
Keeping him alive ... there&#39;s no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more is not so much.
Patek was on trial as the last of the assassins in Bali.
He avoided the arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, US forces killed former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
&quot;He did not give up voluntarily,&quot; said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt sorry for how much grief he has caused others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year and which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
&quot;We will see a lot of tears this year,&quot; said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against the judgment.
Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis would appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
The cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the pope and are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis appoints his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope - the group is reduced to 120 electoral cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that before the ceremonial promotion of the new cardinals, there would be an assembly of the current cardinals known as the Consistory.
&quot;Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other gatherings that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,&quot; Lombardi said.
Jack Voero of Catholic Voices said the number of electoral cardinals is likely to fall by February.
He said the pope usually appointed as many cardinals as needed to increase the number of voters again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
The consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, Europe and especially Italy.
&quot;It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,&quot; he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to find ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided everything for himself.
&quot;Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,&quot; Valero said.
He said it was &quot;quite possible&quot; for the pope to ask these cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is completely new.
Valero said popes had traditionally promoted bishops from large places to position as cardinals, but Francis was &quot;full of surprises - so we don&#39;t know who he names.&quot;
Land Rover series announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercommunication equipment.
You can choose from improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between races.
Drew Bowler, CTO of Bowler Motorsport, said: &quot;The riders who come to Bowler have changed.&quot;
Not everyone is an experienced racer, but they are people who want excitement and adventure, as well as an affordable path to world-class racing.
We are delighted to be able to offer them this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it prepares competitors for the harshness and reality of Rally Raid racing.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week&#39;s Strings of Autumn
Saxophone giant and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will put an end to the 18th Strings of Autumn Festival next Wednesday.
Shorter will perform on November 6 in the Great Hall of the Lantern with his quartet of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, he will join Shorter with the spontaneous jazz improvisation of PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter&#39;s arrangements for the symphony orchestra will feature Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of energy, as evidenced by the fact that the Prague concert at Strings of Autumn will start his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he has collaborated with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and the Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom they set the direction of a new style of fusion in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the last thirteen years, he has performed mainly with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
A kind of afterparty after the festival will be the Spotlight club night, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy / NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triana, the Manchester audience will be introduced to the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz influenced by electronics and the young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz band Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American commando in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis showed exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, the planes sent, hit the target and returned.
Without being lulled by the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of confused and big-mouthed, unsubstantiated actions by Obama&#39;s Syrian policies.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don&#39;t be fooled by the media&#39;s claims that a &quot;Syrian base&quot; or &quot;supplies for Hezbollah&quot; has been bombed.
I recently wrote here that while US aid to secular insurgents in the country remains rhetorical, Russia happily continues to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was a fresh delivery of Russian missiles unloaded at the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli raid.
A clear message.
And note, Israel has again bombed Assad&#39;s regime, not the insurgents, although according to popular Internet theories, it should be the other way around.
The US government honored 2 members of special forces, probably the Delta Force.
It has not been known until now that they excelled during the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA complex in the city is known, in my opinion they were members of the secret CIA commando, which is made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated what the SEALs did at the consulate or even at the CIA&#39;s residence elsewhere.
It&#39;s clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA in Libya has its offices protected by machine-gun nests (just one of them, both members of the SEALs died after being hit by a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of the American commando in Tripoli, and as soon as they received news of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, made their way to the CIA campus in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is embarrassed by the fact that the commando was not officially deployed during the attack and that it simply hesitated.
The commander of the commando will probably release these volunteers without orders.
In any case, the fact that American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors operate in the country not once, but permanently is quite interesting information.
This is due to the fact that until recently, nothing like this was officially acknowledged, and even now there is only talk of a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the USA is trying to fight terrorism in Libya, even half-heartedly.
Although it would take much more help to resolve the national situation.
The last place in the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost sang about the Iranian Air Force for chasing American drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to be able to find your drone in the airspace, there&#39;s nothing you can do about it.
However, if a drone is discovered by Iranians in the international arena, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom aircraft chased the American drone in the international space over the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He flew Phantom to visually verify his armament without Phantom registering him on the radar or simply noticing him, and then when he suddenly appeared at him and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed without grumbling.
Not surprisingly, the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can&#39;t compare to the Raptor.
The court blocked an order concerning the procedure for stopping and searching persons by the NY police department
The Federal Court of Appeals on Thursday blocked a court order requiring changes to the arrest and search program at the New York Police Department and appealed the judge.
The second U.S. Federal Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin&#39;s decision would be postponed until the city&#39;s appeal decision.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city challenged its findings and its corrective regulations, including the decision to assign oversight to help the police department change its procedures and their associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal said the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges by failing to act as a judge to avoid the appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements responded to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search people.
It has set up independent oversight to oversee major changes, including reform of procedures, training and surveillance, and has ordered the launch of a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
An oral justification for the city&#39;s appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.
Tactics of arresting and searching people have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
There has been some form of stopping and searching for about a decade, but recorded searches under independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have risen dramatically to a record 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to minorities, filed a lawsuit, which became a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NY Police Department&#39;s Arrest and Search Program argue that the changes will put an end to unfair practices, increase police credibility and efficiency, and may affect how other police departments use these practices.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that this will waste money, but will not solve the wider problem of the police force being under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand in the last decade.
The judge noted that she had not ended the practice of stopping and searching persons, which is constitutional, but was reforming the way the NY Police Department had conducted searches.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools regarding allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help with children&#39;s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the US government, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children&#39;s food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also encourages schools to have adrenaline - the most commonly used EpiPen automatic injector - to be able to respond to a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislators have recently updated rules that make it easier for schools to store adrenaline.
The report also lists typical symptoms that appear in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say, &quot;It&#39;s as if someone stabbed me in the tongue,&quot; &quot;I feel like I have hair on my tongue,&quot; or &quot;My tongue itches.&quot;
How Tipsport (does not) delete personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on the Tipsport.cz website.
However, I did not finish it subsequently, because there was someone sitting at the branch who could not complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn&#39;t want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved and thanks to that my address and ID card number changed.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it was not possible because I had a different OP number, address and that it was simply not possible to complete it and that I should ask to delete the data and make a new registration.
So I did that and on October 24, 2013 I wrote to the technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database according to the valid law on personal data protection.
On that long day, technical support wrote to me that I had to complete the registration at the branch.
This started the marathon of e-mails for technical support, where in the end, after the 4th urban 25.10. they wrote that they deleted the personal data at my request.
So one would think that he could do the new registration and here the problems started again, it first wrote me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not personal data, but in the end they also discarded this).
So I used a different username and it jumped out that my personal information was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have something stored that they said they deleted?), So I contacted technical support again.
When I asked how it was possible, they wrote back that they had actually deleted my personal data on 25.10. and to send an email with that error.
I did that (yesterday around 3 pm) and today I was told that I registered the same day (October 31, 2013) at 13.22 and that therefore it is not possible, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I have been contacting technical support for a week and I am working with them that it is still not possible.
And what about the fact that if what is claimed is true (as it is not) no one with the same name or the same date of birth could register if this is already registered.
Just by the way, at 13.22 I actually registered, for the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and phone number and wonder of the world, a page appeared that sent me a link to complete the registration by e-mail.
But how is this possible if you cannot register with the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds the registration to an e-mail and phone number and simply did not discard the data as he claims.
So again, I told technical support that they were just lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they were writing), because what they were writing was not true.
I have documented several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so &quot;fake&quot; registration simply doesn&#39;t affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a stern sentence - I&#39;m sorry, but since you&#39;re registered again, we can&#39;t verify your claim.
And he ended the communication.
Respectively, it repeats over and over the same sentence that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They can&#39;t even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and so it didn&#39;t actually take place.
So to sum it up, Tipsport not only did not delete the data as it claims, but also lies when it claims otherwise.
What&#39;s worse is that it&#39;s easy to prove how they&#39;re lying and trying to make it look like the fault is on the customer&#39;s side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things got a little moving and from Technical Support came an e-mail that they were submitting the matter for review and I would be informed (after a week of urgency and guessing and notification of the same error).
We are sorry for the killing, but we are innocent, the Khmer Rouge leaders are defending themselves
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge government, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, at least a quarter of the population, lost their lives to exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and executions.
The commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to life in prison in 2010 by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and unaware of the true extent of the killings.
&quot;It&#39;s easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and therefore intervened and rectified the situation,&quot; Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority, &quot;he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered Khmer Rouge cadres to &quot;mistreat or kill people, deny them food or commit genocide.&quot;
But he admitted &quot;moral responsibility&quot; for the dead.
&quot;I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, their families, all the Cambodian people,&quot; he said.
Bin Sivla, 55, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Che&#39;s apology. &quot;
&quot;He lied to us.&quot;
&quot;He just wants to be acquitted.&quot;
&quot;She doesn&#39;t care about others,&quot; she said.
&quot;If he did not issue orders, his subordinates would not kill,&quot; she added, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were &quot;worse than monsters.&quot;
Ieng Sara, the &quot;foreign minister&quot; of the Khmer Rouge regime, who died in March this year, was also due to appear in court.
In September 2012, his wife, Ieng Thirith, the then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incompetent due to dementia.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream that glows in the dark - using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a fluorescent treat.
He came up with the idea when he read a dissertation on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically produce a protein that causes fluorescence.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer&#39;s tongue - it raises the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes it to radiate.
Chris says that ice cream glows when it reacts with the heat of your mouth, so the more you lick, the brighter it glows.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company &quot;Lick me I&#39;m delicious&quot;, says: &quot;It&#39;s an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we&#39;re at the beginning, so for £ 200 you get about 2 g of this substance. &quot;
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH rises and the ice cream begins to glow.
We&#39;ve been testing it over the last few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic radiant effect.
It&#39;s probably the most expensive ice cream I&#39;ve ever made, because jellyfish are four times more expensive than gold.
And so each mound costs me about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie&#39;s experimental company based in Bristol is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is to be even more ambitious.
He says, &quot;I really want to make an invisible ice cream.&quot;
In essence, this is impossible due to the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I expect that we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Ski resorts want to be cheaper for families with children
The price of oil fell further to $ 96 a barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about high stocks were offset by a report showing a strengthening of China&#39;s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The US oil indicator for December deliveries fell late in the European electronic trading on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $ 96.24 per barrel.
The decline was 39 cents on Thursday and fell 5.8 percent for October.
Rich oil reserves have weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that US reserves had risen by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production gave rise to higher demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China&#39;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growing to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after two previous decades of weakness.
Brent crude, an indicator for international crude oil also used by US refineries, fell 26 cents to $ 108.58 a barrel on the London International Trade Exchange.
Martin Doktor on problems with the Sochi Olympics: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he takes a deep breath, &quot;It&#39;s challenging.&quot;
According to Martin Doktor, cooperation with the organizing team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a bit more complicated.
We can forget what was at the last Olympics.
&quot;Nothing works the same way,&quot; says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
Many things work more slowly and not exactly.
It&#39;s so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of delivering information on essential matters, not so much.
For example, we have been liking them for three months now to give us how the individual villages will be officially marked, so that we can do a whole range of things accordingly.
We&#39;re still waiting, and they&#39;re still saying they&#39;re communicating.
They still communicate in many things.
Is the Olympic Village at least already completed?
But it is no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago, we walked around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean that they are empty?
Do you need finished floors?
Only the base concrete, that is the state a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there is a danger that when we get there as a vanguard on January 26, he will still smell the glue.
And if they didn&#39;t catch up, what would it be?
Would President Putin think he would drive an army there?
That&#39;s exactly how it will turn out.
Just so it&#39;s not that the Olympic Village = Potemkin Village.
Rather, they risk not having time to edit roads, for example, to finish details.
They may have their travels in such a state that we will have to take the boots from the London Games with us.
But I believe that they will somehow put it together.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
There are now about 78 of them, although the number varies depending on the nomination criteria.
For example, figure skaters will probably ride in the trio they rode.
Nobody has to doubt the speed skater Martina Sáblíková, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still waiting for the trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I shouldn&#39;t fly there until January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things with the subway ourselves, so as not to believe only the sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what is the head of mission doing a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am doing a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Place post-election sirloin post-election stew
The October election brought a bunch of losers rather than winners.
These are not only parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (eg SPOZ), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the CSSD due to its internal split.
Politicians served us a post-election goulash on the weekend instead of a festive sirloin steak.
Andrej Babiš&#39;s movement became a jumper of the election, promising voters to change the current political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party records the political (of) will of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the president has lost his strategic advantage over other politicians due to the unpleasant event, he still has several ways to regain him - for example, by choosing the future prime minister.
While the CSSD has given up the chances of winning the prime minister&#39;s seat in my eyes, they are bringing entrepreneurs Andrej Babiš closer.
Although post-election development is still miles away from the early and smooth formation of a stable government, compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing CSSD government supported by the Communists, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy.
Due to the loud resistance YES to get together with the ODS or TOP 09, the coalition of the CSSD, ANO and KDU-CSL (still a total of 111 deputies) is still the most probable variant.
Due to the split in the CSSD, which thus became an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the result of the coalition negotiations can be quite depressing for the CSSD.
The CSSD minority government composed of &quot;non-Slavs&quot; at the Castle will probably not pass.
In addition, any government in which the CSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, &quot;Shall we not rush to the next early election?&quot;
The next election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the YES movement&#39;s electoral mandate.
The CSSD&#39;s plans to introduce sector taxes, a more significant increase in income taxes or the building of a state bank have hopefully fallen under the table.
On the other hand, the CSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit parties agree, for example, on business support, sober fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), support for the employment of disadvantaged people, and a reduction in the lower VAT rate on selected goods.
Frictions are most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
But YES is on top now, so the program of the most probable coalition so far YES, CSSD, KDU-CSL would be more to the right.
Which, in my opinion, is a better result in the end than a left-wing program with a tax on everything that is still moving in the economy.
Until recently, it seemed that most citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
The reasons given were corruption, wasting money on overpriced purchases and government contracts, raising taxes and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the election results, it can be concluded that this situation suited most citizens.
That they didn&#39;t really mind and that they were actually satisfied with the state that was there (theft and indebtedness of this state).
Otherwise, I can&#39;t explain that 3,413,497 voters did not go to the polls, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted by the ODS, so a total of 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all valid voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
If I add 1,016,829 CSSD voters to the above-mentioned parties, then with the old order (because all the above-mentioned parties participated in the &quot;theft&quot; and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of legitimate voters actually agreed with this situation.
In fact, most voters have made it clear that they are not in favor of punishing and over-indebteding the perpetrators of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the CSSD who took part in it will stand up for the relevant laws?
Can we help at all?
Olomouc will open a public ice rink in the historic center
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating, Pavel Spálený, stated that the preparatory work on the ice rink began on October 26, and an ice-making unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The rink has an area of 375 square meters, the podium occupied 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two stalls with punch.
&quot;We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands and almost the entire area of the stage is covered so that skaters can change their shoes comfortably,&quot; Spálený described.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on Horní náměstí due to the repair of Dolní náměstí.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate right in front of the town hall in 2009, when the rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice rink then became an integral part of the city&#39;s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will open on the Upper Square a month before Christmas.
The researchers shed more light on how the movements of the tail are related to the dog&#39;s mood
Previous research has shown that joyful dogs wag their tail more to the right (from the dog&#39;s point of view), while nervous dogs wave their tail mostly to the left.
However, scientists now say that other dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: &quot;It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain have different links to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions.&quot;
We have tried to observe the same in other species.
He added that, as in humans, dogs in the right side of the brain are responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
In an effort to learn more about how dogs respond to the asymmetrical wagging of other dogs&#39; tails, researchers monitored animals that watched films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won&#39;t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: &quot;We have shown films about dogs to dogs - either in their natural version or in the form of a silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and show it more to the right or left.&quot;
When the animals saw an otherwise indistinct dog move its tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog wagging its tail), it remained completely still.
However, when she noticed the turning of the tail mostly to the left (again from the point of view of a dog wagging its tail), their heart rate increased and the animals looked uncertain.
Professor Vallortigar said that he did not think that dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and which they do not have to pay attention to.
He said: &quot;If you meet dogs several times and moving their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and moving to the right produces less friendly behavior, you will respond based on this experience.&quot;
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a college veterinary teacher at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to look at whether the left and right sides were important to dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when watching an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a cheerful dog.
And in another dissertation from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: &quot;Dogs were more likely to get acquainted with a dog robot when it wagged its tail to the left than to the right, when they became more insecure - quite the opposite of the Italian study.&quot;
According to him, the difference may be given by the fact that dogs in these various studies did not interpret animals in movies or dog robots completely like dogs.
He explained that a study on how dogs respond to real dogs could help.
&quot;Although there is strong evidence for many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won&#39;t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
RBS suspends two foreign currency traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign exchange division, further indicating that global investigations by supervisory authorities of suspected currency market machinations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world&#39;s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the world&#39;s largest financial market, where they change owners every day with $ 5.3 trillion.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in an expanding investigation in response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interest Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
&quot;Our ongoing search for this matter continues, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,&quot; the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the incident said RBS handed over records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to the accounts of the former trader to the British Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to be relieved of his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi&#39;s European chairman of cash trading, took leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders was charged with any offense.
Mr. Usher&#39;s instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people told by the insider.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced that it was investigating suspected foreign currency market machinations in several Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations that these bankers have joined forces to move with the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combing years with quick messages and e-mails to find cases of any breaches.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest profit-making engines of investment bank closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by low currency volatility limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have sought to reduce the gravity of the situation by arguing that a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say this may not necessarily be the case.
A senior trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign currency trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that &quot;you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices.&quot;
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired a stock trader from its stock trading department this week, which caused a loss of nearly $ 6 million late last year.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
&quot;We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem was solved,&quot; said Credit Suisse.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and Špidla.
Now the People&#39;s Party sent Jan Kasal against Babiš.
The People&#39;s Party won fourteen deputies in the elections, ie only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of YES.
However, they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to speculate on the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who tuned the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006 for the People&#39;s Party.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
This time it will probably be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
&quot;Experience was minimal then,&quot; Kasal estimates as this year&#39;s talks develop.
The driver was fined £ 1,000 for driving over 200 km / h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined £ 1,000 for driving up to 210 km / h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, as a result of which he received a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of £ 90 and the surcharge for the accused to £ 100.
Prospal: I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have juice, lust and enthusiasm
For Prospala, the family has always been in the first place, so at the age of 38 he wants to submit to it.
He will either get a job overseas and prolong his career, or he will definitely quit hockey.
&quot;I want to play the role of dad and husband.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m really looking forward to it,&quot; says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite being a renowned hard worker who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and is able to pull down his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus&#39; most productive player last season.
&quot;But the desire to show everyone is still in me,&quot; he says firmly.
He may survive, allegedly for the New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and also have two injuries injured - attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like when you come to Rangers?
It&#39;s just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there&#39;s no point in dealing with it.
I know an article was published in the New York Post that they should sign me, but that&#39;s it.
Nowhere has it been added that this really happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce that I have a contract, but it just isn&#39;t.
Didn&#39;t they even call you from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
It&#39;s about getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When, for example, a player is injured or someone can&#39;t do it and the team doesn&#39;t step on it.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get that contract.
But that&#39;s exactly what happens in New York, right?
Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan are injured and the team didn&#39;t make it to the season, so there&#39;s a chance, don&#39;t you think?
Of course, there is always a chance.
But the second thing is that you always need two sides to do it.
I would take a lot of offers today, but I haven&#39;t received any yet.
Unfortunately, that is the reality in which I have to live.
You fly to America on Friday, do you expect anything to happen?
I&#39;ve had the expectations since July 5, when the NHL market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to be reminded?
Certainly not, I&#39;m going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I&#39;m looking forward to the sun and see you again.
Do you have a program planned for it?
He is given by the fact that I am a father and a husband and everything is based on that.
I&#39;m not a hockey player at the moment - I don&#39;t have a contract and I don&#39;t play matches.
So I&#39;m going to play the role of dad and husband and I&#39;m really looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday, Vašík has two hockey matches, it is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go and support our children in what they want to do.
Do you think you could do this in full-time quotes?
Sure, one can think about a lot of things.
This too can happen.
I tried it three years ago, when I missed 50 games due to knee surgery.
And I really enjoyed it.
Once it gets to such a stage that all the goals, victories and passes will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that&#39;s the meaning of life.
Get the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: do you mean that you want to play the NHL just because it&#39;s the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
As a hockey player, the first place - apart from my family - is sports success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that&#39;s where family life unfolds.
My children, so sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we would very much like them to continue this trend.
Because what we&#39;re talking about, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else entirely.
We should offer them such a chance.
So do you plan to stay in America permanently?
We will practice it as before.
This means that in the summer we will be in the Czech Republic in Hluboká and in the vicinity of České Budějovice.
And in the winter again in Tampa or where our steps will take us.
It is absolutely ideal to be always warm.
I was very lucky in life.
You could say that I went to meet him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation and it took a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey in turn offered me a lot of options and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who long for this so that they can choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have at your age the will to work, train hard and wait for an offer?
Yeah, so that&#39;s a question I can&#39;t answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. The desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL, that I&#39;m still better than anyone else.
But I can&#39;t say how long it will stay there.
That can&#39;t be planned.
So you can say that this season you wait, how it turns out, and then you decide what to do next?
I&#39;m at a stage where I&#39;m going from day to day.
Distant planets, black-and-white films, or a bit of fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that the American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would casually throw up.
According to his quartet, which will end this year&#39;s Strings of Autumn festival on November 6 in the large hall of the Prague Lantern, everything is related to everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the current feelings of the musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues should play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and have to think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
However, the newly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, nine Grammy winner, former teammate of Miles Davis and today probably the greatest living jazz saxophonist - does not like to explain this principle.
He doesn&#39;t talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of eighty, I came to the conclusion that it was best to be surprised by life.
&quot;Too many people plan everything and then they are disappointed when things turn out differently,&quot; says Shorter.
Jágr joked: Goal from break?
He won the puck in the defensive zone and no one caught him anymore.
In addition, he turned the leak into a fast forehand loop.
Jaromír Jágr scored like this against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday evening he commented on the 119th winning goal in the NHL on the social network Facebook.
&quot;After watching this video, the director of Czech Railways called my agent Petr Svoboda and asked him if I would be interested in advertising on their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!&quot; wrote at the beginning with exaggeration Jágr.
They say we are very similar in type.
I&#39;ll probably have to finish night training so I don&#39;t accelerate even more.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid the Minister of Defense might call after him and want to advertise the jets!&quot; added smileys.
In addition, New Jersey claimed its second victory in a row.
&quot;And most importantly, you noticed - Maria Rottr&#39;s treatment works,&quot; Jagr concluded.
The brutal murder of a senior in the Zlín region will again be dealt with by the regional court
The regional court acquitted the 25-year-old Slovak and the 22-year-old Czech about the lack of evidence.
The men denied guilt.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the high court overturned the regional decision and returned the case to him for consideration.
The judge declined to comment on the reasons that led to this, stating that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the indictment, the young men assaulted a seventy-seven-year-old man in his house.
Senior died a torturous death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled him, beat him and kicked him all over his body, and he also inflicted about thirty blows to his head with a metal object, probably a gas pistol.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull, brain swelling or bleeding into the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
The young people allegedly took about 3,000 crowns from the house and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns.
According to the regional court, the only, moreover, only indirect evidence against the defendants was odor traces, which the expert assessed as not completely ascertained in the sense of the legal instructions.
The odor traces from the crime scene and other cases coincided with the defendants in more than ten cases, but the police initially treated them as factual and not odor traces.
In addition, certain errors were found in their handling.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was undoubtedly proved.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he must have fallen and injured himself.
The emergency service doctor did not even point out the violent death.
Only a few days later, the doctors were contacted by Olomouc doctors, who discovered signs of violent death during an autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the traces of the crime scene that the relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in the Uherské Hradiště region.
He is currently serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was finally confirmed by the Olomouc High Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who are responsible for robberies of a goldsmith.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopný.
The younger of the accused of murdering a senior lives in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Will Czech Television ever do without signing events?
She entered the era of President Zeman with a legendary scene with an ashtray, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that gather evidence of the exploitation of the castle troupe.
In the past, no one has documented the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík in this way, let alone signed it up.
True, the editors took the lead.
However, the cases described do not provide an answer to the question of where such a tendency of some journalists towards the Zemans comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order or, not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathic helpfulness.
And if we assume general rottenness, one cannot forgive the question of whether other, no less unscrupulous power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity, are seeking to change the situation on television.
Those who say that there are no eye-catching attempts by politicians to intervene in broadcasting are right.
However, the truth is also that this does not mean that there are no complaints against the public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be a tendency inherent in them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just haven&#39;t reached this stage of civilization yet, and this situation isn&#39;t with us.
But perhaps even in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable spent than more complicated descriptions of the confusing situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings.
As crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet going to school and only took a few steps a few months ago, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, skidded smoothly through three rounds to eventually win the top prize, leaving 30 dragging adult rivals behind.
This inseparable pair - of equal height - was praised for their looks, behavior and style at the annual Sunnybank Equestrian Center competition in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He stood against the men and ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret to a cheerful angle and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control the horse, which is far beyond his age.
And Toffee received the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee for his third birthday in March and has been training with this Shetland pony ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, &quot;Fenton and Toffee work together great.&quot;
They did not have high hopes, but in the end they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone considered him phenomenal and completely strangers wanted to take pictures with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showcasing horses for over 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says: &quot;There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was cheering and applauding.&quot;
He ran along the sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors and a farm and has been in charge of two chickens.
Since he started, he will be in the Horse of the Year competition again soon and I&#39;m sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, &quot;There are only three Fentons, but he already knows how to control a pony.&quot;
They make a great team together.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork between the pony and the leader is - and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oval.
I&#39;m sure Fenton was helped by his adorable clothes, he really fit in with him.
Snowden is willing to &quot;cooperate&quot; with Germany in connection with surveillance by the United States
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence cracker, said he was willing to go to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to answer questions about their activities.
On Thursday, German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the MP handed over to the media on Friday in Berlin, states: &quot;Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as a fugitive and tries to criminalize political speeches with grave lawsuits that leave no room. for the defense. &quot;
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the criminal charges against him.
Allegations made by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany&#39;s interior minister, told Zeit Online: &quot;If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.&quot;
Tensions between the United States and Germany began to rise as claims emerged that the NSA was tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel overseeing intelligence, said that if there was any opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness &quot;without endangering him and destroying relations with the United States&quot;, he should would do so.
Mr Sträbele, a Member of Parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of Mr Snowden on his twitter post.
He was accompanied on his journey to Russia by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia once he left.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need reassurance that he would be &quot;safe&quot; there, a member of parliament said.
In his letter, Mr Snowden said he faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
However, he said that the reaction of the whole world to his &quot;act of political expression&quot; gave him courage.
Citizens throughout and senior officials - including those in the United States - have praised the revelation of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to work with the German authorities, &quot;until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.&quot;
So as not to choke on hatred
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, VÁCLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel, Wind, Darkness, Presence.
The number of pages comparable to his most famous work Houština (Petrov, 2001) suggests that it will not be a small volume.
Another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl - testified for Salon Kahudu.
What happened where you wrote the novel after twelve years of silence?
I did it - so as not to choke on hatred.
To see around him new and new clones of human foolish pettiness, young organisms affected by blind selfish effort.
I&#39;m not even talking about the elders, faces ruined by helpless lust, soulful souls and reversed polarity ideologues who are trying to sell their &quot;product&quot; with the expression of a little saleswoman.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my annoying friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
It&#39;s over for me.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning out of life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks and then read books by the lamp in the evening.
You talk about feeling frustrated, hated.
Was there a turning point in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The turning point came a long time ago, at about ten years.
It didn&#39;t have a name then.
Well, I lived after that.
But somewhere inside, there&#39;s still a surprised silent boy.
I see other lone exercisers, each in their tornado of anxiety.
Writing books saved me.
I am participating in this vast, thousand-year-old movement of the life system on this planet - the birth of an elusive future.
The immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir of our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, where, through trial and error, more and more generations of beings are created, which in trillions of interactions per second create some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you perceive your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather dialogue, which is conducted by the right and left halves of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
Just as periods of peace are interwoven with quietly sleeping metastases of wars that may one day awaken - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt a dumb avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I didn&#39;t do anything, one day it would quietly overwhelm me.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and posed to layers that are stored in the darkness &quot;below the surface of consciousness&quot;.
The neocortex, the gray cortex, asks for older evolutionary formations, going to the ancient annual rings of the cerebral tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks of snakes, seeks an answer in the flight of birds, raises his gaze to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
Eventually, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself metaphorically to the ego - could you define it biologically?
In its billions of connections and electrochemical connections, the brain preserves all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has had.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, registers of memory, uses the brain in its cognitive, cognitive, process, exposed to a constantly changing presence, in a relentless effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes overload faults occur.
By analogy - as if your PC had &quot;fallen&quot;, you would first get confused from a speech emulator and foreign language compiler program in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarts, it would end up with a dark green blinking Bios screen, a basic system that controls functions. and collaboration on the motherboard, between the processor and RAM, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about - I am talking about a psychospiritual crisis.
You mention her often - why are you interested in this type of regression on a regular basis?
Because it&#39;s a pit.
A gap will appear in the hitherto functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: &quot;He stared into the abyss until he looked into it.&quot;
Pure feeling - that a person is lost, if all hopes disappear, he mentally &quot;dies&quot; and a new quality begins.
And why am I interested personally?
I will answer with a parable.
Once one fell into a pool and drowned, days, months, and years ran, he kept drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim — that is, to live.
He became a &quot;diver&quot;.
Perhaps a sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal&#39;s lyrics once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about whom nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, the other a super ego, but in my opinion Arthur Rimbaud best described it in a letter to a friend:
&quot;I&#39;m someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences.&quot;
From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo&#39;s submarine, and ran along Stínadly in the dark alleys.
In the end, behind all the branching of the authors and their message, it reads: &quot;The bright sun of the worlds of other Karel Hynek Mácha&quot;.
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader&#39;s opinion?
On the reflection that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, maybe years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with a book in their difficult life decision.
Books are actually &quot;lives&quot; or rather &quot;worlds&quot;.
They are encoded in the characters of the letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of each language.
We can wake them to life at any time by letting their sentences flow into the brain.
It is, in a way, something forbiddenly divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in lines - according to old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the publication of the book - as usual - a chain of author readings awaits you.
I remember you used to enjoy reading.
Will you throw yourself into it again with joy, or do you feel differently after years?
Today I prefer to just tell.
And what did I find out?
Good intelligent people live everywhere.
Their basic feature - they are inconspicuous, they do not draw much attention to themselves, they have a friendly radiance, you do not feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec there was (and I hope he still lives) one curly bookseller (aptly named Červenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl&#39;s bull.
During one drinker, he introduced me to individual articles in the readership of my book Houština.
I looked them in the eye, and then I was shown a torn, read copy of my book.
Embarrassed, I set aside the morning egg I had just read and cried briefly as a man.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and tearing drunkenly with emotion.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn&#39;t stand it and roared headlong from the window into the snowdrift.
It was downstairs.
We ran out into the night landscape and captivated by the happy rabies of the senses, the aching souls of the compatriots and the longing of the lost patriots - they howled and howled like werewolves until the morning.
Each of your books is formally and content-wise different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It&#39;s a story.
It is a fairy tale about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his short story Suchodol, Ivan Bunin puts the words of an old Russian myth into the mouth of a folk healer: At sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There is a dog, a gray chest on it.
Horror, horror, secrets.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe a long time ago we were devils in hell and drew lots - what role we will play on this earth.
Are you going to continue writing, or will you leave it to the free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Březina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the motion of the continents on the planet, affects our desire from such depth and breadth that it completely transcends our horizon - and so we naturally act exactly in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with the influx of dopamine, mixtures of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and gaining new personal territories.
Sometimes a disorder happens and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves people.
That&#39;s the answer to your question - a biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the shores of the ocean unconscious and catching the tides of a gentle wind in a leaky sail made of a dirty handkerchief.
I have to write to be human.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
During English literature classes, it will be necessary to study at least one Shakespeare play, a short story from the 19th century, romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include &quot;hidden text&quot; to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be canceled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a language school-leaving examination and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education should issue a new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
For other key subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees the Matura exams, reveals changes in the structure of the Matura exam, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there was &quot;a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our examination system in order to regain the confidence of society&quot; and that the Matura examination should be made &quot;more demanding&quot;. &quot;more ambitious and stricter&quot;.
The study shows that English schools spend less time on mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
By comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year on mathematics and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official request to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said a comprehensive matriculation examination in mathematics - along with a greater emphasis on the subject in the rankings - is likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on &quot;real world problems&quot;, including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not a cancer in the CSSD
Before the election, a long-simmering dispute between two wings fighting for influence inside the Ostrava CSSD flared up.
It all culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, went to court due to the undemocratic formation of candidates.
The actors of the case, however, did not want to comment too much on this, so as not to harm the party even more before the elections.
But now the votes of the electorate are numbered.
The leadership of the Ostrava CSSD called on the mayor of Ostrava to resign from the party on Monday evening, and will probably push for him to lose his position.
But Petr Kajnar wants to continue fighting.
He described what is at stake in the disputes and who is on whose side in an exclusive interview for Deník.
How do you perceive the result of the election?
The CSSD certainly expected a much better result.
Did it hurt her in our country that disputes within the party were being resolved in the media before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state of the CSSD now.
It is a party that has its internal problems, is internally ill and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
They made it clear in the elections.
What are the internal diseases of the CSSD?
In my opinion, the ODS has been in decline for some time, and similar things are unfortunately now happening in the Social Democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, have moved to the people in the CSSD and have an influence on them.
This is related to the fact that the police walk around the offices of the Ostrava City Hall and collect computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think mainly of their good.
The CSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between the Haškovci and Sobotkovci.
But even that has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a harbinger of what is happening now in Prague.
Hašek&#39;s wing gradually took up positions, so that after the elections it could cause a situation that would weaken Sobotka&#39;s wing.
One is in a situation in politics where one sometimes has to compromise.
But everyone has an inner limit to when compromises can no longer be made, and that is my case.
Originally, I did not want to run for the Chamber of Deputies, but when I perceived the whole thing within the party, I agreed with Luboš Zaorálek that I would try to get a regional candidate to strengthen Sobotka&#39;s wing as the mayor of Ostrava.
But Hašek&#39;s wing gave it a stop.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka, and not Michal Hašek?
In my opinion, Slavek Sobotka is a person who always talks mainly about the CSSD program and, to a certain extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I admit that I haven&#39;t heard anything like that from the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how a bureau that is a lower body than the central executive committee can just begin to dismiss a party chairman.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the statutes of the party.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has now shown in Prague ended his political career.
How did you perceive that the Ostrava leadership of the CSSD did not approve of you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on competition, who will be placed as one of their members.
The competition should be largely based on program visions and the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, people who do not have much ability or vision also enter this competition, but for them a political party is an elevator to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start coming to the fore because they are unscrupulously breaking the rules, breaking the party&#39;s statutes.
Their practices make political parties mafias and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
It is more important for me to draw attention to this issue than to consider whether any Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
Therefore, before the election, you filed a motion with a court for preliminary measures against the form of a CSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the CSSD in Ostrava is consolidating its power by being able to abolish organizations that do not suit it, purposefully establish new organizations, and gradually expel uncomfortable party members.
An example is that they wanted to expel Richard Bednařík from the club of deputies, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and they preferred to repeal the resolution on his expulsion.
This shows that claiming compliance with the party&#39;s statutes through the courts is the last resort, but at the moment when the other methods and control bodies within the CSSD ceased to function, it is the only option.
The effort of the leadership of the Ostrava CSSD, led by MP MP Rykala, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, is interested in this post.
That&#39;s right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, gain votes, and then strengthen their power in the party for those votes.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the Baník Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could call me a man who puts money where it doesn&#39;t belong.
At the same time, the city bought property that is of strategic value to it.
So how do you see it with your remaining in the position of mayor?
The district committee called on me and other people on Monday to consider staying in the CSSD.
But I think it&#39;s like a thief shouting: Catch a thief!
If we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I do not see anyone in the Ostrava Social Democracy who would initiate and enforce, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many developmental issues, such as industrial zones or the expansion of science and technology park.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I read nothing more than to prevent others from breaking into the places they desire.
Will you still fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, then political parties must also function well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to run the state effectively if it cannot run itself.
So I don&#39;t think I&#39;d leave the CSSD now, because I don&#39;t think the one who&#39;s causing this party&#39;s cancer is me, but these people who are trying to upset me.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, Rajtoral promises
It&#39;s kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful in recent times, the defender or midfielder of Viktoria Plzeň, František Rajtoral, has a form that has earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He also succeeds in shooting, he is full of activity, after the intervention he was ordered a penalty kick in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached the victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice, but in the end she took only one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
&quot;I believe that we will beat Jablonec at home,&quot; promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match with the North Bohemians, who play offensive football.
Everything is headed for the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent&#39;s game.
&quot;I believe that it will be a great match on Friday night,&quot; the Czech national team lures fans to the stands of Doosan Arena.
Pilsen&#39;s last matches did not turn out as they would have liked, but defender Viktor refuses the word crisis.
That&#39;s the way it is in football, sometimes you are in good shape and sometimes worse.
But I would by no means talk about the crisis.
&quot;I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again,&quot; says the defender of the West Bohemia.
Viktorie were relying on their ability to support fans.
&quot;It takes place on Friday night and I would like to invite our fans, who are great.&quot;
&quot;I believe we will repay them by winning,&quot; adds Rajtoral.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to both Zeman and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called in open letters to students, educators and high school and university leaders in several regions to defend academic freedoms from the election campaign run by President Miloš Zeman in schools.
I met with more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the honorary chairman of SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received retaliation in the form of not inviting him to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of school representatives who were not so brave and made Miloš Zeman&#39;s visit possible: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Grammar School in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kolín, JE Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.
Now, in Pardubice, we are seeing the continuation of policy enforcement at universities.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, the Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it&#39;s really not the same as staying in the position of mayor of a small town, for example.
Do you want to join the CSSD governors, who simultaneously hold the position of deputy and governor and, like them, degrade both professions?
This tells people that you can handle both of these demanding left-back functions.
I know, we have the example of Michal Hašek, who even handles several dozen functions at once.
But that&#39;s probably not an example of a person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánka Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary position so that she could fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the position of Dean is that by concurrently functions you will violate the apolitical nature of the academic grounds of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current work in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help &quot;your&quot; school without remaining a dean.
I think that your students will have a similar opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen that the voters will calculate it for you in the next election.
And it doesn&#39;t have to last long.
John Kerry admitted: Spying has gone too far!
The United States has sometimes gone &quot;too far&quot; in spying, according to AFP, US Foreign Secretary John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
However, according to the minister, the collection of information served to avert terrorist attacks.
The &quot;first confession from Washington&quot;, according to AFP, was voiced amid fierce controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations about the US National Security Agency&#39;s (NSA) mass surveillance of data, targeting US allies.
&quot;In some cases, I admit, as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future,&quot; Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he mainly defended the current practice.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary for the fight against terrorism and the prevention of assassinations, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the USA, the assassinations in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
&quot;We prevented the planes from crashing, the buildings exploding and the people being killed because we were able to be informed in time of the allegations,&quot; Kerry said.
However, he reiterated that the collection of information &quot;went a long way in some cases&quot;.
The US intelligence affair, which reportedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were watching the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their outrage, and some called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly reduce surveillance.
The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Association of Young Men (YMCA) had been charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on the Sexual Exploitation of Children learned that before charges were brought against the child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Young Men&#39;s Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with child sexual abuse.
But the commission said that in its introductory statement to the commission, the association said they had never dealt with a child&#39;s sexual abuse case in their organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offenses and another in which a YMCA Caringbah gymnast was convicted in 1991 of sexually harassing children in his care. .
Mr Hare told Gail Furness, the commission&#39;s adviser, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA&#39;s introductory statement was also inaccurate, stating that external audits were being carried out at the YMCA that recognized the organization as a leading advocate for children&#39;s rights.
The evidence presented by the commission indicates that the YMCA was alerted to the fact that it received the second lowest of the four possible evaluations in an audit of the Ministry of Education and Society in August this year.
Mr Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the leadership from him himself had failed to accept Mr Lord, without making sure that staff were aware of the obligation to report breaches of child safety.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually harassing 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
However, Mr Hare rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a breach of child safety by Mr. Lord.
Staff members provided evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that the Lord was alone with the children, guarding them privately, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his mobile phone. by phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was the Lord&#39;s subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, Head of Child Services at the Lord&#39;s YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord&#39;s superior, was &quot;very intimidating and often hard to talk to him about anything &quot;.
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt uncomfortable if they had to contact their superiors and report the deeds.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord obscured their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had given his opinion to the YMCA Council in New South Wales that the lesson from the &quot;Jonathan Lord case&quot; for the organization was that the staff had &quot;not reported&quot; and the board agreed.
Mr Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations arose was made by Liam Whitley, YMCA&#39;s general manager for children&#39;s services.
He said the aim was to avoid distorting the evidence, but it was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly executed.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a child-safe organization between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems with recruitment, screening, induction, training and personnel management.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in the Construction Industry in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: The new green for savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been struggling with a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the state&#39;s lack of interest in resolving the issue of capital construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who will save significant amounts for heating after the implementation of the measure, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 new jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the state&#39;s fiscal policy, leverage and multiplier effects are significant; it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Entrepreneurs in the Construction Industry in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government&#39;s resolution and calls for the implementation of such steps that would enable the further continuation of the program so that further calls can be announced within its framework.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technology advances on airplanes (but not call from their cell phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices &quot;gate to gate&quot; - in addition to calling from their mobile phones - to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music under the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday. ).
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Airlines will need to demonstrate to the FAA Administration to the extent that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated flight crew training manuals and stowage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already handed over the plans.
&quot;Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,&quot; the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They cannot turn them on until the aircraft reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft descends to land and do not turn them on until the aircraft is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their equipment during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
&quot;Once the new rules are safely implemented - and we will work closely with transport companies - it will be a success,&quot; Glading said in a statement.
Honestly, we are tired of looking like &quot;watchdogs&quot;.
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and sms or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when, as is well known, he was thrown off an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored for fear that they could injure someone if they flew around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be prohibited on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transportation Safety, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones continue to be considered a risk.
&quot;Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference to broadcast towers in the air,&quot; said Rosenker.
A sectoral advisory committee set up by the FAA administration to investigate the issue last month suggested that the government allow the wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, argue that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to switch off their facilities.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical achievement of the time.
New airlines are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous-generation aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Today&#39;s electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio transmissions than previous generations.
For example, e-readers emit only minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmission is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those pushing for restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the airliner with their Kindle electronic readers and performed a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee have expressed mixed feelings about whether these facilities pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believed the interference from these facilities was real, even when the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there were only sketchy reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices could cause disruption to aircraft systems, and most of these reports were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to instruct passengers to turn off equipment while flying under low-visibility instruments.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and said it was a sensible practice for the traveling public to make extensive use of technology.
&quot;We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with safety,&quot; said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said American espionage had &quot;gone too far&quot;
John Kerry indicated a refinement of the US defense position on its surveillance programs and said in an unprecedented confession that in some cases espionage had &quot;gone too far&quot;.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama are responsible for acting as an &quot;autopilot&quot; in light of the annoying revelations about NSA espionage by the informant Edward Snowden.
The published information caused a diplomatic storm between the US government and its allies.
Mr Kerry said in a video link at an open government conference in London: &quot;There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government have indeed learned about some of the things that have happened from inertia, because the possibility was there, with reference. to World War II, a difficult period of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11. &quot;
He thus became the first high-ranking member of the US government to admit that American espionage had crossed the line, but stressed that no one&#39;s rights had been violated.
He said, &quot;In some cases, it has gone too far.&quot;
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people, and he is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not being abused in this process.
However, Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA was working for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: &quot;We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.&quot;
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to catch and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being executed, because we can already find out about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday that US lawmakers were going to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged US espionage and persuade Europeans that they should continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was worried about their threats to stop participating in counterterrorism organizations because they were disappointed by the National Security Agency&#39;s (NSA) surveillance.
It is indeed important for the national security interests of the United States that Europe remain on the same ship with us, given the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs .
And I&#39;m heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite their anger at NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA collected millions of telephone records in Europe disrupted relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States.
Further revelations cited documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was monitoring the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended Allied espionage as necessary, saying it was commonplace on both sides.
Amid the turmoil, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year and hoped that members of both parties and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators who intend to participate will be published.
He said the program was still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the goal was to help rebuild relationships, he said &quot;well-meaning educational measures&quot; would be in place.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they have used for years.
&quot;While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also be aware that we are not the only ones spying here,&quot; Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to the hostility sparked by US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance.
There is no threat of imprisonment for the words &quot;Mugabe is a lame donkey&quot;, the court repealed the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to how they talk in public about the 80-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and has been at the helm since late 1987.
Under section 33 of the Criminal Code, a $ 100 fine for up to one year in prison could be fined for insulting the presidency.
&quot;Prosecutors should not zealously accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places,&quot; the Constitutional Court officials said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law was undermining freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court&#39;s decision, the British BBC informed.
A number of injured Zimbabweans were loudly opposed to the law, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president during an argument with a police officer at a bar.
In May, an opposition activist who publicized Mugabe&#39;s curse &quot;lame ass&quot; ended up in prison.
In August, the prosecutor then accused the 26-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with Robert Mugabe&#39;s face as toilet paper.
The court also declared it unconstitutional to restrict media freedom.
&quot;The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be untrue,&quot; said Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
&quot;The existence of a law allowing criminalization of someone for making a false statement has a freezing effect on the right to express oneself freely,&quot; Malala added.
Despite Mugabe&#39;s rule with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in a referendum in March.
The country took small steps away from the one-man dictatorship in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraj into the prime minister&#39;s chair.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and, until 2008, the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, therefore, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe only pays in the currencies of other countries.
The impoverished economy is due to Mugabe&#39;s reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
However, most of them had no experience with running farms.
A young couple has matured to live with their parents, the new house offers privacy to both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the task of designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, while the plot itself slopes somewhat.
The request also stated that there would be two generations living in the house who would like to live together, but at the same time each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
The architects therefore decided to place each household on one of the floors of the house.
&quot;When creating the design, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place.&quot;
&quot;The three different functions of the house are connected in several ways through the exterior of the building, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their privacy,&quot; the designers explain.
The parents&#39; household is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, as they differ in the different finishing of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was shaped using plank panels, the part where the office is is plastered in white and the remaining elements remain in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very closely connected with the exterior.
The parents&#39; household, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance for the family.
The connection between the interior and the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there climbs the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to cascade through them.
This is what the architects tried to differentiate the house from others and imprint something unique on it.
The household of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of Tokyo Bay.
The office on the top floor itself is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and from there climbs the stairs up.
Firefighters came to rescue a lost puppy who was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was trapped in a quarry by a man walking his dog.
Firefighters descended the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was released by fire brigades, who came to free him after somehow trapped himself on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days alone until he was rescued from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappit Quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After running away when he got into a small accident, they frantically searched for their lost dog and posted calls on social networks.
On Wednesday at about 2.15 pm, a clairvoyant dogmaker saw Ruby stuck on a protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station hurried to the scene and descended to free Ruby, using an animal carrying bag to pick him up on the rock.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue team commander, said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of a rock wall - 15 meters from the top and bottom.
He did not raise an eyebrow during the rescue - he was totally frozen.
But now she&#39;s fine.
He then received cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is unbelievable.
The technical commander of the technical rescue team, Peter Lau, said: &quot;Ruby was very lucky during his escape.&quot;
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to a vet for a checkup, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire said, &quot;I was scared looking at the rescue operation.&quot;
Above all, I couldn&#39;t believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in his arms again.
The vet said that if he became too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, &quot;We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there.&quot;
The firefighters were great.
We just still don&#39;t understand how he got there.
A cooling tower burned down at night in the ČKD industrial area in Prague
A large-capacity storage tank was burning in the ČKD industrial area in Prague, according to firefighters, probably a cooling tower.
&quot;Firefighters went to the fire on Thursday before eleven o&#39;clock in the evening, this morning they were still extinguishing the fire,&quot; said Pavlína Adamcová, a spokeswoman for the Prague fire brigade.
According to measurements, the amount of pollutants in the surrounding air did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the causes of the fire are still unknown.
About fifty firefighters gradually arrived at the complex in Kolbenova Street.
&quot;This is a fire in a large-capacity tank, probably a cooling tower,&quot; Adamcova said.
&quot;There is no functional hydrant network in the complex, so we extinguish it by means of a transport line from the tanks,&quot; she added.
According to the tn.cz server, firefighting was complicated by a malfunctioning hydrant network, so firefighters had to transport water from elsewhere.
The commander of the fire brigade announced the second stage of the fire alarm.
There are a total of four levels, in the most serious situations the fourth is announced.
Chemists also went to the scene to check the level of hazardous substances that could get into the air during a fire.
&quot;However, they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed hygienic standards,&quot; said a spokeswoman for the fire brigade.
A $ 325 million rescue package for Tasmanian healthcare
The federal government insists that the $ 325 million rescue package for the moribund health care in Tasmania include harsh conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste money.
Federal Health Secretary Tanya Plibersek said the Australian Union was taking &quot;fast track action&quot; to avert a crisis caused by the island&#39;s aging population, more chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultations with Andrew Taski, an independent Tasmanian MP.
&quot;The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,&quot; Ms Plibersek said today.
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million for patient-requested surgery.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help eliminate debt.
The money is also available at open clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training for health professionals, mental health services and the launch of personal electronic health record systems at local hospitals.
&quot;These investments respond to ideas that leading clinicians have told me are the best way to help the Tasmanian healthcare system,&quot; Ms. Plibersek said.
The minister emphasized that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting and registration regime.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the Australian Federation&#39;s money and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $ 325 million would be useless &quot;until a genuine reform followed to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system.&quot;
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he made for the first time in talks with the Prime Minister in early May.
&quot;I believe the federal aid package can free public health from a critical state,&quot; Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional elected procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Federal health opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today&#39;s statement is just a &quot;patch.&quot;
&quot;The reason I&#39;m here is because the Labor government has taken $ 430 million out of our health care system,&quot; he told ABC TV.
You can&#39;t have a state government that takes almost half a billion dollars and an Australian union that donates $ 300 million and pretend to be good news.
Mr Dutton called on Mrs Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar in the rescue package was spent on more bureaucracy.
Music plays in the metro on Můstek
Dopravní podnik hl. m. (DPP) of Prague launched the project Music in the metro.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music is played continuously during the operation of the metro, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The trial run will last six months.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghettos to ease tensions
In the future, police specialists should work in ghettos in the Czech Republic.
They would spend up to half of their errands here.
They would oversee order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should help reduce tensions between people from poor places and people from the surrounding area.
The Ministry of the Interior counts on this in its proposal to reduce security risks.
According to him, &quot;accelerated provision of social housing&quot; would help to improve the situation in the country.
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 slums and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
80,000 people lived in them, mainly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, and children ended up in &quot;special&quot; schools.
Bujela usury.
According to experts of problem localities, there has been a hundred more in the meantime.
Relations between their inhabitants and others are intensifying.
Anti-Roma marches took place in several places.
People from the surrounding area also joined the extremists.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
The fundamental condition is said to be &quot;the consistent application of equal treatment in law enforcement&quot;.
But it is said that it is not possible to achieve this without detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
The specialist would go on errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
He would oversee order in a troubled location.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or offenses.
&quot;Thanks to the established trust, specialists will be easier able to prevent a number of infringements,&quot; the interior said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive surcharges, namely 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers into problem areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czechia pays 15 percent of the amount, funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, and a detailed proposal is now being prepared.
The project is to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
&quot;There are so-called Roma settlements,&quot; the authors of the report said.
It is not yet clear how many specialists there should be in the Czech Republic.
The answer is to give an analysis that identifies places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the end of the project.
According to the project proposal, the first selected police officers complete an internship in Slovakia.
Fifty members should undergo this training every year.
The most suitable candidates will emerge from them.
Special training should also be provided for police officers working in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should supposed motivate and lead to integration.
According to the ideas of the interior, it would have three categories.
Hostels with well-defined rules, such as the number of people per room, would meet the minimum standard.
The medium standard would be in smaller apartments.
Social housing, which would be comparable to ordinary housing, would have a higher standard.
Tenants would have to comply with an integration plan drawn up with them by social workers.
They would have to follow the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send children to school, retrain and actively look for work.
If they sought inclusion, they would advance to a higher standard of living.
According to the interior, the system of permeable housing should work for at least 30 years until the next generation grows up &quot;in a pro-integration-motivated environment&quot;.
The model of social housing is being prepared by ministries for local development and work.
They have to design it by the end of the year.
Together with Bárta, the inspection also arrested an anti-corruption police analyst
Information about Vít Bárta&#39;s arrest began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was brought by the Prvnízpravy.cz server.
MF DNES soon found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS), its people were to arrest Bárta in the center of Prague.
It took place in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspectorate deals with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its authority also extends to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the arrested is one of the anti-corruption police officers - Jan Petržílek, head of analyst and informatics.
He previously worked for the Security Information Service.
However, the spokesman of the anti-corruption police, Jaroslav Ibehej, declined to comment on the information, adding that the media must turn to the GIBS in this matter.
However, its spokeswoman for the inspection, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, but immediately referred to the Municipal Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office in Prague.
&quot;With regard to the protection of classified information, we will not comment on this question in any way,&quot; said Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the council.
It can also be deduced from this vague reaction that the event took place, but is in a state of secrecy, which does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
Bárta&#39;s lawyer Oldřich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Bárta &quot;even in this matter&quot;, but given that it was classified information, he could not confirm or refute Bárta&#39;s arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bart&#39;s arrest might be related to former police president Petr Lessy.
This was promoted to the position of Bárta together with the former chairman of VV Radek John, who sat at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute, which caused outrage between Prime Minister Petr Nečas and VV, even had to be resolved by the then President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from for me.
No one contacted me, I was not questioned.
&quot;I really don&#39;t know anything about the thing,&quot; Lessy said to iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Although officially enforced by Radek John, the real leader of the party was Bárta at the time.
Bárta was now running in the elections for the Dawn movement, narrowly escaping his parliamentary mandate - by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what it was.
&quot;Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidate and, as I repeatedly said before the election, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tomio Okamura,&quot; he distanced himself from Bárta Okamura, who said before the election he gave Bárta room to run for Dawn because it helped him solve the problem of executors.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former fellow VV Jaroslav Škárka.
Foreign workers with a visa authorization may take an &quot;eligibility&quot; test
As the government intends to expand police action, it is considering a &quot;eligibility&quot; test for foreign workers with a visa license 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government debate article was published today, former Labor MP Maxine McKew condemned the government&#39;s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia&#39;s neighbors.
&quot;The loud statements &#39;foreigners at the end of the line&#39; and &#39;work first for Australians&#39; are a very unpleasant remnant of a time when unions demanded a sheltered labor market,&quot; she told the Australian-Indian Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the white workforce was to be protected - and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if anyone in this region echoed this historic artifact.
The discussion paper discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Secretary Brendan O&#39;Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to deal with officials over human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
If the &quot;eligibility&quot; criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether &quot;the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal relationship with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking.&quot;
After previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of them, companies may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum died of a suspected heart attack after arriving in an asylum boat in the Christmas islands this week.
The man&#39;s nine-year-old frightened son traveled to Australia with him, and after the death of his father on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the ship.
Australian authorities and the man hurried to a hospital in the Christmas islands, where he died.
Israeli military planes attacked a target in Syria, the official said
Israeli military planes hit a target in the Syrian port of Laziki on Thursday night, a government official told Fox News.
This official did not specifically say what the goal was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice before this year, Israel carried out an air strike on missile supplies in Syria.
She moved from the villa to a block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful residential areas in Prague in Ořechovka.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance pay.
Therefore, Ivana quickly looked for alternative housing for herself and her then older mother.
He received a tip from acquaintances for a 3 + kk apartment in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
&quot;At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the large forest park and the dam on the other hand thrilled me,&quot; Ivana recalls of the first impression.
At first I thought it would be temporary for three years.
&quot;Today we have lived here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction I would not change,&quot; adds the owner.
The mother and daughter then moved from a 100-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and distributed almost all the equipment.
The event was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but the necessary adjustments had to be made, such as painting the doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner demolished the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hall, and vice versa, a small bathroom.
The connection of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to define the individual zones and divide the room, which allowed for a new placement of lights.
The first step she took after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained in air and opened up a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step in partially improving the standard was to replace the PVC floor with a laminate floor.
Ivana couldn&#39;t handle the bathroom.
For years, I subscribed to housing magazines and looked for inspiration.
I recently discovered an interesting realization in one of them.
So on a recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
&quot;It was actually the most important step in the future,&quot; says Ivana.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the layout of the hall.
The architect combined the toilet and bathroom space and replaced the two doors with opening wings with one sliding one, thus saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also barrier-free.
Quality tiles imitate sandstone, there is also a comfortable seat in the shower, and a bidet shower at the toilet.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Douděrová continued.
As part of the show How to Build a Dream, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin Čeněk also took part.
We had to get three functions into the space, which was created by connecting two smaller rooms, dining, living and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, such as half-partitions or Japanese walls.
&quot;As a result, it would violate the openness and unity of space,&quot; explains the architect.
We managed to separate the sleeping and living areas in an original way.
It was enough to turn two sofas back to each other and place a custom-made duvet box between them.
The dining area is defined by shades of the floor and paintings.
The architect used high-quality marmoleum for the floor in the kitchen and dining area, and revived the sliding door with patterned wallpaper.
If necessary, the kitchenette is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor made of anti-allergic marmole has a number of advantages over the previous one made of laminate: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted in color is an example of how you can work with space in a block of flats.
I left the colors to the architects, I wished it was joyful.
&quot;I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment,&quot; says Ivana.
Grapeglass tiling with a motif of blooming magnolia is practical and creates a strong aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, we managed to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast between the new and the older works perfectly, for example with the decades-old crystal chandelier and high-quality art objects that Ivana has been collecting all her life.
The kitchen came last.
The lockers had previously been placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect took their numbers and rearranged their deployment.
The furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface is softened by a slightly pearlescent surface.
Thanks to the imaginative solution, a washing machine, dryer and dishwasher fit into the small space.
The appearance of the small kitchen was enlivened by the all-glass wall cladding above the worktop.
The unique grapeglass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, and it is also well maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers that remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she had lived for years.
Now she seems happy here too.
The original bathroom had a small bath and sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiles.
The large shower has a Ronal glass door.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from the given environment, in which the functions and devices will be in harmony.
We unified the interior in terms of material and color and tried to give it an elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
&quot;Another condition for the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the accessibility of daily necessities,&quot; adds Kamila Douděrová.
Minister Holcát renewed the position of Head Nurse for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
&quot;I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalized, so that nurses have a representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary,&quot; explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves to be given due attention by the ministry.
In the exercise of this profession, not only high professionalism is required, but also a human approach and personal convictions.
&quot;I will be happy and very responsible in my efforts to promote steps that can improve the position of nurses.&quot;
&quot;We have excellent and skilful nurses in our healthcare system, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who, with their approach to patients, do not help us much to carry out their profession with all empathy and help us improve the image of nurses in the public eye,&quot; says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Head Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also stated on the occasion of her inauguration that she wants to deal with various aspects of the nurse&#39;s job position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
&quot;I don&#39;t want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing side by side, each with their own competencies and, together with other healthcare professionals, forming a well-coordinated work team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient.&quot;
&quot;I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in solving them.&quot;
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
&quot;I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks are unnecessarily burdensome for nurses and deprive them of time that they could and should prefer to devote to patients,&quot; says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas it intends to focus on are improving working conditions, finding ways to work better together with the team and with the management of health care providers, adjusting competencies as well as labor law issues such as compliance with the Labor Code or not overburdening nurses with insufficient numbers at a given time. and place.
We often hear anonymous applause, but out of fear of possible punishment, they are not documented in a specific case where a violation of the rules could occur.
&quot;Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, so in this case the position of the Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and have the specific case examined by the competent authorities,&quot; concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been working as the head of the department of nursing and other non-medical fields and recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a bedside nurse in the internal medicine department, and also worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, and has been lecturing in nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted Denis Diderot&#39;s short story, which brings an exceptional film set and rendition of the time, but is also more boring than it should be.
It takes place in the 1960s in France and tells a gloomy story about Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a convent by her family.
When he rebels, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from a reprehensibly perverted mother introduced and for others he becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips to lust or sensationalism, and that&#39;s his problem.
The ceremonial nature of this story leads to the fact that even viewers will experience the torment similar to wearing a horsehair shirt.
Jana Péťová: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it like that, it&#39;s not really a step at all, but a big leap - a jump a few years back, to memories, to my childhood.
It&#39;s a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come home from school and wash the dishes, luxuriate and do your homework.
Although these &quot;duties&quot; were mostly just theories, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - running out of school, throwing a bag in the corner and running outside.
Play ball games with other kids, jump a shot.
Then, during the series, Helena and her boys embroider with a chain stitch a festive tablecloth for Grandma&#39;s birthday.
And only after several warnings to finally wash the dishes, luxuriate, apply wood to the tiled stove in the winter and do homework after dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and write love verses addressed to school love instead of homework).
In the morning, have homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the jams that are sold now, the contents of which did not even lie next to the strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which Mom and I loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings, when there was a grave silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on tapes that were being played loudly in an old cassette tape after my mother.
And then we rewound the tapes on the pencil and played the same song over and over, our favorite one, and sipped it with a siphon.
Or we used to make phone calls across the table using cans that were tied together with a string - and when we were at the phone call, we had to thoroughly clean our ears to hear ourselves better, the ear of which was then a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live from it in such a way that we lacked nothing.
We didn&#39;t need any iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best &quot;addition&quot; to the wardrobe was a batik home-made T-shirt with the help of SAVA.
From the electronics, our mother&#39;s cassette player and the Walkman, which we shared with my sister and which we used only on the train on a school trip, were enough to satisfy us.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Kloboučka Hop or Man, don&#39;t be angry, or as I said, go &quot;just&quot; out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, my parents certainly saved a long time for it, but unfortunately it didn&#39;t warm up for a long time.
My younger sister stuffed a strudel into him, he said he wrote the tapes so beautifully, so she tried to see if the strudel also sleeps.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, to this day, poor thing, he still has this incident on his dad&#39;s plate.
She says that when Lenka was little, she used to strike a strudel into a video and thought that she would be played by a recipe and not played, so she still can&#39;t bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate with each other, to talk without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I arranged with the grandmother&#39;s granddaughter during the holidays with the grandmother, when we would meet again next summer with the grandmothers - and that was how it was.
We met.
Promise yourself now with someone that you will see each other in a year ?!
I also remember the winter, when the whole village and I ran outside, built snowmen, rode on a snowy hill near the church on bags stuffed with hay.
Then the whole family and I had dinner and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I heard the notorious phrase before each dinner: &quot;Go wash your hands!&quot;
Yes, this is still true today, but you certainly don&#39;t have soap tied to the tap in the bathroom in a lemon net.
After dinner, when Dad was &quot;working&quot; on the beer with Jarda from the village in the garage, Mom and I lay down on the floor, leaning our feet against the tiled stove, opening the door and looking at the flame, listening to the crackling of wood pouring from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn&#39;t count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn&#39;t write messages through various chats, text messages every day.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew far more about ourselves.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It&#39;s nice to remember, especially if I complement these memories by looking at albums where black-and-white photos are neatly glued with black corners.
And if I don&#39;t happen to know how old I was then, the year the picture was taken is always written on the back of the photo.
I look at the fact that although the cuts according to the pot didn&#39;t suit us very well and we also had two cousins&#39; pants bigger than our cousin, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I&#39;d rather go back one step - to reality.
Until 2013 and I will wait for what modern times will come up with, for example, once for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now at least somewhere &quot;a hundred years behind monkeys&quot; for the young teenage generation, and I think they are losing a lot that they will not experience this &quot;pre-monkey&quot; time either.
I wish them!
They have to save, young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea what the interest rates are
More and more Czechs are setting aside money.
Nevertheless, they do not reach the champions in savings in the region.
The most money is saved by Austrians, who save an average of 181 euros a month.
People in Slovakia also save a little more than Czechs.
This emerges from a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving and two thirds of respondents plan to set aside more money.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the list of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little savings products.
For example, almost every second Serb saves at home &quot;under the pillow&quot;, according to the survey.
In the Czech Republic, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased this year.
Last year, 26 percent of respondents spent a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns on various types of savings every month, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly deposit fell slightly to 2,078 crowns year-on-year.
The biggest hit among savings products is supplementary pension insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining; compared to last year, interest in investment funds has also fallen sharply.
Only 16 percent of respondents use them, while last year it was almost a quarter of people.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns they achieve on individual products.
Especially young people under 30 do not know how much their money is paid.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents is best aware of the profitability of their money, 73 percent of people over the age of 50 know this.
In an international comparison of the Erste Group, Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians 12% apart.
The Australian appealed against her stay in a Thai prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket for falsely claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged with wrongful charges by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 when she told Thai police that a taxi driver and two other men who allegedly detained her attacked her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, a CCTV recording later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police conducted interviews with Bamford for two days before confessing to making up the incident.
She was held in a local police cell before the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in an adult women&#39;s prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help with his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had &quot;extreme concerns&quot; about their daughter&#39;s fate and wanted her back in Australia.
&quot;Obviously this is a difficult time, but we hope that he will return to us safely as soon as possible,&quot; Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia state that in the meantime she spent her holidays in the Krabi recreation area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to legal proceedings that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in an adult prison.
However, following the recent assassination of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to correct a battered picture for tourists, which may have been behind the liberating verdict.
Michal Horáček presented his new double album, band and three singers
The lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Kolín Municipal Social House not only his completely new double CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the show Between Us by singers Lenka Nová, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml, accompanied by the excellent Matěj Benko Orchestra.
After the introductory intro and the acting etude about the delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of how they last played in Cologne and in the theater, and the electricity went out throughout the city.
&quot;Otherwise, they produced two types of cards in Cologne, with which I came into contact a lot,&quot; he recalled.
He also reminded us of a native of President Zeman.
&quot;Perhaps we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka near Bratislava,&quot; he joked about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horáček, who did not leave the stage and, if he did not speak, sitting at a table with a glass of wine, touched on his new musical achievement.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, but at the time he had no idea how we meet in the squares and chant who is not jumping is not Czech.
That&#39;s the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won&#39;t play it here today, &quot;he amused.
However, Ondra Ruml sang from this record for him, which is said to be very suitable for him to sleep during the day, sing at night and accompany him on guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn&#39;t sing, he played percussion, and all three singers were accompanied by a band consisting of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang a bit of the scorer together. They sit down on the side of the heart, which immediately stirred up the auditorium.
&quot;I&#39;m glad you were interested in the song, which didn&#39;t surprise me in Kmoch&#39;s city,&quot; Michal Horáček then responded.
After the memory of Petr Hapka, I recognize František Segrad, I was rewarded with great applause by Richard Müller, Hana Hegerová was reminded again by the song Dad liked Lida Baarová and Horáček&#39;s explanation of the communist ban and Baar&#39;s replacement by the American actress Mae West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was again reminded by the composition Sebastián, Segrado then sang a beautiful composition in Prague set to music by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zámmec and a former Kolíňák.
But that was the conclusion, the standing ovation and the addition in the form of the optimistic composition We Live in a Wonderful Time.
There was one more addition to the playlist, but the fans didn&#39;t applaud it anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, the quartet sat at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also older CDs, Michal Horáček their books and even the cover of the legendary LP, and took pictures with any interested parties.
Recently, the CEO of ČEZ announced that he was postponing the decision on the construction of Units 3 and 4 of the Temelín power plant to the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and the approval of the Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - ie for the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should make recommendations to shareholders, not hide behind them.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over a parental leave program
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over a parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit.
The mining mogul, who is in dispute over the payment of a $ 6 million coal tax assessment, made the allegation as he tried to sweep the question of whether there was a conflict of interest.
Palmer&#39;s United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can play a vital role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott&#39;s daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
&quot;He got into a big conflict of interest when it came to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in getting parental leave,&quot; Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the election commission officially declared Mr Palmer the winner of the Fairfax seat in the Sunshine Coast by 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results in order to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the polls closed?
&quot;We need to have a better system,&quot; he said.
Why can&#39;t we have a system where you can come, tap details into a computer, vote immediately and have results at half past six in the evening?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is that results can be erased if someone doesn&#39;t like them?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution with New Zealand to the debate.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political agenda also extended to Sunshine Coast airports and that he would take his new job &quot;very seriously&quot;.
Public office is a service to the public.
&quot;We are not seeking any reward other than being able to serve society at this critical time,&quot; he said.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the approaching effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of company representatives surveyed said they had not addressed issues related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This follows from a survey by the law firm Ambruz &amp; Dark Deloitte Legal, which sought the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In connection with the approaching date of effectiveness of both key codes, it is only now at the last minute that many managers are beginning to realize how significant they can have an impact on the business of their companies.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Due to politics, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether or not revolutionary change will eventually take place.
&quot;Now, however, they only have a few weeks left for the transition to the new law to take place for their companies without complications,&quot; commented Ambruz &amp; Dark Deloitte Legal partner Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively involved in the new codes, 26 percent said that their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be ready in time.
In addition, 35 percent of companies of this number are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the other hand, one in five companies has not yet dealt with recodifications, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent do not have an opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies admit that they have not yet addressed issues related to recodification.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts for the largest number of companies surveyed (21 percent), followed by the resolution of business conditions (16 percent) and changes in the real estate cadastre and liability (10 percent).
In the case of contracts, one of the most significant innovations of the entire recodification will take place, namely the unification of the regulation of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will expire, as a result of which contract law should become clearer for citizens and entrepreneurs.
&quot;In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many innovations with an emphasis on greater freedom in organizing relationships,&quot; said Lukáš Poddaný, Ambruz &amp; Dark Deloitte Legal&#39;s lawyer.
In connection with the Commercial Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
The following are topics related to changes in the convening and conduct of the General Meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means stricter obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where a company is in danger of going bankrupt or enters it.
&quot;In practice, this means that if members of the boards of directors and company executives do not act with due diligence and avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit gained for the performance of the function only in the last two years,&quot; added Spáčil.
The revelation of the NSA increases the social paranoia of state surveillance
One peaceful day in late August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the US consulate in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the behest of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photos of the roof of the US advance patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claim that the BfV hoped to be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and the event triggered an exchange of views in Berlin between the US and German foreign ministers.
In September, James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, reiterated that the United States was not using its foreign intelligence capabilities &quot;to steal trade secrets from foreign companies for the benefit of US companies, strengthening their international competitiveness or increasing their profits.&quot;
But since Edward Snowden, who became a whistleblower, began unveiling his valuable collection of covert surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading businessmen no longer know if they should believe the director&#39;s words.
Following reports that the US National Security Agency was spying on a Brazilian oil company and gaining access to data held by US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia about state surveillance has reached new dimensions.
The last straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone may have been tapped for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be the target, then leading entrepreneurs are certainly a potential target.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I would say that it is possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
&quot;Germany needs to wake up,&quot; said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released by EY&#39;s consulting service in July, German companies believe that the US now poses as great a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
However, in the entire documentation revealed by Mr Snowden, there is as yet no evidence that the United States passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and said it should seek to reduce its dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German parliament that we should make a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
That&#39;s not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn&#39;t have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the US intelligence agencies uncovered by Snowden is shocking to some companies, who have so far thought China was the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European officials have become more widely aware that data stored in the US falls under its jurisdiction and is therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance business community, about 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after the discovery of the US Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP&#39;s CEOs, says, &quot;We have a new customer question that wasn&#39;t here a year ago - where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in this jurisdiction?&quot;
Many senior German officials argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and that this data must be protected at all costs.
It is no surprise that economic espionage is being carried out.
It always happened.
&quot;It&#39;s been a major issue for many years, and it hasn&#39;t changed significantly during the current debate,&quot; said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF&#39;s agrochemical company.
Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally don&#39;t want to brag about the countermeasures they&#39;ve taken to avoid giving an attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been remembered that taking a free USB memory stick at a trade fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi&#39;s board of directors, says that it has been common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as wiretaps.
The German BfV advises executives to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are fears that SMEs will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their specific areas.
&quot;SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access,&quot; the BfV warned in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington post, the American documents National Intelligence Estimate in February listed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second line of perpetrators involved in hacking activities for economic correspondents, just behind China.
A board member of a German risk-free society concluded that &quot;the French are the worst when it comes to economic espionage.&quot;
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: &quot;The services know very well that all countries, while cooperating in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.&quot;
A new nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Researchers have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before testing on humans, more tests are needed, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
&quot;We firmly hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhaust all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong that it overcomes all current approaches,&quot; he said. Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to make anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies chase all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine hit.
In tests, vaccinated mice supplemented with nicotine continued to function normally.
But unvaccinated mice &quot;calmed down,&quot; the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had entered their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given often enough to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies so that they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines were completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
However, smokers would be much more likely to use it to quit.
&quot;They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this bad habit,&quot; he said.
British researchers said the results were interesting, but pointed out that further research was needed.
Obama&#39;s voter&#39;s desperate cry
I voted for Obama twice - I shared hope for a possible change
He says Obama&#39;s sincere efforts were thwarted by Republican Party obstructions
Obstruction policy cannot excuse the plight of Obama&#39;s health care website or drone attacks
Memoirs of Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard for the second year.
These days I&#39;m reading a very sad book.
I thought of this book that during the gloomy days of my sophomore year at medical school, I would be encouraged and renewed by a pinch of hope.
It&#39;s called &quot;The Audacity to Win&quot; and is a recollection of Barack Obama&#39;s presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finish the patient reviews in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and the speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelming dominance, and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of the moment.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents hid the newspaper they got.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And here I close the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It&#39;s hard to remember these optimistic days - they seem like distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, there have indeed been changes.
It was definitely not anything I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes - from the law on affordable care to the expulsion of our troops from Iraq and the end of the &quot;ask nothing, say nothing&quot; policy after the death of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the party&#39;s obstruction has turned so many efforts to move our nation forward: it is, among other things, immigration reform, the possibility for the public to choose health care and the closure of the Guantánamo base.
But after many situations of defending the Obama administration from colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit as to the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain consent to the wiretapping of foreign leaders or the raids of drones that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain the fact that the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, nor that it persecutes those who expose government misconduct.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process or for limiting public contributions and expenses during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify finding a report that says the White House&#39;s efforts to silence the media are &quot;the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.&quot;
And most recently, they can&#39;t even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don&#39;t know if something like that was to be expected.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government power might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected office is clearly unpredictable, and our public talks will be shaped by opposition political parties and random events such as the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to be largely the result of the administration&#39;s own decision.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unsolved alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that the second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we had once heard about.
Still, going back to 2008 - with Obama&#39;s support falling below 45% this week - through this book is getting harder.
It makes me remember the many promises that have disappeared.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton during the Pennsylvania primaries.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he needed to get back on track and stay true to his mission.
&quot;I want our magic back,&quot; he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr President, and I completely agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Sales and marketing of ŠkoFIN are led by Abrahámek
His competencies include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Luďek Šantora.
Abraham has connected the last 14 years of his professional career with the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, then at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last position was Suzuki Motor Czech, where he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was established in 1992.
Syria has destroyed its funds for the production of chemical weapons, says the oversight body
Syria has destroyed essential chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition equipment, the Global Chemical Weapons Oversight Committee said on Thursday, as fierce conflicts erupted in the north of the country, near one of the places where toxic substances are expected to be stored.
A Syrian activist group also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The notification from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
the deadline set by that organization based in The Hague for Damascus to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons and chemical mixing machinery for the production of toxic gas and the filling of ammunition.
Completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus&#39;s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
The country is estimated to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged in Safira on Thursday, which experts refer to as the headquarters of a chemical weapons factory and a repository, said the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, based in Britain.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of Bashar Assad&#39;s armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Among those killed are also 2,202 government defectors and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This issue has not been updated since.
The conflict has forced some 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad&#39;s troops have been fighting insurgents in Safira for many, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda.
The observatory said on Thursday that losses were on both sides, but did not have specific numbers.
The fighting has underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have to deal with tight deadlines in their mission to rid Syria in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
A statement from the OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, said his team was now &quot;satisfied that it had verified - and monitored the destruction - of Syria&#39;s declared essential production and mixing / filling equipment.&quot;
He added that &quot;no further control activities are currently planned&quot;.
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit the two sites due to safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been &quot;abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items it contained had been moved to two other declared sites that had been checked.&quot;
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed on a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
&quot;I bow to the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission the organization has ever had,&quot; said Ahmet Uzumcu, director of observers, in a commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad&#39;s government are opposed in the civil war, with their security forces full of members of the Alawit sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said that there was a strong explosion inside an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Laziki on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is starting a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
&quot;Today we are witnessing a milestone: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,&quot; Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the whole European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia&#39;s gas to Europe, adds to the riskiness of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are removed &quot;forever&quot;.
As soon as the whole project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is expected to begin construction in other downstream countries later this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Early puberty: Mature earlier
Research has shown that African American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind it
Experts say that an obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of earlier puberty.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children&#39;s health and family issues.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter&#39;s breasts and pubic hair begin to grow at the age of 7 or 8?
At the American Academy of Pediatricians&#39; annual conference in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and set a new standard.
&quot;I&#39;ve spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that it&#39;s usually not a sign of rapid development toward full puberty,&quot; Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Over the last forty years, however, there has been little change in the age at which menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5, compared with 12.75 in 1970.
&quot;When breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years for the first period,&quot; said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of &quot;Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.&quot; : An essential guide to dealing with this common problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
What activates the true onset of puberty is discussed, but if breast growth is accompanied by growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered &quot;prematurely mature.&quot;
In most cases, the process slows down or stops - which pediatricians can closely monitor.
Faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging, which can eventually lead to stunted growth and stunting in adulthood.
Recommendations regarding medications and hormonal treatment depend on the child&#39;s age, rate of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about taking drugs, but acknowledges that &quot;suppressing puberty can alleviate a girl&#39;s behavioral problems and feelings that are different from her peers.&quot;
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to be menstruating.
&quot;They&#39;re worried she might get pregnant, or how she&#39;s going to handle hygiene,&quot; Kaplowitz said.
&quot;It was a shock,&quot; recalls a woman whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and talks about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no coherent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, environmental chemicals, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys - like girls - reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped carry out a study on girls aged 6 to 9, which linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, patterns of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although boys develop facial and pubic hair at an early age, the trend toward full bloom of early puberty is not as clear as that of girls.
Other physicians attending the American Pediatric Association (AAP) conference added additional complexity to this topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
&quot;We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,&quot; said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children&#39;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
&quot;It may mean having to talk to your child sooner than you think,&quot; Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child is likely to respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if it happens prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits them.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamún.
According to ever-expanding reports, Israel destroyed rockets intended for Hezbollah during Wednesday&#39;s raids on two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the local army.
Its program is also to fight Israel, which is not interfering in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of armaments to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday&#39;s Israeli raids on weapons depots in western Syria are still being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by American sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean hit the Syrian missile base Snabar Jabla south of Latakia.
The al-Arabiya intelligence station claims that two warehouses were hit, in which the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria was constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian air force was teaching members of Hezbollah&#39;s armed forces to handle the missiles.
SA-8 are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 80s.
They are located on a movable chassis.
Although relatively primitive, they are easy to hide due to their mobility and small size.
They are equipped with radar, which turns off after the projectile is fired, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakiya is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alavites.
It is a well-guarded area, and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to help protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Alawi members belong.
Now, 15,000 of his fighters are reportedly ready to help recapture Kalamún.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalamún lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country, Homs.
According to al-Arabiya, the battle is a retaliation for a recent opposition attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Brigade by Abu Fadal Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
This year, Hezbollah helped the Syrian army reclaim the city of Kusayr near the Lebanese border.
Many insurgents from Kusayr have just left for Kalamún.
He claims that Maliki has a large share in the resumption of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly due to the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Sobotka is negotiating on behalf of the CSSD.
Social democracy is crumbling, the people&#39;s people and the grandchildren are talking to each other and preparing for a common approach.
If the Social Democrats get lost within a few weeks, they will sit at a negotiating table with perfectly coordinated partners, who will put on the table a ready-made list of requirements, including ministerial posts.
CSSD envoys then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka came across for the first time after four days, when he was on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to take control of the political committee and, most importantly, to force convicted liars to resign.
So far, only he has been the confirmed negotiator for the party, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the board and now to the citizens.
He should not lie, in personal life or in public.
&quot;It was a mistake,&quot; Michal Hašek said after a meeting of the narrowest leadership of the Social Democracy.
He added that he did not cling to the post of first vice-president.
&quot;I will communicate my decision to the ÚVV on November 10,&quot; Hašek said.
The deputy chairman of the CSSD, Zdeněk Škromach, and the head of the parliamentary club, Jeroným Tejc, spoke similarly.
However, he pointed out that he was elected only two days ago.
Both deputies then stated that they would do everything in their power to make the 50-member CSSD club sound with one voice.
Michal Hašek put the crown on the absurd theater with the sentence: &quot;I have been a member of the CSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities.&quot;
That is, another lie live.
Or did he forget that in calling for Sobotka&#39;s resignation and his expulsion from the negotiating team, the August ÚVV decided with 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party&#39;s candidate for prime minister?
However, the head of the CSSD, by convening the ÚVV until next Sunday, made a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the e-mails of 192 members of this body and the media with a pile of all sorts of gossip and rumors, possibly reminding them of the real mistakes of Sobotka&#39;s political career.
Dirty laundry will be washed hard, there will be signs of dark alliances between the barbarian Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotka&#39;s wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
Disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization CSSD are erupting.
The words of the mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka&#39;s ally Petr Kajnar are warning: &quot;I signed Charter 77 so that idiots would not rule the country.&quot;
If the Central Committee had met this weekend, liars would probably have been forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The traitors sprinkle their heads on ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of the CSSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
The UN is celebrating new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is beginning work without delay on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Prior to the UN summit on sustainable development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for &quot;sustainable development goals&quot; to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit overnight that now is the time to &quot;rise above national interests.&quot;
&quot;I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and adopt a process to implement the general objectives of sustainable development - the SDGs,&quot; he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfill the mandate given to me by the Member States and to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Babiš: Government only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to reconcile that his YES movement will not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government for one to emerge.
President YES admitted this in an interview for Právo, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin promised an ecological Olympics, his plan being thwarted by giant secret dumps
Fans of winter sports are already cutting the meter until the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, while others are looking at their preparation with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, although it will not begin until February, is facing another scandal.
The Russians do not seem to be able to fulfill their promise that the preparation and holding of the games will not in the slightest disrupt nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After all, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had the bar set very high, and the Canadian Games made history as the most environmentally friendly.
However, Russian President Vladimir Putin&#39;s commitment to &quot;zero waste&quot; games seems to have long since taken hold.
Last week, AP reporters discovered a giant building material dump in the village of Akhtyr near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulating foam was found by ecologists in August, which they immediately reported.
Russian authorities sludge and landfill disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters got a glimpse of a dump the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, several in the area of such places have emerged, described the British newspaper The Times.
Russian Railways, a state monopoly working on the site, is building a roughly 60-kilometer route between Sochi Airport and a sports resort.
The business, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin&#39;s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways resisted that the landfill had been set up by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštír, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymta River, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
&quot;Water from here will contaminate Soča&#39;s water springs for the next ten to fifteen years,&quot; Vladimir Kimayev of the environmental non-profit organization EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizing committee and the government.
According to the opposition, the most expensive Olympics in history are one large tunnel.
By comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $ 51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics cost $ 43 billion.
Last year&#39;s Games in London cost only 19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not being respected when working on the exhibition of sports grounds and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers stitched his mouth in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many also fear that Russian organizers are struggling with the new law, which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality, during the games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite changes in the United States, in order to ease regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given American companies room to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight as long as the devices remain in &quot;air&quot; mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a lot of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their practices soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
&quot;CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,&quot; he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its on-board wi-fi entertainment system, was in favor of the change, but announced it would comply with the regulatory authority&#39;s decision.
&quot;We would welcome CASA to analyze permission to use electronic devices, because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless in-flight entertainment),&quot; the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will adhere to current regulations for the time being.
&quot;Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not intend to change this any time soon,&quot; he said.
FAA regulations apply to American airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in regulatory developments that may be useful to our passengers, and we will certainly study the FAA&#39;s decision and the reasons behind it.
For US airlines, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
&quot;Once the airline has confirmed its fleet&#39;s tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, at any altitude,&quot; the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under seats or in an overhead storage area during takeoff and descent.
There is nonsense in the film Gravity, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
Fantastic film from the space of Gravity sold cinemas in the Czech Republic some time after its premiere.
According to the Union of Film Distributors, he was seen by almost 150,000 viewers in October and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews rate the image positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
The Lidovky.cz server asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films that I consider to be modern, dream fairy tales.
Excluding the film Gravity, even though it looks like a &quot;physically real&quot; performance.
No, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s bad.
I enjoyed it a lot.
You may notice, for example, Sandra Bullock&#39;s hair, which somehow does not float in a state of weightlessness.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station move in markedly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in a single shot.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of fire in a state of weightlessness.
According to them, spacesuits would not withstand such blows either.
The heroes in Gravity often collide with various objects and suits can withstand everything without much difficulty.
The critique was not spared the plot.
According to some discussants, such a large-scale tragedy in Earth&#39;s orbit is unrealistic.
In addition, he wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair the technique.
People also argue in the forums about the &quot;unrealistic&quot; behavior of ropes.
It is said to act as if it was intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Observatory and Planetarium of the Capital City of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide screen so far, but I can clearly say I was enchanted.
I&#39;m glad it wasn&#39;t a documentary, it was a science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost an obligation) not to adhere to reality consistently.
&quot;More than the discrepancies you mentioned, I was touched by how a space station with a degrading level of technology (most recently Chinese) is shown three times.&quot;
&quot;After all, the Chinese won&#39;t be out until the end of the decade and they&#39;ll probably look better than they&#39;re in the movie.&quot;
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors very successfully try not to violate the laws of physics, so the science-oriented viewer The view of the Earth from space is very realistic, including the thin shell of the atmosphere and the aurora borealis flashing on the polar regions.
Discrepancies will certainly be found on closer examination.
Additionally, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of orbit of various space debris in orbit in some scenes appears to be the opposite of what it should actually be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators adapted to their needs, but I did not notice any fundamental and sky-breaking transgression against logic or natural laws in the film and in comparison with other films of similar focus they depended on the plausibility of the displayed events.
Among the moments that do not make sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a differently inclined orbit than the ISS.
The result is a great difference in speed, and the rescue operation could not, in fact, take place as shown in the film.
Furthermore, at the moment of the separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go when they no longer move towards each other.
Bombardier&#39;s profit fell due to declining supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, due to fewer aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not released any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it provided up-to-date information on whether the aircraft will adhere to an ambitious plan to begin commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, and the question arose as to whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not meet estimates and shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by 8 percent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded from &quot;higher returns&quot; to &quot;sector performance&quot; on Thursday, with the expectation that the stock market will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
&quot;While we mostly expected smaller aircraft deliveries, we were significantly disappointed by the transport profit margin,&quot; Doerksen told clients.
As the trial continues, we hope Bombardier will win new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect market skepticism about this program to increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will make their way to the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, and after a delay of several months, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft is a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of a test flight to be able to verify the company&#39;s claims regarding the low consumption and cost savings of this airliner.
At present, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft were put into commercial use.
Executives also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing according to plan.
&quot;The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,&quot; Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the outage.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to go through the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of five test planes should take off in the coming weeks and the others shortly thereafter.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating a CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan for putting the aircraft into operation and will provide updated information in the coming months.
&quot;This slow pace of flight testing - while in line with Bombardier&#39;s internal plan - is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,&quot; said Doerksen.
From $ 172 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier, Bombardier&#39;s net income fell to $ 147 million, or 8 cents a share, in the third quarter ended September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters&#39; IBES system, analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer stated that, compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier, it had supplied only 45 aircraft during the quarter.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Outstanding orders in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of September 30, which does not change as of December 31.
&quot;The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but low order intake and the overall state of the market disappointed us,&quot; said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aerospace industry fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world&#39;s largest train maker, said revenue in the division rose nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion.
Outstanding orders in transport amounted to 32.6 billion as of September 30, which is a marginal increase compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Executives said new prospects would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google CFO Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $ 4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil&#39;s Embraer SA, Bombardier&#39;s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor, announced a 10 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
Mick Jagger claims that after the then 18-year-old Katy Perry, he definitely didn&#39;t go.
During an interview for an Australian radio show, the pop star said this week that she sang backing vocals for Jagger&#39;s 2004 song &quot;Old habits die hard&quot;.
Perry said she had dinner with the rock veteran when she was 18 and he drove after her.
She added, &quot;It&#39;s been a long time and now he&#39;s very nice to me.&quot;
In a statement Thursday, Jagger&#39;s (70) deputy said he categorically denied ever making Katy Perry&#39;s proposals.
The deputy said, &quot;Maybe he&#39;s confusing him with someone else.&quot;
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert this year.
Her new album &quot;Prism&quot; debuted at number one this week.
The Kenyan press is outraged by the controversial media law
&quot;It&#39;s a scary news, and it&#39;s time to ask what will keep Parliament from simply sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,&quot; the newspaper said, saying the bill was unconstitutional.
&quot;This law is strict and very repressive, and we reject it,&quot; said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the world&#39;s most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media tribunal &quot;will always be biased because it is an extended hand of the government&quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising will damage Kenya&#39;s position in the global economy.
&quot;I hope that the president will hear us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,&quot; he said.
According to the Star daily, the bill effectively gives the government &quot;full control of the media&quot;, and the Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have &quot;dealt a severe blow&quot; and criticizes the bill as &quot;strict.&quot;
The bill comes amid a series of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the September attack by an Islamic gunman in the Westgate Mall.
The Kenyan media turned the anger of the authorities when it broadcast a security camera recording of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack, allegedly looting a luxury goods store.
The police chief responded by having two journalists and a senior media officer summoned for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies may be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of being &quot;de-listed&quot; or denied official journalist accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to seize the offender&#39;s property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, &quot;even one fine is enough to destroy most radio stations.&quot;
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidating effect on what is called the Kenyan &quot;living blogosphere&quot;.
Politicians know that by silencing the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
&quot;You never know what might happen,&quot; Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu wrote, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
&quot;Leaving it to politicians will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and gathering,&quot; he wrote.
Legislators in Kenya have been the subject of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to cancel cuts ordered by the National Wage Agency and to restore their fat salaries to around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, one of the highest in the world.
The London bubble is bursting as a result of the tax on foreign property owners
The Treasury has tentatively quantified the financial income tax, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborn, who introduced a 7% fee in the 2012 budget for real estate transfers for buildings over £ 2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate under society, not as individuals.
The revenue from the transfer fee for housing in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached £ 708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: &quot;Given the increase in real estate transfers for high value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that high value assets are under-taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system.&quot;
He added that &quot;this move could have made some foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London, or that existing owners are reluctant to sell&quot;.
Leading properties - the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in the wealthy band, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in central London continued to grow steadily at 5.6% year on year, but were overshadowed by a thriving &quot;home market&quot; in which, according to a survey by Savills, the South West, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) experienced growth.
Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner&#39;s illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was to perform on Friday at the Hydro town complex.
However, the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner forced her to move the performance.
The group&#39;s announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday&#39;s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: &quot;Following the decision to postpone today&#39;s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November.&quot;
&quot;Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to get out.&quot;
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
