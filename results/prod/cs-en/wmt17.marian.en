Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco store
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't think of who would hurt him, adding, "He's finally started doing well."
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia, the medical examiner's office said.
San Francisco's police department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
The victim's Louis Galicia's brother told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a regular chef in Boston, had recruited his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months earlier.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "swasted and destroyed" by his death.
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss it very much," the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and grief are for Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had first slept in the dormitores, but that "he had finally started to do well."
“He found the apartment, he's been dating a girl,” Louis Galicia said to KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't think of who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to get in touch with his family, he always cooked us a meal, made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be in any argument.
He was a brother who took things as they are.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was the uncut-crash diamond he had illuminated every day," he said.

Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion in vehicle upgrades.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years the state carrier has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernisation of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, with about half of the trains having a new closed toilet system.
However, the amounts for the modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
In the last six years, Czech Railways has invested over CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, with about half of the trains having a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in a reduction in the average age of two years for locomotives and separate units and six years for classic carriages.
A larger share of the investment was given to the carrier in regional transport, where roughly 60 percent of the money was directed, and 40 percent was invested by the company in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
But the upgraded older vehicles are counted as brand new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of ČD's driving vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age of 23 when the upgrades are set to be.
If only the age from the date of manufacture was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic sets made up of wagons and pulled by a locomotive have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways in recent years and are being replaced by motorised or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, locomotives fell from 280 to 223 units, and the number of classic carriages fell from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was particularly disposing of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
From the investments planned for the vehicle fleet by ČD in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 carriages for speeds up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic fast lines.
The contract provides for the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
Authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, unable to get rid of it.
We are utterly helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial office of the online daily Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in South Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where not only is a tourist interesting walk in the treetops, but also an Olympic park.
The highway managers know they're standing off the books there, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of such ads across the country.
According to officials, the guilt is to the guilt of the poor law, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
What is needed is a complex bureaucratic wheel first.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the bureau is too short for it.
Or just move the ad a few yards away and the official process has to start over.
The Road and Motorway Directorate admitted three months ago: an advertising billboard on the ground up against the main road from České Budějovice to Lipno is on our land by the state road.
But even three months were not enough for the officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable design with a giant ad poster.
It was as if no one minded that he was standing just next to the roadway, in a fifty-meter protection zone where nothing could stand for safety.
Road managers say they can't easily cope with the billboard because of the leaky law.
Maybe pick him up and take him away.
"We mustn't afford that," says Road and Motorway Directorate spokesperson Nina Ledvinová, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be preceded by law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which began to be followed in detail by the online daily Aktuálně.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot deal with effectively and quickly.
In southern Bohemia alone, the paper counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules just next to or near the roadway.
So are other counties.
"We have difficulty for companies to take out the signs," confirms the head of the Transport Department of the České Budějovice Regional Authority, Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are addressing such stories.
According to Klása, a leaky law that binds officials is to blame.
First, he has to approach the billboard owner in a difficult way to get the ad out.
But business executives are often elusive or know the trick that Aktuálně.cz has described in the past when it became more interested in the issue: it is enough to move the mobile stand with the advertisement by a few metres, and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising.
That's because the bureau has to pinpoint exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new facility and we have to reach out to the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law won't help.
The change could have been made by a new law that will ban billboards on motorways from September next year and restrict them on Class I roads.
Critics point out that the rules for tackling illegal and readily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities don't get so easy.
Companies can thus continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year from renting illegal areas, and no one can make it.
For example, a billboard attracting the Lipno to belong to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the České Budějovice Municipality is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with it for black-built billboards.
The company faces a 300,000 fine in each proceeding.
These are more advertisements that have been placed in the protection zone of the I. class I road without permission.
The proceedings are not yet completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Transport Department of the České Budějovice Municipality.
The advertisement, which Aktuálně.cz is interested in, while not yet included among these cases, it will most likely be added to them soon.
According to the spokesperson of the RMD Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will be on the table of the county and then probably the municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious firms that can't be contacted.
It does not take up mail and the official headquarters in Žižkov was cancelled more than six years ago.
It is not even clear who is behind it.
In the past, the company's post office went to the South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who became famous for his sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
However, Fischer, whose Euro Billboard rents the areas from the Comerz Billboard and offers them to advertisers, has in the past rejected any connection.
At the same time, this spring, when the RMD began to take an interest in the Lipno advertisement, Fischer had state officials send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his boarding house, where the company is believed to be based.
This address, however, has not been heard from the highway managers to this day either.
Futal fight.
Such silence or opaque changes to settlements are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company a few years ago for two million crowns.
But she changed the name and the IČO and there was nothing to deal with.
The bailiff returned the case, the ads kept standing, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against such firms and their business practices.
It is like fighting windmills, one of the officials admits on condition of anonymity.
The amendment is not yet being addressed by the law in this regard.
Aktuálně.cz spoke to several MPs who were intrigued by the problem.
But they have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for keeping the billboards for the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national but also regional and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions; on the other, they themselves need them for adverts in election campaigns.
I don't take the rather established impression that if something doesn't work, you need to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, the statisticians estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Yet this year's crop is above the average for the past five and a decade.
On the other hand, the rapeseed harvest (by 3.9 per cent) and poppy (2.5 per cent) will be higher.
Cereal harvesting will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tonnes of grain.
This is according to an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and projected a tenth decline from last year.
Last year's cereal harvest, however, was above average.
This year's crop exceeds the average for the past five and ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy will be higher this year.
Rape growers will harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1.256 million tonnes under the roof.
This year's poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The projected decrease in cereal production is due to a 3.7 per cent reduction in the hectare yield to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the crop area.
Farmers have sled three percent fewer fields this year.
The winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, will be up 3.3 percent less this year, according to an estimate.
The farmers planted it in more fields.
But the drop will be hinged by a lower yield of hectare, which will drop to 6.04 tonnes.
The statisticians predict a roughly one-fifth drop in spring barley, which is most commonly used to make beer.
The decrease in crop worth downing is a 15.2 percent reduction in sowing areas, but also a lower hectare yield.
The barley of the winter, on the other hand, is 6.3 percent more.
There will also grow the rye harvest.
The rape crop is estimated by statisticians at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
The area's sowing area has expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the hectare yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's rapeseed crop will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 per cent, while sowing is a third more extensive on the area than it was a decade ago.
In the last four years, there has also been more poppy-sour fields.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
But against the year 2008, when poppy was grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, the fields are half.
Thanks to the expansion of the sowing areas, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It will go up 2.5 percent against last year to 27,423 tonnes.
But the hectare yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police officers charged two men for the knife and machete attack, and the court remanded them into custody.
Police have charged two assailants who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete in the centre of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, they caused a cut and cut injury, which required hospital treatment and further treatment," police spokesperson Marie Štrbáková said.
The two apparent perpetrators were apprehended immediately after the attack by police officers.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to remand them in custody and was granted by the court on Friday.
Both men face between three and ten years in prison.
Officers charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him with somersification and cuts, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which happened at high noon on Tuesday at the Liberty Avenue, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková reported.
A mass scuffle between two families took place in the area of the garden in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a machete.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, they caused a cut and cut injury that required hospital treatment and other treatment, a police spokesperson said.
The scuffle, which attracted a lot of attention in the city centre, and for which several police patrols and officers had to intervene at the scene, it was a family feud.
Forensics charged a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted grievous bodily harm and disorderly conduct.
The prosecutor filed a motion with the court to take them into custody and the court granted it on Friday, the spokesperson added.
The mashin was also used in the centre of Olomouc in a mass brace by the attackers five years ago, it happened then only a few tens of meters further, in front of the disco Malovac in Riegrova Street.
Officers said at the time that a group of around ten foreigners with guns attacked the guests of the establishment who were standing in front of the entrance.
Police said they had knives, sticks and machete in their hands.
The court then sentenced the two attacking foreigners to a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, you may walk around them every day.
One of the most glaring examples of an unused and empty house is the sprawling building of the former IPB headquarters in the Middle of Senovážná Square.
It should have operated as a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That you need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about the use of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square there are several apartment buildings, which, despite their location, size and often monument protection, are only frennail and empty.
We chose properties in the centre using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or a state that does not know how to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

Mr. to the Clinton, he made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to release his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than $1 million was donated to the Clintons for charity.
Most of the Clintons' income - over $6 million - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
The US Democrat presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, released her tax statements on Friday, increasing the pressure on her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, ex-President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of the Clintons' income - over $6 million - is for their speeches, largely from before April 2015, when Clinton started her election campaign.
The tax report showed that Mr and Mrs. and Mr. and Mr. and Mr. Clinton paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, and a nine percent income tax at the state and local level.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar move, and has not yet committed to the release of his tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump pays no tax at all, Clinton tweeted a few minutes after the release of her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrecy over Trump's income, among other things to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims, the AP reported.
Trump's fortune is estimated to be worth billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican nominee's reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for the post of vice president in tandem with the former First Lady, today released a report on his tax collections for the past decade.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity, and paid 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes last year.
In Nigeria, polio broke out again.
Boko Haram Islamists defended a rigorous vaccination and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of polio have re-releases.
In the northeast of the country, the government has announced an extraordinary vaccination there, as two children infected with the disease have paralyzed the disease.
The vaccines were flown by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were active, defending the vaccination and even killing the doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated there undetected.
In northeast Nigeria, extra vaccination of children against polio will begin as two children in the sickness have paralyzed there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that a million children will be inoculated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP, quickly delivered vaccines against polio to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are active.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating in the area for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have prevented vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible on Thursday for doctors to reach areas where children with palsy were detected.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The WHO section director responsible for eradicating polio, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria would begin as early as next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in the state of Borno.
The area was not made available to international organisations and the government until early this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in a major way in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole admitted that new polio cases were a major disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio had been eradicated in it.
The WHO pointed out that it was possible that although the disease had not appeared for two years, it was still spreading among the children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While polio was still in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and the north of Nigeria.
The Pope met former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the troubled stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who were leaked from a shepherd gang thanks to the police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look with confidence to the future.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a strengthening of the fight against him.
In Rome, Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who were freed by the police from the power of a gausage gang of herth.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the troubled stories of the fallen women for more than an hour and subsequently urged them to look confidently to the future, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes visited by Francis were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one each from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All were subjected to severe physical violence during the Vatican's forced prostitution.
By visiting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a heightening fight against him, the Pope's spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fates of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican in April this year and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will hit the Jihadist's factories.
Without the help of Muslims, however, it will not be possible.
France is to be helped by the Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is preparing major changes in the functioning of the mosques and the education of clerics.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer.
And others will follow, the Interior Minister announced.
There is over a hundred Jihadist manufactures in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state to fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of this religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only the imams who were educated in France mosques and prayer rooms pre-tascending.
At the same time, it wants to stop funding for mosques from abroad.
At the moment, about 20 percent of the money is being spent on foreign landlord for the construction of new mosques, most from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This, too, is then the preachers who can sow radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the prime minister added.
The key to ensuring that these goals will be met will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The country is now served by the French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, the foundation was supposed to contribute to making the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institution was soon hit by internal divisions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation eruazed.
All was hastened by further terrorist attacks in France carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalised Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently let it be known that a new foundation will be created in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to secure the funding of mosques from indigenous sources, as well as to oversee the imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centres.
But several proposals are being considered.
One is a special fee or tax on halal food.
This would be paid for in practice by the sellers of halal food, for providing certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation's purse.
The allowance of ten to twenty euros ($270 to 540) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year there is about 30,000 of them there on the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, only preachers who have undertraveed special educational programmes at French universities should be active in the mosques in the future.
This should ensure that the sermon is in line with democracy.
Radical mosques will close.
The French government is simultaneously in a campaign against the militants.
Others will follow, the Home Secretary recently announced.
In France, there is no place for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of our country's principles, such as equality between women and men.
The country is estimated to have about 2,500 mosques and prayers.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled some 80 imams, and for several dozen more, they are considering it.
But not everyone thinks that the government's actions can make a significant impact against radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalised will do the same.
This is not the case in mosques, young people are radicalised online, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Centre for Scientific Research.
The track, Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint to the star Baugém.
The Czech track cyclist must fight for the last eight in the final rounds.
The track cyclist Pavel Kelemen lost the first round in the first round to the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games after advancing to the top 18 of the sprint qualification, the French great Grégory Baugé, the defending silver champion from the previous London Games.
He must fight for the last eight in the correctional runs.
The start of the royal discipline on the course was set up by 27 riders and the best Czech tracker of the present day claimed the 14th best time.
He made the 200 with a flying start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main knockout stage, he was expected to be in qualifying fifth-placed Baugé, who already has bronze in the team sprint from Rio.
Although he nailed the experienced Frenchman to Kelemen in the end, he took a look of the process.
A brilliant performance was flashed by the defending gold champion, Jason Kenny.
The 28-year-old Briton finished the third fastest 200 in history and won qualifying in an Olympic record of 9.551 for the Olympic record.
He then easily, as expected, also dealt with the last run-in, which was German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet also flourished with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50.570 in the 4 km pursuit to advance to the final.
The previous best (3:51.659), which the British had been in the competition for four years since the London Olympics, were improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the field
Representatives of the young doctors met to approve the new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Council of Junior Physicians (JDCs) to the British Medical Association (BMA) must seek the full council to support further industry events in early September.
JDC says ministers have failed to resolve the issues regarding the treaty.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government remained "quietly" on the issues, which is a great deal to reject the contract.
She said: "In this light, the executive branch of the Executive JDC voted to reject the proposed new treaty in full and to request new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA board to approve a running programme of heated industry events in early September.
The dispute led the young physicians to be announced in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA's young doctors, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned following a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told the BMA members at the pre-call-call meetings in front of the 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the health minister said the treaty would be a burden for the medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of the "incompatible"?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to the eight-month war of war of long, the war of words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart to the sumptuous hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
There were hands on, yes.
But Putin did not smile, and he was hardly warm-punished, even by his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his "dearest friend" to Mr. Putin - five times, as one of the reports reports.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
To me, his enthusiasm betrayed the exact opposite.
But the lingering chill that emanated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: Shooting down a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow's response at the time was furious.
Putin was throwing punches around him, accusing Ankara of driving a knife in the back of Moscow.
The outrage was all the greater because it came from a supposed friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to rebuild real trust.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, the state-controlled media ran a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to be to the task.
More serious was the accusations from top state officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology he had asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some victory as well.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost stripped of power during the failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have visibly shaken him as well.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions have had a harsh impact - mainly the cancellation of charter flights, which are transported annually by several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey.
This number decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will surely relax here when flights are eventually resumed.
They make money on the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkish are again allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemosti newspaper report.
But the visit was of further political value to Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a feeable response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-running animosity of lengthy EU accession talks and the accession of Putin - eager to take advantage of the cooling and break the ties of Turkey and the West.
The Russian leader certainly scored bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, it is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace to Russia and Turkey allowed you to demonstrate what one analysts described to me as "allied to the incompatible": how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the West are joining forces.
However, despite publicly showing reconciliation between them, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently stood as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
You could say that after nearly three hours of initial interviews, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately evicated the answer to the question of the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two states can find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and the risk of total disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least talking to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank's managing director. The RBS brand is to be quench of the role of the back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland is lost to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
It eased off them when it almost died eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, the strategic brands used "RBS" to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was worth millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to the Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But it has now been decided that it is better to give more of the national brands to excel.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock codeing, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already in use.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that come to the fore - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During his travels to customers and employees at Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan's questions.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand that our employees work for, because we are becoming a bank of brands much more now."
As the bank itself became a global brand, it also became a global brand for RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts aimed at the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in its own communities and our workers will work under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championships, preparing the profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
"Has it been a good time for us to move on to the brand's bank, because the basic question (which we ask) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had said that we would become a great bank for customers and introduce the brands.
But along with the focus on the needs of customers, not our own, I think there are a lot of changes.
We can recall these brands in a lot, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horse Predilection to the finish line of 3000th
Dettori spravele champagne after double victory in Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in Britain in Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second victory of the night on his local track - a horse of Predilection, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in the flat.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time choroos Dettori, who had previously won a horseback, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is also here
I am extremely pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I docked up 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not the Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on the floor with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and I'm very grateful.
Dettori gathers congratulations when he brings Predelithection after victory
Two jocks reached that milestone in the hurdles race - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who have led to the finish line of more than 4,300 winners during their career breaking records.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jops of modern times and is not a surprise that he reached the milestone, which only a few riders have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fištrón that distinguishes him from the other drivers in the weighing.
He is a fantastic ambassador for the race, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn't only run on weekends and big races, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
However, the truth is that Frankie rode the winner in the UK for the better part of his 30-year career, and that is really something.
He has a vivid character, which is good for the British racing sport, but more importantly, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump
From the summer finishes to the fleeting jump - Frankie Dettori has been a messenger of the British flat-runches for two decades.
It was like a roller coaster ride.
An unrifeasant number of winners of major races, including his well-known "great sevens" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and was banned from taking off for drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a 6-month ban on the start, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned to all the doubters in the best of shape.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue racing until at least 50.
Russian President Putin dismisses presidential chief Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin abruptly dismissed Sergei Ivanov from the post of president's office as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov has been one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
The 63-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Putin "recalled Ivan from his services to the head of the Russian presidential office," but no reason was given.
His seat will be taken over by Anton Vajno, who had been Ivanova's deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vajno was previously a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokiya.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When he appointed Putin, he said, "Thank you for your confidence."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as the Head of State's activities in the sense of draft laws and the control of the extent to which your guidelines are respected.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be relieved of the post and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Convincing smiles?
This move has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for a long time and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, both men said he was leaving the presidential office's post at his own request.
But the smiles for the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man who was once thought of as a possible president is suddenly eager to conduct Russia's environmental policies has been met with a lot of mistrust.
The Kremlin website quotes remarks made to Putin, in which Ivanov states: "It is true that in an interview I asked you to give me four years in an interview for this very demanding post, you might even say a problematic post.
I seem to have been chief of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov to one of his five closest associates.
Indeed, it was speculated at the time that Ivanov might succeed Putin at the head of state after his second term, because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin's Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, star of The Ideas of the Criminal, was released after being hit by the director
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his firing.
There were creative differences on the stage and disagreements.
I'm sorry that this happened,' he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS, details are details of how the character of Gibson disappears from the series, which follows the stories of an FBI team of a team of agents, is missing.
The 54-year-old actor, made famous for his role starring in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has starred in the series since the first season in 2005.
"I love the Thoughts of the Criminal, and over the last twelve years I have given the heart and soul to them," Gibson said in his statement issued on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that would not be possible now.
I would like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show has ever been hoping for.
The series is expected to return to the 12th series on September 28.
In the city of Banff, fish mysteriously landed in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish may be the sand-elves left behind by the water storm.
Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, posted a short film of his find on the Periscope Canal, thinking that someone might help him explain how the 5 centimetre of the fish got to his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
£1.35bn project to be completed by May 2017
The engineers have connected the northern platform and the Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - so the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of the four caps between the "spectaters of the platform" which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It features 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 suspension ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the construction today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all see how the civil engineers used more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel in an impressive scale to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the cap between the viaduct and the platform of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, the concrete for the last part of the platform is now being pledges in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to be highlighted for the bridge.
Michael Martin, the project leader for the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure for the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of the building building.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion plateau, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres south.
This was both a massive and very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6 000 tonnes and was necessary to drag it with a climb of about 3%.
Delican because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, everything was going very well.
Saving in Moelfre Bay: Three men are 'happy to be alive'
The three men are "happy to be alive" after being washed down by the water from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Boat Station raised the alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. on Friday, British summer time, after the crew saw the incident at Moelfre Bay.
All three of the men tried to swim to safety as their boat continued uncontrolled.
"We saw their boat circling in their vicinity, and we thought of the worst," said the helmsman of the lifeboat Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong wind blew him away from them before we left them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man aged 60, found without a life jacket exhausted as he clinged to the buoys.
All were transferred to the deck of the Coast Rescue Boat and take them back to the rescue boat station
Jones said, "Three men topple into the water are happy to be alive and unhurt.
The ship's engine had a rope to be cut off, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the overturning.
Someone from above was holding a protective hand over the boys.
The judge refuses to settle the case because of Tluchor's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three deputies who, according to the indictment, were to receive a political tobacconist from Prime Minister Nečas and his then cabinet chief Jana Nagy, a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Shnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř allowed him to resign by their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential posts in state-owned companies.
So, too, they also faced suspicion of a bribe and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, they were wrongfully, and they received compensation of almost CZK 2 million in total.
Tluchoř is now a witness in the case, following the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in the courthouse on the Fruit Market and is working out civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious (re-rebutt criminal matters) and avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be put in charge of another Prague court district.
The king has already twice exonerated Jana Nečas, formerly Nagy.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track down the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
In this case, Tluchoř was not featured.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessarily overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in this way for a court to be excluded if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in the court of the court.
I'm afraid there's nothing to be judged after that, he noted to the Journal.
"It seems crazy," he added.
The case of political tobacconist is also charged with Roman Boček, a former official.
According to his lawyer, Petr Toman, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 heard the indictment of the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas, Jana Nagy (now Nečas) and other accused in the case of abusing Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečas and her husband come to court.
Tluchor was to address the statements about Peroutka.
The ex- exec's wife, for example, was to try President Miloš Zeman's remarks about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he had sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She flew to Syria, along with her two equally old girlfriends, from London's Gatwick Airport last February.
The British Home Office did not comment on the news of her death.
Young Londoners who escaped from home were secretly taken to Syria via the Turkish border, according to police.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana headed for their other former classmate at the Bethnal Green Academy, according to the media.
The case drew a huge wave of attention last year, as did tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, about 50 of them young women and girls.
A number of them joined the militants of IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream job for a $ 100,000 salary.
A well-paid job you don't even need a college job.
This is what the I.t. a.t at first glance is the job of an I.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech conditions (you earn up to CZK 180,000 in IT work in Prague), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to the huge shortage of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most wanted, according to statistics from the staffing agency Grafton, are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
So the candidates will not be rivals for the job position, but the jobs for the candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Meanwhile, university education is not a necessity for I.t.
Higher education means a good basis and is an overall indicator of the candidate's intelligence and education, but it often has little to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to learn new things all the time, which will not be replaced by a graduated college, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most profitable is in Prague.
I.t.M. wages everywhere move high above the Republic average.
The most money will come to be in Prague and Brno, it is not such a hit parade in the regions.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those of Prague," confirms Kubačka.
The highest earnings will be achieved by technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below CZK 80,000 there either.
Also called are IT project managers.
When they start, they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
There is also a fight for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this is not the case for I.
In fact, if companies are to be outmasted and overcharged by an expert from another company, they will be happy to reach for a graduate.
They can raise him their own.
They can't do without a language.
The knowledge of a foreign language is useful in every profession, but at least decent English is required for I.t.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we see a number of cases where companies are looking for a particularly well-educated and experienced person, and are content only with the average knowledge of English.
However, for example, if the support worker controls more than one foreign language, he is of interest to his employer because it can serve more customers from different countries, adds the director Kubačka.
Yeah, at Google, there's a paradise.
Only quietly envy can Czech workers at Google's employees.
Of course, there is flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs, not just for mums.
"The company provides new dads with four extra weeks of leave after the birth of a child," says Martina Joneková, a Google spokesperson.
The covertia also involves health care for employees and the family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to be educated has the green light and no matter what new one wants to learn.
But the benefits don't stop there.
Such a full free fridge is definitely not a throw to be a throw.
A healthy lunch (blaunches and dinners in some locations) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchecilies in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the speaker reveals.
And to avoid getting fired, if nothing is to be asked, they put in boxes that the staff can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these unbelievable advantages for Czech standards?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"It is not important for Google that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, a shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the spokesperson adds.
The UN sharply criticized Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN Human Rights Commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalising refugees.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "crave serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly worrying to witness how important and influential public figures publicly express support for the criminal armed fighters who boldly hold fugitives on refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into the Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
Worse still - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalised despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, 2100 in the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to see the world change.
Many people have lamented over the last decade that teenagers and children are no longer playing outdoors, preferring to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people out of the sofa and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of screens was originally shaped into television, later for video games and, most recently, smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and activities out there are no non-recalation.
I am, of course, talking about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late '90s (later a cartoon, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game at the beginning of July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter in a few days.
How does it work?
In short, the smartphone players go out looking for the Pokémon, which they track with GPS, and when they find them, they can "take them" (over the screenshot on the phone) or "catch."
Mania has engulfed a generation that played the game at a younger age, lifts it from the seats and drives out to find Pokémon.
In the US, this game has seen a significant increase in the number of steps that the "average" person will take every day.
The Apple's smartwatch Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people surveyed who practiced for 30 minutes each day has jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who plays Pokémon Go - it sees only rough data on the exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to make people "file 30," "left from the couch" and "are active every day" fall to barren ground, because most public health-related messages are boring and designed for people who don't look good.
Yet the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in controlling weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot mention in full here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight.
Some people even make new friends in the hunt for pokemons.
As is usually the case, of course, there will be some boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And, yes, someone could walk in the door.
What, like?
There was a breakthrough.
In their day, smartphone apps, like Fitbit, could track our activity, but gave us no reason to do something, as it does with this game.
The novelty is being looked at and the interest in it begins to fade at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, more games will emerge that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people in pursuit of activity, health and a better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic to jump.
No effort on the beam.
By the simple, they all were dreous.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in the multi-arrest on Thursday, overcoming the others at full stretch under the Olympic spotlight.
The overall result of 62,198 was clearly confirmed by her lead over the silver medalist and "final fifth" team member Aly Raismanova and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a casserel appearance in the final of the individual's multi-fighting team at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the multi-eight, and fifth overall, by confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final standings were on the board and her long journey to the end of that moment, tears came to her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of rare athletes of his time as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 gold. Her stunning line-up is a mixture of ambition and precision, and the 1984 Olympic champion, Mary Lou Retton, called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the competitors, but between her alone and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than a return home to his family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are embracing the final of the individual women's multi-choums after winning the gold and silver medal in the Women's Multi-Afires Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles won the first one on Tuesday, when she was an exclamation point in celebration of outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she never looked forward to the top during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her lineup in the toll - the one that contains a typical triple, double-turnover, flip-file for her - is set in Latin music that would just be suited for home, to the streets outside the Olympic arenas in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by the coach's mother, Aimee Boorman, on her way to the gym, where Boorman was training and where she gained strength.
She has not lost the competition in the multi-fight since the summer of 2013 - this is a succession of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafinova took the lead for a short time through two turns, it was just an illusion.
The Kladina and the standstine - where Biles is defending the world championship - awaits.
She went back to the lead with 15.433 points on the beam - and completed with 15.933 points in the clear.
Raisman hugged her gently as she waited for the final score - a mere formality - and tears welled up around the glittering red, white, and blue shadows, when the wish she had once made for her little one to write in her diary.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she was a third-place finish with Mustafin, but then she eats bronze because of the top three lineups.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who the Americans call "Grandma," was way ahead.
After her own simple, she sent air kisses to the crowd, overcoming by a return that seemed uncertain at times.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted to Twitter this week, where it became a complete hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a girl, aged 12, died in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while they were in a car, chatting and listening to music.
Authorities reported that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The report states that the armed man was on the passenger's side and fired eight rounds from a handgun, then fled another vehicle.
According to police, the robbery is not worth the triplet's murder because the assailant did not take his wallets, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims was carrying.
A spokesman for the Phoenix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators were investigating whether the shooting was related to any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Hispanic neighborhoods, there were a total of nine attacks in four months in which seven people were killed and two others were injured.
"It's going to be in the residential area in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for a CBS branch of KPHO.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and daughter of Ellis Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, the target of which was an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder. Police believe it was the serial killer.
Investigators found shell casings and from the remains of bullets in the seat and from under the hoods of the engine they assembled a bullet.
Mother of six-year-old child with microcephaly: ‘His condition improves’
Like most children of his age, Edmund Picciuto loves to sing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, it was the first time I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are ready for it,' she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, had learned that Edmund might never have known them, and that she might not survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people didn't do this anymore," Picciut explains.
Edmund comes with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't.
But some milestones are already being filled with.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth is performing a sign language with which Edmund says "please, sing to me."
"We're learning him sign language," Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - he says that Edmund made some of the characters himself.
Microcephalia can emerge from a number of different conditions: genetic, as is the case for Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and forecasts may differ in a substantial way.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciut recalls the emotional tax that an uncertain future takes.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure about that.
In fact, I never asked what the overall forecast was, because I don't expect anyone to even tell me.
Picciut, however, has an encouraging report to the mothers of all the children suffering from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods required rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare an emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after the extreme downpours, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi would be pour out of their banks and threaten massive flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said civil servants were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance was already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's National Security and Emergency Agency Office for Emergency Situations said they were receiving vehicle requests for water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa precinct alone asked for ten thousand sandbags.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The Meteorological Service said in a statement that there could be another 8 to 13 centimers of more rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, the flood patrol was on alert Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite rivers at Baton Rouge and Amite are forecast to peak at Denham Springs this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of houses in suburban areas of the Baton Rouge.
He further said that the danger was flooding downstream in the Ascension district, when these swollen streams would be slowly to be pour into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, slightly further south of the Mississippi Liverpool-Liverpool-rislo, Louisiana, reached its highest level recorded at the level at 9 a.m. local time on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the torrential waters of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of the Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were previously among the protected at the Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 metres from his home, quickly rose overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had her up to the waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the stream in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all the members of his family were disabled and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers rescued all three of the military-style huge trucks and transported them to the fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, the flooding is "fast spread" and authorities are considering evacuating.
According to Krautmann, the observer near Livinston announced that 35 centimetres of rainfall fell from midnight to Friday to morning.
Krautmann said the land had been heavily soaked up since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid-for trips required rescuing residents from their homes in Tangipahoaa district and the cancellation of instruction in five school districts.
The CBS branch of the WWL reported that 200 homes had been flooded, according to the elder Tangipaho.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, both of which are now in the swelt.
The mayor of the municipality, Robby Miller, said the authorities rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals that were imprisoned by the high water.
Shelters were set up in the municipality of Amite and in the town of Hammond for those who were evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the Tangipahoa district in the city of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and local residents were given bags of sand to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"The last major flooding was in March," said the city's manager, Lacy Landrum.
It seems that these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis crisis manager at Harrison, Mississippi, said that persistent rain continued on the Gulf coast.
He said a few home floods were reported Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of the Shopper Value Foods in the Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - 'cholan blasted as a screasted', survived shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia. This week, this is the second shooting at a child aged 6 in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including the groin, foot, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when transported to the hospital.
'He caught an awful lot, his little body was shot through like a screens,' his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was to enter the first grade of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown section.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, the other two victims are in stable condition.
According to the station's reports, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle, along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are looking into whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was likely to be a shootout between several armed men.
Casing was found at the scene from weapons of an offensive type belonging to various offensive weapons.
By all accounts, it was certainly an ongoing battle.
There were shell casings on both sides of the side of the side of the street.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi said.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been detained and police are reportedly examining video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this one girl, was shot in the arm with a stray shot in front of a home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane on Tuesday.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second: There are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young colorful girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally, we have a team that looks like America.
He also reinforced the presence of black women and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnasan in the past four years has been an African-American woman.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic champion, and America cheers.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who had performed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women's multi-eight.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing a sporting peak, but it doesn't look like it in gymnastics class in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same journey to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnasts' team for the next Olympic Games will only be made up of four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially challenging sport, and gymnasts train mostly in private gymnastics clubs, which keep parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their charges and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, the gymnasts have all the training sessions and it is a costly and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts and gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, the coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring in gymnastics training, which are more accessible and accessible communities of countless young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or at low cost at Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly of black and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve to be able to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifetime benefits for good health, achievements in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will be sent to us by thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participating in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for demonstrating "chin power" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for encouraging so many young girls of all backgrounds to set a journey on the path to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt's motion to be rejected, young doctors are ready to enter more strikes
Ministers hoped that after the reworked contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements over the changes would be terminated. But 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the elections rejected the treaty.
In July, Hunt uncovered plans to force the contract, saying that the NHS was in the "nobody's land" and further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend working practices to improve care in non-social hours.
In a statement last night, doctoral commissioner Ellen McCourt, the president of the BMA's Young Physicians, said: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labor force crisis and thus fair treatment of all doctors."
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under the new contract, progress must be made and the time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through the negotiations have been met with a reluctance to involve dr and often a deafening silence on the part of the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this possibility is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for the honors, and resolve the concerns of the young doctors."
If that doesn't happen, then the young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called to take the standst together for the doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped that after the reworked contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements would be made about the changes.
BMA wants higher weekend pay for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers, called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said, "Finan or nothing at all is achieved by the challeram action, but there will be pressure on already overburdened teams and services and the concern, exhaustion and disruption for patients, nursing staff and their families will increase."
Over the past two months, we have been in talks with the Young Physicians' Board of Youth and the Ministry of Health and the others to respond positively to concerns about the role of supervision and the informant.
Employers had hoped that the continued positive involvement of other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after a career break, the cost of training, mutual recognition of subjects, sabbatical sabbatical and the gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health took the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A cure for sixty crowns per day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs around sixty crowns (two pounds) at a cost. Authorities recommend administering it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The drug to the precipitation of blood Ticagrelor reduces the risk of seizure again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of a stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer yet another stroke or heart attack.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which creates a continuous layer on the arteria walls.
If this layer is disconnected, a blood clot may be formed, the blood access to the heart may be blocked by the blood and the heart attack.
If the clot is released, the bloodstream can continue, blocking the blood flow to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca, which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of the emergence of clots less likely.
The NICE proposal for a directive, which was published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life.
It is shown that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are delighted to expand the treatment options available to the Ticagrelor to advance the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will benefit from it.
As information on the efficacy and safety of the Ticagrelor - particularly about the risk of bleeding - beyond three years, is not recommended in the proposal for treatment above this time.
With computer culture, fraud in Muslim areas began to flourish
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, which was linked to government news
The culture of political correctness has led to the overlooked fraud in Muslim communities, a government report says today.
Ex-minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticizes the police, election inspectors and town halls for ignoring voter abuse for "sensitive substance in ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion was so bad that the police should make cordons and the frightened voters protect before the polling stations.
He recommended that voters take their identity documents with them and be able to prove who they were at the polls.
At present, voters need only give their name and address.
The report also proposes to put indelible ink on the fingers of the people when casting a voice to the voice to avoid being voted twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It calls for the press to be given greater access to the meeting documents and to decisions taken by the unofficial committees or the group's workmanson.
"This is not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor of the city, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically intervened" with the religious sensibilities of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his words, "taked his campaign to be a religious duty of loyal Muslims, to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and sets out to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud of the correspondence vote - which is claimed to have been put under pressure by the elderly members of the Muslim community to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
His report states: "There has been evidence to be provided that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, were pressured to vote at the will of the elders, in particular in the communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh."
"There were fears that . . . state institutions were closing their eyes to such behavior because of the "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including for political activists to be banned from manipulating correspondent votes to prevent "envy."
The report, now being assessed by Theresa May, also asks for more in-depth checks on registrations to prevent the use of the electoral rolllists for immigration fraud and benefit fraud.
To consider the possibility of asking voters to provide proof of identity before the vote.
The use of indelible ink on the people's fingers in the vote to avoid being voted on.
The implementation of systematic checks of the nationalities of the persons to ensure that they can vote.
Restricting applications for automatic correspondence voting to a period of three years.
Forbidting political agitators and activists to manipulate the submitted correspondence votes and campaign envelopes.
Germinate the police the authority to create cordons around the polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute those who exert illicit coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Forbiting the taking of photographs at the polling stations.
To require that only the English work at the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Strengthen training and ensure that workers observe the rule that voters go to the ballot to the ballot individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Electoral Affairs Committee has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - the strength of proof of the crime.
He also criticises the fruitless "check check of the check boxes" in the city hall's registration departments.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's court decision in the Tower Hamlets case awakening.
Our nation has the proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten this reputation.
The fading with the cycling doppelganger of Duchess Kate and other doppelgangers of well-known personalities at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have gone mad at French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is strikingly similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete aiming for gold this year to boast her own double from a ranks of well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the well-known figures currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women's column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely like Hollywood celebrities.
As game hunted: U.Schallion team member Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a little girl
Alongside the Kate doppel on the cycling track, a number of people quickly pointed out online that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
The competitor from the team of American archers, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures emerged, in which he looks remarkably similar to the Wall Street wolf.
Braddy himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted to hearing about his similarities with Leo since he was a little girl.
"He doesn't see much of a similarity myself, except perhaps the beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular London 2012 comparisons will no doubt be highlighted even more this year: a striking appearance between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliy Mustafin, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series, Gell Matthew Morrison, for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan with an "atletic version" of the actor from Origin (Inception)
Another years' comparisons are the aligned with tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same dark skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And of Nathan Adrian of the US team, fans say she looks like "theathletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Tearning Women: Football's All-Star Hope Sol (left) and actress of the series Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape to face and eyes
Not just one: Twitter's user was very pleased that the similarities were noticed by others
On the Ausages of the Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind similar couples' appearance
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the site that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope and Jennifer Carpenter are identical in truth."
Soccer star Hope Sol and the show's actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face-eyed shape.
Among the other popular comparisons are Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the Gymnasti gold medalist Gabby Douglas, pridesying on her wonderfully wide smile, which seems to follow the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of Bravo Girls, the star of the movie Bravo Girls!
CBC Olympic Games commentator apologizes for saying of the Chinese swimmer that she "swolt out"
Crowd's viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympic Games on CBC were outraged by an analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's performance by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in the fourth place in the women's 4x200m relay in the free style
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "tracked like a smolt" during the race and "hoiled."
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the final, the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay began to chour out his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "a revival" to the CBC's team of commentators, said, among other things, "The little 14-year-old from China gave up, man."
Excessive excitement, it stretched like a stink, exploded.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race at 1:57.79 - a 1.61sec time slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, to allow the Canadian women to touch China.
Viewers in Canada quickly began to sound online and were appalled by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Her CBC announcing that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "fled up"?????"
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air.'
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald's criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his dismissal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald he was, they didn't hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like a bunch of racists.#sdidnied.
Soon after, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's lively commentary and said, "We apologize for commenting on the performance of the swimmer who had escaped the air."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry to hear that happen."
CBC finally apologized to people who tweeted more than 90 times in response to a comment
Co-commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and placed their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained to the MacDonald's comments
The station also quickly apologized and made a statement.
She sincerely regrets the words being uttered, not to get on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and those who watch us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, this was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron apologizes deeply for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live television and attempted to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want to sound like a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said on the broadcast from the Olympics on CBC.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer as such."
"There's no need to say that I had no intention of disrespect, and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark scandalized by a woman who shamelessly tried her underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman took off her clothes to try out her panties on the sales area in the middle of Primark, the shoppers were not sure which way to look.
To make it even worse, she tried to see her size fit, to take off her panties and return them back to the shelf.
She continued to browse, and finally tried out four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried on her panties before returning them to the shelf
The mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said the mysterious woman had "dressed up again after trying her underwear and came out of the store without buying anything."
She said, "The pdd of them couldn't believe their eyes."
She was standing in the middle of the store, taking her panties off the shelf, taking off her own tights and panties, and putting them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she was just standing there, rude as a monkey."
"Everyone just stared at the way she took off her panties again, and evidently didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, dressed again and left.
"She looked like she didn't mind who was watching - or even thinking about the man who might be buying the panties she was trying to."
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said, "The idea of someone taking home the panties that someone else was wearing and not getting cleaned. That's gross."
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added, "When she left, I gathered up things she was clearly trying to get them off sale - what's the only right thing to do, either."
"I'd be hilled by the idea of bringing new panties home and finding out that another woman was wearing them, undressing them, and not being washed."
A spokesman for the Primark store said, "Primark knows about the incident that occurred at our shop at Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9."
All the products in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend against a gun attack with Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, the grand master of the New York-based Krav Magy Federation, to see how to cope with armed robbers at a close range of distances.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the superiority over the rapist, whether he comes nearing the front or the back.
If they come near the back of you, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "hate a free-tat of the missile."
You will then sear the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free elbow.
Then he follows the knee to the groin, and while the attacker writhes in pain, you wriggle the gun out of his hand, hit him in the main face and begin to retreat, keeping the gun at him.
If an armed man approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab the weapon and roch it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, put force on the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then froch the weapon from his grip and start retreating, still aim at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video, where you'll see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of the ambush - unless you're the grand master of Krav Maga - is to hand over all the cash.
Traveller Ian Wright olilizes the dirtiest places in Europe to the travel guide
The British traveller decided to subject him to a severe test of his immune system and a haggiving reflex - licking the dirtiest and most easthable places in Europe.
Moderator and travel writer Ian Wright (51), originally from Suffolk, as a token of the strength of his immune system, he weathe his tongue to the euro banknote, the railing at the Piccadilly Circus, the flusher button on the toilet on the train, and the Russian public phone.
Before wearing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment, based on which Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was shot, however, yielded interesting results.
The idea of licking the flusher button on the train used by thousands of other people may seem absolutely repulsive, but for example in the kitchen sink there are actually many more harmful bacteria.
Throughout his trip around Europe, Ian Wright spoke to health-care doctors and specialists about the strengthening of intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licked left him any worse than the aftertaste in his mouth.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on the road around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system quite safely - from the public railings at the train stations to the flushed
In the film he shot about it, he says, "I've been very unmistakable about my health since I was a little old, and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms and muddy water."
In the film, he certainly confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple luminaometer swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick it after his luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio made a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in various places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said, "This is almost the ugliest I've ever felt in the bathroom."
Nothing dirtier than this doesn't exist!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was shot in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio's senior vice president of refreshments, juices and new categories, said: "We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the fasce while allowing us to explain the benefits of the probiotikes.
We've devised a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They say interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of bowel health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humour in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked up some of what I wanted him to do - like that disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
It was naturally easier for Ian to sick some things, others pretty hard.
I'm glad we filmed the cue of some of the dirty stuff."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 showing that 84 percent of respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and gut health, and 58 percent of respondents said they at least occasionally used products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of socially needed before evicted vandalized a municipal building in the town of Saltash in Cornwall
The family of the socially needy left £50,000 in damage to their municipal house after being charged with terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in the city of Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forcible evictions from the house, housing association officials were shocked to discover that the property was in a state of disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the flooring was torn, garbage was litched on the floor, and the walls were scrawled.
The family has already moved out and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing on housing at Cornwall Housing said she was worried about whether the house could be rescued.
She said, "It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property will probably come into the consciousness of "not such a nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is notorious, and their names are notorious.
The couple has three sons who sometimes stayed in the house, and police said that the reel that the family owned was a street fight involving baseball bats, intimidating surrounding residents, drug use of drugs, and loud shouting, arguing and cursing.
Skeldon (47), whose name was on the lease, was given a sentence in June for anti-social behaviour.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, they were found to be bemic with scanting garbage.
The house from which the drugs were distributed in the past was torn out by the floor cover
Neighbors say they've been seen fighting in the street, and people have called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the house this week after receiving an additional 11-week period to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved greeted the eviction, saying that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't look for anyone at all."
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was incredibly quiet here - we're not used to that!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the supervisor in Cornwall Housing's neighborhood, said the family had failed to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called to the house by the police
Garbage and old toys were lying in the overgrown part of the municipal house
He adds: "It is a disgrace that the tenant has failed to accept responsibility for her own behaviour and the behaviour of her family. The eviction is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to be terrified by their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who bravely informed us.
I hope this move will bring a little comfort to the neighbours and, at the same time, carry a message that we will not tolerate unsocial behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenants' son who lived in the house at different times was in the age of 20.
A polished mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after being evicted
Workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage left around the house
In 2014, the shelf in the house raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of Class B drugs that she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was intended for the foundations of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is thought that Tanya and her partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth after the eviction.
The wits in many of the rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who break the rules of their lease agreements
Angela Crow of the Den and Cornwall Police Department said the eviction was sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and those who would like to follow such behavior," she said.
The police of Den and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and unsociable behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal terrified after low-level over-air of military jet over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun's rays in Aveir, Portugal, were terrified to death
Portuguese Air Force P-3C aircraft flew over the air force to the incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted that there had been no threat to safety
As the low-flying jet descended above the crowded beach, the frightened tourists were in for a panic.
The dramatic footage shows the military plane getting almost a touch from the sunshine people on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of the jet's engines without seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted video recordings of a dramatic flyby on social media, said: "The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to be going to get crashing."
Nuno Arroja adds, "I've been a crash, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head."
Tourists on a beach in Aveir were horrified when a plane flying low in the dark
The Portuguese Air Force today declared that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify the fishing vessels off the coast and had to bear low because it was the only way to check the ship.
The aircraft reportedly flew a little lower than normal, due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that the safety of the people was not at risk.
Forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal this summer, resulting in four fatalities on the island of Madeira.
Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of the thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from viewing
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats as part of his training.
Half of the funeral services are not complying with the regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (ČOI) found this during inspections in the second quarter.
Funeral services are most often not reported by survivors of their prices or issue a written confirmation of the takeover of the order.
The CHOI imposed 41 fines for a total value of CZK 73,000.
This was reported today by its spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich.
Inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified gauge.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
It involved urn wrappers, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with the required information.
"Given that the law is still being violations in this specific area of services, the audit will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiz Sultan, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Tasnime Akunjee's attorney said the family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported Thursday that it was probably killed during a Russian air attack in Raqqa, a stronghold of the country's group.
The sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-turned country and return to Britain.
"It is to be believed that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers of going to the war zone - is that it discourages people from ever making a decision," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from the east of London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as the nominee of the Supreme Court.
Senate leader for the Democratic Democratic Party, Harry Reid, says he believes the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
The Senate Republicans blocked Garland's appointment, though President Barack Obama had already nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person to replace the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by a future president.
Reid said during a conference call on Thursday that he believed Clinton would choose Garlanda "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid's spokeswoman later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was merely speculating.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "sigh-rage ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the president of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said the republicans that block Garland's appointment were "slipper-sand-station" and "jump-story" Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
He said Trump didn't fit in office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for "women and for men"
Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bell to publish the 2017 calendar, inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of revealing well-known figures, he's trying to find the next generation of top models for his calendar, the NU Muses.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nahety was different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for the women.
He clearly believes the calendar is too.
"We have to go back to depicting timeless and classical naked music, with both women and men feeling comfortable and being inspired by photographs of the female body," Shaw said in a press release statement on the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is the vinyl going: who really buys the gramophone records?
Vinyl is loved by lone men in middle age.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comment section with peppery notes under the pseudonym NeichniOyomělíMužiVředníDku, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of gramophone records is associated with the boom of millennials who want to enjoy the originality of the physical subject, but with a nostalgia of middle age.
Those who have recently bought a vinyl album are most likely to be people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
Nor is it really about the accumulation of an enthusiastic fan - the whole thing has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to retain their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are the YouGov results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a television report, I would be watched by a camera as I set off to a busy Soho street, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesturing widely. Then I would stop by, pull out my arms and say something authoritative, like, "Let's go look at it."
Let's go see.
As Soho's heart is slowly fading from the heart of his charm and charm - the buildings once occupied by independent vendors, hotels, restaurants, and canteens, readys and office supplies are now filled with - several of the fantastic specialist gramophone board stores are still to be done.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I'll stand near the various men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional mood are.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, who I follow from Sister Ray (talle: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (tallements: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looks at the shops to fill out a few hours of time.
I ask him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about three or four thousand recordings.
All the recordings are lined by the walls of his living room - in the picture upstairs (he e-mailed the photo, I didn't follow him until I go home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records he couldn't afford when they were coming out, and he's re-selling what he sold in his youth and didn't have a penny.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and the early '70s. These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12. Back then I was too small and couldn't get them,' he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverti who like to keep the company of themselves. He adds, "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers he meets in the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave, people who had heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old recorders back.
According to my interviews, people of their collections were most often disposing of their collections between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their recorders and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their recorders back," he says.
This could explain the boom in gramophone lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of the gramophone records?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a shop like Phonica that you'll find a pleasant community of people with similar sentinens in the music shops.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly scandalized by the contactless payment system.
Some of the gramophone record fans may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar envelopes of the record album, things that bring back memories of peaceful adolescence.
"I think that filling in the gaps or owning something material can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, I do, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It's an easy way to fill a spot in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" comes an associate from a pile of record.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a record player they never use, while 7% of those buying gramophone records do not have a record player.
At this point of the story, he was probably looking seriously concerned walking through the pile of compilations bossa nova.
The aspect of "troofe" and revival of interest is something that Jonny (42) noted, who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a record player yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead on the record so we can display it on the shelf,"" he says.
The percentage of those is not great, but it happens.
It's more about the product side than the music.
We have people coming in who say, "I don't have a Gramophone."
These are younger people, not the older, grown-ups who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost a full floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors when I arrive.
There are seventy-year-old couples, tourists who take pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops used to be - from the speakers, the latest Wild Beasts pop is heard from the speakers and sex, it is good to see various customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to gauge mental trauma when you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks in Fopp for a few minutes and looks at various gramophone records at the discount.
She is one of those who looks at the windows rather than spend frantically.
He says he doesn't make much of a money, so it's out of the question that she's collecting gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something. But the gramophone records have their charms ..." he sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of the girls in the tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls who are currently clustered around Polaroid cameras. Then, father and daughter decide to buy the gramophone Crosley.
To the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by the record albums Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one's looking at them - perhaps because they're just for decoration, and some of them are so high up on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's purely a "vinyl trick."
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there's not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more time and money is more likely than in other areas, is also the one where it is spent most on the most luxurious goods, as the vinyl is sure.
But while I find that YouGov's results appear to be accurate - at least in the gramophone board shops, they do not take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist, in the gramophone board stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He's certainly not a night of Christmas wandering around the gramophone record stores on Berwick Street, going through the recordings, and avoiding looking at a strange, 30-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenlandic shark is the longest living vertebrate - a video reportage
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows the female, whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 and five metres long
Court in France refuses to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected the order of the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During a court appearance this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 makeshift shops where people sell goods inside the camp, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cutting, selling tea for 50 cents or basic dishes for several euros.
The prefecteta office in Calais argued that the sites needed to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations told the court that shops and restaurants were vital and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups did not provide an addendum to the food for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
The disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 makeshift shops, but stated that Prefect Calais's objections were "completely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food outlets, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role to play in the food than simply feeding food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said the premises provided quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites facing demolition was a café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a nonprofit organisation that offers 200 meals, English and French lessons a day, and asylum counseling for hundreds of unaccompanied minors at risk in the camp.
A petition to protect the "children's" cafe was signed by more than 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter saying that the closure of the café would "be a disaster for these children, some of them only 8 years old."
Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the camp's numbers of refugees rose to more than 9,000 after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer - the highest ever so far.
He thought he was dead.
Ulch revs himself and the volleyball Ústí.
"I've been able to train normally since March," he said at the start of the summer's full strength.
What was wrong?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, then I had heart problems for it.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble was caused by a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years, and I didn't know it.
I was hurt, no one found me anything.
Then the clot went up.
There's a damaged vein in the calf, it's going to hurt all the time, especially when the weather's working or changing.
But nothing to limit me, more like an aesthetic thing.
Were you concerned about your life?
I did.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnice, I didn't know I had an embolism, and I couldn't move there at all.
I threw up blood in the evening.
The doctors told me it was something else entirely, I was finished for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Dřevěnice, and my girlfriend and family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some problems with my blood, that I have to watch myself more when I fly somewhere.
But you can do everything with it.
Only when I wanted to return to the preparation of Příbram last year, there were still problems with my heart.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself for fitness at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it, I'm physically better at it than before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I'm excited, the gang looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers coming.
Perhaps we'll sit down humanely to fit together.
Lift the Mouth?
It had a reputation for being a tin, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it came to be second.
There's a new team in Ústí, with only a few players left.
It was the last one in the offseason, so there's plenty of room to improve.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see who's the baton after the first rounds, we're not.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and he's been through a lot, he'll think about better than last place.
But my coming was unrelated to him, I made the deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend with one of them and it was agreed that he would be here to operate.
I'm not calling a name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He has a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for a lot of decades, he's a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What'll you bring?
This team is going to fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to heckle and I like to get opportunities in a not-y-fledit team.
I have been in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, in Ústí the Australian Boehm is already training.
What does he look like?
I happen to know him, we played against each other in a group at the Universiade.
And we had a few conversations there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the games, so we already know each other in friendship.
We beat them 3-1, I immediately sat it for him at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a charmer.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with the American, he looks like a nice boy, the Brazilian who knows how he will be able to speak English.
You contacted the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, that is, whoever's creating, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately researched what a player he was, I found the internet, how he was playing, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote some messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he'll fit in.
How do you look forward to the No 1 recording position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm going to be twenty-four, and I don't have the temperament to go to rotate.
I'd rather be at the center of the action, I'd rather run the team than be led by someone else.
I probably wouldn't want to play anymore if I had to be like a second recorder and attend to it at full time.When something is not done to the fullest, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
A half-year in the Potters, when it didn't go to Kustov as a captain, got hurt, then there were problems with the money and he left.
We've been climbing ever since, and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, of whom I am a devotee, I alternated with an A and a B.
An excellent year was in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and chose Příbram.
That's where the Budejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold 22.
The short half-hush remains Phelps' domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother cheers in the audience again, and his son Boomer slept peacefully with his headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week to finish my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming competitively and in a few hours it'll be over, he said touched.
In the final, Phelps was nearly two seconds behind silver Japan's Kosuke Hagino, who won the long half-half.
The bronze went to China's Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this event at last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carlo Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to take the same event at four consecutive games.
For most of the race, he and Phelps were held to the lead by another American, Ryan Lochte, and home side's Thiago Perreira.
While the defending gold champion in the final fry 50 put on the crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand their unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the semives' semifinal announcement, he advanced to the final of the 100-meter butterfly.
The leggate of the leggate, Ryan Murphy, who won the signing double, could not be eclipsed by the Legend - he won the double track in Rio after the 100.
He left Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin behind the final, with Russian Yevgeny Rylov in third.
While last year's World Championships, Murphy has only fifth place in the 200, he has become the B signing king in Rio.
He dethroned Larkin, who had just finished the same double at last year's world championships.
At the Olympics, however, he won a medal only now.
The freelance hundred was shared with the gold by Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these Games, for Manuel the second after the relay.
She won the swimming gold at the Olympics as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for all those who come after me, sport becomes love for them and they get to where I go to where I was, said a tearful Manuel.
The third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100 metres butterfly in the world record in Rio and has silver from the 200-seat sketle in the world record.
The sixth was the world record holder, Australia's Cate Campbell.
The Brethre 200 was won by Japan's Rie Kanet, for whom it is her first Olympic medal at the age of 27.
She has no valuable metal or World Cup, her best being fourth in the event in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russian Yulia Yulia Yelfimova, who faces both spectator and rivals' animosity as a start at the Games despite her doping past.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should always answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
She won the Rio start right up to the special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the Games.
They were dealing with my appeal, and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, whether they go to the Arbitration Court, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And take off at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
It was only less than an hour before the game that they learned who they were going to come up against.
They had to quickly master the tactical preparation.
And then, at an unconventional time, the match began on a small No.1 court.
The first set did not start well, then drew the advantage of the opponents, but at 19:19, they failed to make the endgame.
They were clearly better in the second and drew level, but the decisive tie-break failed.
In particular, a number of broken service stations meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann said.
How would you evaluate the match?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start, before I played out, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, in the last balloon, I missed the reception I had gotten used to before.
We lost the set, which was crucial.
In the next set we came at them with a flourish on the pitch, a different defence and we pushed the service.
There was a terribly bad serve in the tie-break, there we took it down on this side.
It was a disappointment because we could have beaten the Russians.
Sluková: Pity about the start of the first set, we missed it there.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and the third was the service deciding.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and the five of them, we hesitated a lot there.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play on the little court number 1?
Sluková: Similar to China's sidewreards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o'clock at night, complete silence, the music not playing, nothing.
That was the difference with the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was special.
We started to warm up for the game without knowing the opposing team, so we couldn't do the tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (kkou nausch) had set up a tactic for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of paperwork with tactics, so that's the point of view, we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at 10:30, but not at 12.
Russian Birlov's block in the playoff round at the Rio Olympics.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in the embrace in the play-off round at the Rio Olympics.
Was that uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two matches in the group from ten, we had the regime shifted before.
This was two more hours more.
It's funny, I can't imagine that another sport has athletes who have to perform their best performance at 12 o'clock.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be like that, but it's not quite typical, and it's probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you rate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since advancing from the group was our goal, it's okay on the one hand, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Sluková: I will sleep with it and from tomorrow I will only remember the Olympic tournament positively.
Big Brother is here, the first stinging SIM.
You're not going to escape it.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM of one of the local operators when they are in Thailand.
That is, not only to tourists, but also to people with long-term visa who work or have married in Thailand, for example.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan for exclusively foreigners was presented by the national telecoms regulator in early August.
The new measure to enable the monitoring of their location intends to be introduced by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of preserving national security to enable the criminal activities committed to be dealt with by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs are to help detect those who are over the authorised stay.
For retailers, a special SIM for foreigners should appear alongside SIM exclusively for Tha's SIMs within six months.
A distinction will be the tracking feature, which will be permanently on for cards to persons without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This SIM feature is not for Thais, because we can always easily track them," Tantasith said.
It should be added that in Thailand the subscription is not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires identification.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave away free starter SIM to tourists at airports.
These were fully anonymous.
The introduction of the same measure as Thailand is being considered by ten telecoms regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia and Singapore.
They are also currently in forceful registration of SIM, however, legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the forthcoming measure does not mean an obligation for foreigners to acquire a local operator when entering the SIM country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short for them.
The operators of that country know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, that is to say, after the SIM has been logged in to their network.
They therefore know the telephone number, but not the information about the owner.
However, the difference in roaming charges compared to the rates of local operators is so abysmal that even most tourists start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities' efforts to have oversight of the movement of foreigners have been legally criticized by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, compares the forthcoming system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if they need to monitor a specific person.
Any abuse of the system will face an unspecified punishment.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he or she will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific figure will currently be recycled only after the expiry of the 90-day deadline for the SIM not to sign up for the network, the number could be restored after fifteen days in the event of leaving Thailand.
The luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment where most of the care of the property is provided by the caregiver.
The condition was enough parking spaces and a lift in the house, which basically disqualified the older development.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with rocking the floor, high energy intensity and the like.
Large terraces were also a condition, which the old development is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová with her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you just approach them?
Would you recommend working with a specialist for everyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to anyone if he designs an apartment from the beginning, it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: the designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client's wishes, are able to match the interior appropriately.
We collaborated with the architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, the obvious choice was for us also during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous socio-residential space with a corresponding background for a family of four conceived as a modern but not cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and implement intelligent home control.
And, of course, it was necessary to control the quality of the design.
Have you left everything to the experts, or have you yourself interfered with the final form of the interior?
We approved all the designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from the architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it was our collection of mostly Czech authors that, including the works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušila, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to navigate our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also the architect's idea as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc.We then verified together whether they are tuning together, we then verified together through visualizations.
Have there been any complications in the implementation of which you had to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, accept new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction at the moment when it was first possible to climb up to the height of our floor, and found that the views we had planned would actually shade the surrounding buildings.
At that time, we changed the layout literally overnight from the ground up.
On the kitchen counter and for the lining of the fireplace wall, granite was used.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complete with leather, such as the upholstery of the Norma and bar chairs by Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes or is there anything you wish for otherwise today?
I believe it is a modern airy interior that primarily serves its purpose.
We are not going to make changes, most of the modifications after the move-in took place in the level of shielding and the setting of the terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, when the nutty wood turns out to us to be too delicate to the household with the dog.
The word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several other modifications as part of the construction.
For the interior, the placement of the flood pipes in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilets are an important feature.
This gave us daylight into the darker space of the apartment.
Also direct access from the main bathroom to the rooftop terrace to the USSPA pool is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
It also includes a swimming pool and a hot tub.
You are not negative compared to the French, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are originally from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, just off the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, which would allow me to get into a job in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was choking in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mostly because of the atmosphere among the people.
I felt like every Frenchman was terribly negative.
People in France are negatively attuned in general, but it has gotten even worse lately.
It's interesting that you mention negativity.
Some people rate the Czech character this way.
Believe me, you are not negative compared to the French.
It may not seem that way to some people when they come to France, because they don't see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, yet the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is, moreover, the problem with people's behaviour towards Muslims.
This is completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street in which I lived, my non-Muslim neighbour started looking at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
Like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel comfortable in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work basically anywhere else and came across a vacancy with Air France here in Prague.
I confess that I did not know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mostly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't pick up any negative reactions or swears, but I feel like people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress however I can and no one will judge me.
In France, you're always uncomfortable, like when you have special clothes and stuff like that.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
Praguers don't care about such things, I think.
Where do you work now?
After my job at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then, with another friend, we set up a website on which people offer and look for shared housing.
We only operate in Prague for now, but we would like to extend this to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are half Czechs and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that the next specificity of the Czechs is that they initially keep their distance more.
They're not letting someone get to the body.
That's quite the difference from where I grew up.
To the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the cheek.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have it pretty simple in Prague because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in convenience stores or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by being able to communicate in English at least a little, I don't have the need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're Muslim?
No, basically.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, the Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something along the lines of: They are not the French, they are Africans.
That touched me quite a bit.
But that anyone would have a problem with being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
This was despite the fact that a colleague once drew my attention to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said not to go downtown, he said they'd call me a call.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to the terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid, for example, that something similar to what can happen in Prague in Paris, Nice or Brussels?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything anywhere can happen these days.
Until recently, perhaps, I couldn't have imagined something like this happening in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
To me, the people who kill aren't Muslims.
The Koran says a man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists being shielded by your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, although I should not feel that way at all.
I try not to watch the news of violence too much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met in the square of George of Poděbrady.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated here against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know about that.
But I take it that these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with the violence.
I don't think they have to do that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My associates, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, maybe they were learning Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate of a woman's position.
How do you feel about that?
I don't seem subordinate in any way.
The opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It has to do with the fact that you don't wear any headgear.
A hijab, for example?
And it's mostly the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a truly principled Muslim.
He praies five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She's always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It's up to everyone how they interpret it.
If you read the Koran, you should make up your own mind about the things.
So when I read a passage in the Koran that says that God told the Prophek to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophete's wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and if I come to, say, Iran or Saudi Arabia, where they require scarves, I'll marry him.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
Nowhere else did I feel so good.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I'm great at Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for this, in my opinion.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against the violence.
Yachtsman Kozelska's Fenclova wind in Rio was blown into the runners-up.
Friday's rides at sea in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were published by Czech yachtswail Veronica Kozelska Fenclova.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth in place before the final two heat rides.
That would give the Czech a participation in the final run.
You pick up the packets as pokémon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea to use the planned shipment trips are the TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, they breathed life into a trio of apps with different geographical reach.
We launched the national application of the transfer in May.
There are 1,000 cities in it at the moment, and we will be expanding the network.
In the Czech Republic, we first want to learn this than we will focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Swaer App work and who can benefit from it?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the data on how big a package you can manage to transport and how much you want for it.
Someone might be asking for a transfer on that day.
When the route and delivery time suit, it is pirating and a mutual notification is for both.
At that moment, the chat room opens, where the pair will arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register for each package to always find their courier?
I do not know the ideal condition, I cannot estimate how many registered and how many paths it takes to be completely optimal for the coverage to be completely optimal and each supply to be made up with demand.
It already works on the main draws and it is logically easier than, say, on the way between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust in the meantime, finding that no one can escape with the package.
Have you not had to deal with such a case yet?
How many users does the service have a service two months after the startup?
At the moment, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people who create the roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that others will be packing.
Doesn't there a danger that the sender will wait too long?
We hope to be a competition for the big conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the item on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
With a large company to deliver in two hours you will pay several thousand.
Here you will pay a hundred or less, because that's a journey that someone is already in business.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about a possible decline in customers in the future?
We hope it will be.
The market has enormous potential, the giant multinational carriers are fed here, as are the retail chains, where they all started shopping and gradually found that the quality was not the one to pay for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox with the note to pick up the shipment at the branch, not until the day after 7 p.m.
By then I had needed the package for six hours and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that doesn't annoy anyone and sends a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a TV director.
In 2014, they began preparing the Shippansee LTD app, which uses the package of already planned journeys between the world's metropolises, primarily by air.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process the company that created applications for example for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming took three quarters of a year and the app was launched in March 2016.
The App, Převez, started to develop in December last year and released in May this year.
It is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mesík and Mesík Profi apps were developed from this January and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to do all these apps from the start, which one day would merchin in one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the app and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been an issue lately, and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Aren't you worried about being in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the boundary of sharing and where the shadow economy?
It's the same, just a different product.
We know that if it's a success and we go up with it, we'll be the next thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even though someone saves and makes a profit, it is not the intention to circumvent the tax authorities and tax inspections.
Every user, either side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make the proceeds.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the transfer earns, or reduces the cost of the trip.
That's the powerful idea that combines interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we'd like this one to get closer together.
They can make nice stories, people are happy to help someone and tell stories about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People, in my opinion, have been missing a personal approach for a long time, we say of this app that it's a service to people to the people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier will not flee with the package?
Each user of the app, together with the registration, will scan the ID card and enter the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give service and man credibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on the rating of the senders.
We will also offer insurance, the details are still being tuned.
The uninsured consignment is guaranteed by a courier in the event of loss or damage, but does not take responsibility for the content under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and he does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or ten kilos of hashish in a sealed package in his trunk, he falls into criminal liability on the sender.
Won't the misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered are, if necessary, the administrator, which is the only one who will be able to consult it, nor are we ourselves able to see it, the data is against the misuse protected.
How much money does a courier get in hand after a successful delivery?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender is charged an extra few percent for facilitating contact.
This money is our profit, but it's only a few percent because we want to push for volume.
The courier can't be accused of not delivering the package when he actually delivered it, the receipt and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can take anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a platoic egg and a bass as a bass of beers.
After that, there is no further restriction and if someone has a place in the car, they will take the fridge.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack the thing if you don't want to hide the contents outright.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand, and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to run the service?
A friend had an idea more than two years ago, back then I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo app with a transnational reach that mainly targets airline passengers.
That's when I told him I wasn't going to look for an investor, but I'd like to become one myself and put savings into it.
The next year took a development than we founded Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on in the first place.
No, we focused the marketing on the Czech Republic, where we try to catch the app because it was all in labor pains and there is still room to deal with and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and we are not addressing the foreign market as much at the moment.
We know it's a long shot, but we're not in a hurry, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was a basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way an upgrade.
I will be transferred when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third Mesík app is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to an exact address to the other side of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Swipper, but the difference is that as a courier you see the shipments in the form of points on the map closest to you, thanks to the geo-locator on your mobile.
The apps for couriers who want to make a living, we called Mesík Profi.
So can anyone make outright make extra money by picking up the packages around the city?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
As everyone's fooling around with the pokemon right now, they can collect this just as much.
You see where the city's commissions are, you come to it, click, and see when it has to be delivered and the package is transferred.
It's cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be central to companies for sending shipments, on the web they will fill in their data about them, so it creates points on the map.
We are then able to make use of the service, perhaps, to be intucroffed every month.
Are you now in the project full-time?
It's for us to be extra for it, but we're normally on the job so we can feed and develop the project.
We're not behind us a strong multinational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other jumped in with more suggestions and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to manage to coax with us not the Czech market, but who should, with pardon for the ball, go with us to a global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is intended to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will be corrected by the second installment, and the solo game in it will be more colourful than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is to be based on the concept of network wrestling in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to the freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using the combat titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will also include levels focused on skilful movement.
They will be reminded of platformers and include puzzles.
To overcome them, therefore, for example, double jumps, running on the walls and a rope slide are essential.
Sometimes, in addition, it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maps resembling a maze and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and slash platforms and close massive doors.
You will thus adjust the form of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and calmer moments to explore the unknown planet.
We'll play for the pawn Jack Cooper dreaming of a career as a pilot.
Cooper, at the start of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimosa, crashed on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
Nor will the wilderness be indulse to him.
In addition, Lastimosa takes fatal blows in the crash, and Cooper is therefore tasked with getting the captain's titan into operation.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he's expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery necessary for the robot repair.
The Cooper's calls to the titanium will also be significant.
Players will be used as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, humorous moments will be created by the robot-decersonated communications.
For example, if the titanium dryly lists all the injuries that Cooper faces in his planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was reported by the Polygon site.
In addition, the result will be possible to assess in two months and Bonusweb will bring you first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 is released on October 28, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the publisher THQ, it acquired a number of its brands in 2013 and the right to use both the logo and the name of the company.
As a result, Nordic released the likes of the Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection package.
In addition, 23 more games are being created for the publishing house, and 13 of them have yet to be revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, while I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, had found a younger man, our neighbor, to be twenty years younger.
I knew it from the beginning - first she was obviously trying to do it for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she dated a similar one before me.
She went crazy for him.
Her voice even changed in those first days, having a girly, voice in love.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she was denying it.
But I was watching the whole thing.
He would come home from work at the time of three-thirty at the time, so she always left for the groceries at three.
Every day she tried to make her see him.
Later I found out that they meet at his house, in the laundry.
How many times did I know they were there.
I got my keys, decided to catch them there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I could never go there, to make that decisive move.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife thought to me.
I soon found out I was manageable, that I would do what she wanted to do.
And I actually did.
Maybe I'm just a little buck.
At the same time, my neighbors suggested to me at the time that she knew about it, too.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all bursts, it would be bad.
That it would affect everyone in the family, only the daughter suspected something.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But I went to his apartment one day to see him, that I needed help with something in the laundry room.
He went with me, and I told him that I had received an anonymous tip, that he was seeing my wife and that everything was suggesting it.
I asked him what he said.
He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, stared at the ground, and didn't say a word.
Then, at that time, I met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it.
She didn't respond to it, and she didn't tell me anything either.
Nobody told me anything at the time.
I'm a man like this who's never gone out much, who has a hard-on-hill to meet someone, let alone find a woman.
So I didn't even think about the divorce.
I kept relying on it to end one day.
I figured I'd forgive her for it all and life would go on.
That was not the case.
And I've basically never come to terms with all of this.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her a lot, but I ended up giving it up for the rest.
He lives in the house next door, and I continue to live with her.
It's just rather than my wife my housekeeper.
At home, she always did everything - cooked, washes, cleaned.
She's hard-working.
I always think she's tried to make no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's good, too.
But sometimes I'd like to pet her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and they all think about our happy marriage.
But she once told me that she had never loved me.
That she liked me and she liked me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see he loves him to this day, he's her god.
And I don't enjoy this kind of life.
Even then, when it started and I carried it very badly, I once told her that I didn't want to live and I asked what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree to it or not.
And I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it, and finally said, "But there's plenty of room."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
After the terrorist attacks, France is escalating the fight against radical Islamists, and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling in to help.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual educated in France pre-sadmate in the country.
It also wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad, with preachers inoculated with jihad often come with the money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it was to contribute to making the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But she was soon struck by internal contradictions, and it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defence Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are roughly 2,500 mosques and prayers in France, about 120 of them serving radical Islamism.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled some 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and have been considering the move for several dozen more.
This week, German police also intervened against the jihadist cleric.
The Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them ran a space where the faithful allegedly radicalized and later attacked the sewg temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate aroreed in France about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
It was all hastened by further terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists in the name of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main challenges - to secure the funding of mosques from home sources, as well as to oversee imams.
But it is not yet clear where he will receive funding, even though several proposals are being considered.
One is a special charge for halal food, that is, mainly for meat from slaughter under Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by the sellers of halal food, for the provision of a permit.
Some of the money would then go to the foundation's budget.
The allowance of between €10 and €20 could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them set off from France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, French mosques should feature only preachers who have passed the educational programmes at the universities there.
This would make their sermon compatible with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and others will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
An unknown shooter was badly injured by his ex-wife on Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragagoa, writes the Independent.
The shooting occurred after the woman and her daughter left the garage area in their car.
The man waited in the car outside the mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, the Independent reports.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for the man in critical condition.
The crime took place at about 11.00 in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Citing the Spanish Europa Press, the Independent reports that the motive was probably the unoltroving recent divorce of both partners.
Glitches with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes for light, well-datable meals, but we Czechs are rebels and have our tastes and our heads.
So the summer gardens smell like grilled neck, belly, pork cologne.
Nothing very healthy, not too light, so sometimes with the exception of lettuce or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecuing is economical for a time and crockery, plus it's a social issue, and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make good-taking with delicacies that make a special dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, faste or stew at length.
And they will contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-growned grifs are enough to make the preparation of the fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here, there is even no more time-consuming cooking and chilling of rice.
The paper can only be softened into the water for a moment, and then it is up to the cook's imagination how he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
There's no kelp like kelp.
The advantage of a number of Asian cuisine dishes today is that the raw materials are generally already commonly available.
Including pickled sweet-and-sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but the real pink giard ginger has a unique spicy sharp and delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several vinegar and ginger.
So just buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the attachment with the demonstrable antibacterial effects, which also support digestion and cough or flu resistance, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used mainly in Buddhist and Hindu cultures when serving and decorating dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed banana leaves are widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as well as a "reek" to prepare a variety of roast, cooked and fried foods that are packed in much the same way as foil.
The banana leaf will then pass the dish over to a specific flavor.
We can be bought in stores with exotic fruit and vegetables, even already cut in the shape of wheels.
But choose only the leaves of the rich green and therefore healthy - unscathed and spots.
Similarly easy is the preparation of the salad from the wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought again frozen.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi will probably know the kelp of nori in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which it is made by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - the plates designed specifically for making sushi.
Wakame − a deep green kelp growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido - is also eaten fresh and dried and as popular as the kelp nori.
By the way, who doesn't know miso soup with wakame, allegedly Asian women have used it for a post-birth recovery.
And this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleans blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents the hair from graying and is literally charged with minerals.
Dried and broken wakame also serves as a seasoning, for example, to season it with rice.
Fresh algae are first let out in the water, then rinse, placed in boiling water and cook for half a minute.
It is then cooled in the icy water, cut out of the centre rib, and continue to be treated as a favourite salad.
But buying it already in the finished, freezing is the easiest solution.
All that remains is to be smothed a roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a longevity bombshell.
If you resist and don't throw in an extra grilled belly.
Eat healthy, easy and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little bit of skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that delicately combines flavours.
And finished in no time.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40g carrots, 40g white radish, 100g green asparagus, 60g salad cucumber, 60g wakame algae and 60g sweet chilli sauce.
A handwrend of chopped coriander, a spoonful of black sesame, a spoonful of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40g pickled gizvora, a little pine nuts.
First, prepare the rolls.
We'll soak the sings of the sings in the cold water for five seconds.
Then remove it and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, in the hot water, cook briefly asparagus shoots, after about three minutes, we quickly cool them down into the icy water to keep them from losing their colour.
Place the vegetable filling on the permitted paper and pack.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumber, which are cut into delicate noodles, mix them with the sweet chilli sauce, add the chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on the rice paper.
Place the asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add the rolls and at the end finish decorate the whole dish with a wakame-kilter, a mango slice, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-seat rugby, Fiji's selection takes gold
Great Britain's impressive performance in the seven-seat rugby ended in a devastating hitchhike at the last hurdle, beating the British in the final match on Thursday night at the Deodoro Stadium 43-7.
The Fijians performed a master lesson in the processing, the landfill, the eveces, the support game, the line-up and the brutal powers - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unseeded consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inauguration Olympic Rugby Rugby Rugby Olympic tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and the Republic of South Africa.
A win over the South Africans 7-5 in the semi-finals that same day, she may have froze them in the final.
However, Fiji, in his form, would also be beaten by a 15-man team in full health.
Best of first to be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice in the fact that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the Fiddijan's lead coach is Ben Ryan, the former England boss of Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
The Fiji began spectacularly, reflecting the intersections of the British for pleasure.
For captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a row of buses on the move, and the World Cup champions were leading 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau emerged from the corner.
The timer read for four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down to the right wing, which was a conversion.
12-0 and Britain made a hard-on-line touch on the ball.
The brilliant Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only slowed the Fijians.
In the seventh minute, Yasa Veremalua threw a touchdown into the right corner and the British were down 17-0.
Nakarawa added another on his return, and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock ... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated through the languid British and rushed to the line, where he scored.
The conversion to a 29-0 tie was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji had been born for the Rugby 7s, while the British were still learning the graduation ceremony.
This is exactly what it is.
The British made mass changes after halftime and stopped the surge of the Fijians... for the whole long four minutes, which was a good thing compared to the first half until after Fiji Josua Tuisov's brilliant intermature.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, throwing a touchdown to the left corner to the uphroke on an a.m. But the match had long been won by the Pacific Islanders, and their fans on the galleries were singing, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the utterly cheered approach of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweeten the Fijians with another attempt.
The whistle came up, the Fijjans huigled, and the British fell to the turf completely downholstated.
Earlier that day, Fiji had beaten Japan 20-5 in the semifinals, and the UK overcame South Africa in the narrow semi-final - one conversion difference.
Kyle Brown put the South Africans ahead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored under the hook in the second half.
The brilliant late dump of Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony of England's 15th-ranked team, secured victory - and, in the end, a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race were inspired by the cancer coach's battle
You won't find a more emotional gold on these Games - and that's a thing to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 punishing breaths to history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two of them at the jars, there were three voices in the boat. As the boat whirled on the surface to the second Olympic gold in a row in a women's doubles race, the voice of the still-present coach, Robin Williams, was still in the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying across the water with the elegance of the swans - does not reflect the nature of the victory entirely.
Behind every gold medal of rowing is a battalion of the auxiliary hands, which, bit by bit, make a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the coach's hands, who did not know 30 months ago whether he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
In his words, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that could be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without the surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It'll change your perspective.
The cancer was detected by Williams in December 2013.
The fideline for the whole trio was that he could have started treatment at the beginning of 2014, in the off-season, and reduce the shortfall to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get back together quickly.
That was the stimulus.
I was in the hospital walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were on Williams, who was very nervous this morning, talking less than usual, as he tried to cope with his own unease.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who has had a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I've been at the bottom of my emotions this week, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
It reiterates how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked with, and Robin, too.
Up to now it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so he deserves a huge thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better person for training, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair had put on a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
At most, we were focused at the moment.
Helen was yelling, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we had no desire to achieve anything famous.
We didn't look forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to cheer well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The pair will take a year to think about it before deciding what happens next.
Glover is getting married next week, her expecter is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to savor that moment.
I didn't want to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took approximately six months in London to find out that I was the Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel a lot better about it,' she said.

Prison?
It's more like to drive people over for free, says Taximafie hunter Rubeš to the groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former municipal official in Prague are, as reported by TIME, the defendants.
You have filmed a number of reports in which you have uncovered fraudulent practices as well as those who are to be in the group that will stand trial.
You've faced a few awkward fights with the exposed players about it.
How much is the report on the indictment of the members of the organized group being a breakthrough for you?
I expected there to be a trial.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
I don't think they should be in jail, though.
That's no good.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them by driving all people around for free.
This is a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not see any punishment as effective enough?
What's enough for me is that some of them are so afraid they're not doing the job anymore.
For example, one does a pingla, another makes pizza delivery, and one gave up on it altogether.
The defendants can theoretically receive two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Lock someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the companies they took from it.
For a quarter of a century they were committing to destroy our country's name and stealing people.
So let them make a good card now and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine any other way.
It would work as community service.
Like someone goes to pick up garbage, they'd get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll get probation eventually, and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and subsequently at the Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
He is one of the people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the internet television network Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programmes, now he is preparing the Prague Guide programme, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short stories, Rubeš advises them on the services in Prague rather avoid and what, on the contrary, he recommends to use without fear.
He previously filmed series titled How to Do, City of Fraud?, Life in Luxury, And Fur! and Prague vs. Money.
The indictment refers to them as an organized group.
Police had been following her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They're cute mafiosi, not the kind we know from the Godfather.
They are more about mafiosi - juniors, but they are certainly organised.
Just in guarding each other's relags (the now-Dexican's stations).
Prague is all divided.
I found that the main railway station, for example, is not liked with Paris, Pařížská does not like with the taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everybody just watches over their little place, and each group is kind of organized.
It's obviously a wit-riding net.
But the defendants are a combined total of only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate who warned the driver against checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of the Prague fraudsters in the taxi service are at the rate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones are still on the street.
I am talking about Aleš Ryjáček, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he driers a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Charles Bridge and brings people around.
The last time I rode with him, he asked me for seven hundred in three kilometres.
His police did not detain for some reason.
They've only picked a few people from the whole big group.
The situation, however, is the same in other locations in Prague.
The indictment of seven people, therefore, will find it difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague scourt, which seems to have much larger dimensions.
It's no good, of course.
It will help, but all evil is not eradicating, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who steal from foreign tourists appear at the same places you showed in the reports, the Charles Bridge or in Pařížská Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day and violate the ordinances every day.
It is also ignores both the city's police and the Prague Municipality.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's total indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even if it are only part of the group, will be put on trial.
It's already a breakthrough.
I must therefore ask: do you feel vindicating?
If I took it as satisfaction, that would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be for the centre of Prague to improve.
And even if I feel like it's a little bit better, I'll continue to do so.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still be doing something to remove him.
You can't be content to do that.
But it's not the case, there are more of them, of course.
Are you still trying to confront them in the cabs?
I do test rides sometimes, and I have to say, it's still wrong.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, from the same group, by the way, and was very surprised to see me again.
He charged CZK 560 for three kilometres, although he then claimed it was the sum of 56 crowns (he took advantage of the decimal).
He had a receipt for it, the cops came, and this cab driver was so cute rude to go to those police officers and ask them when someone would finally give him the 56 kroner.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the meter taped the decimal and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Can you say that the insolence of the fraudulent taxi drivers did not back down even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged pointless sums for a short ride?
Their insolence is still incredible.
What happened to the taxi driver claiming 56 crowns?
The police sent him away, saying they could not argue with him at the scene because he had issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem in that court (six taxi drivers and one ex-official).
There'll be a taxi driver on the one hand with his receipts, on the other side, the police.
But according to the Supreme Administrative Court's ruling, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from a taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed the episodes about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
But I've always just wanted to use the footage in a story.
Are you concerned that this fact might protect them from the court?
I hope that any judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not be able to support himself.
You were talking about the trick with the decimal, which is being pushed forward especially in front of foreign clients by underwater taxi drivers.
Is it still up to date, or are they worried about continuing to use this trick after the publication of your stories?
I think we have popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I was driving with a cabbie the other day, bragged before me that he was the honest cabbie.
But then I noticed that a black cardboard was taped from the side of the meter.
When I asked him what it was up there, he said, "You know what it is."
When the fines didn't work too well for taxi drivers, can they be impressed with the trial of their colleagues?
Is there anything that can deter them from fraud?
You talked about how you think they'll always find the way to cheat.
I don't think anything can discourage them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague fortunately prevail.
But do they want to go up against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they miss the art.
He can't walk around much at it, and he can't say exactly what they'd like.
When they held the demonstration (because of the proposal for a full-scale restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it did not sound very clear what they wanted.
They once said they weren't protesting against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it was just the best possible commercial for Uber.
Overall, how do you assess the approach of the Prague Municipality in solving the issue of overpriced fares?
You can see that the criminal police had to step in to sort something out.
The magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole that leaked information, which means the taxi department did its job for several years for nothing.
I hope they'll charge the clerk to the last check-up of all the thwarted checks to realize what he's done.
That's what I find the worst part of it.
I even had a check-out with him, which I only found out from their schedule afterwards.
It has been several months since the latest episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I think especially with foreign viewers, than the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play them the videos.
And then when we walk in the Old Town Square, it's a surprise that the same people who can be seen in the footage are really standing there.
The infamous Prague celebrities.
Seriously, though.
I'd put a fence around them for people to look at them.
The Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a cab when you need to?
Sure.
I go with services where I don't have to pay cash, but by card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatches that are fair.
I only took a cab on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting into the car, "Well, you've got some nerve."
Bém in disguised as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were mentioned back in 2005.
Former Mayor Pavel Bém set out on a control ride in disguise as an Italian tourist in the same year and was cheated at the first attempt by the driver for two hundred.
But the editor, Rubeš, had worse experiences.
The taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for driving from the Old Town Square to Wenceslas Square, which is worth roughly CZK 195 per kilometre, as the report-makers calculated.
The Prague Municipality set the maximum price at CZK 28 per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the recorded reportage: for example, a two-kilometre journey from Pařížská Street to the Johlářská cost the tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
They charge even six hundred crowns for the ride to Angel, which has 2.5 kilometres.
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry, and the longer, the better.
The impurities come out of it well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down by a scalpel, it needs to be gougle out of the folds.
It's not easy and it's not going fast, the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in the Groves approached her work.
Hats off to it: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb and climb down again.
"The restorer should be meticulous, patient, and undemanding to the working environment," she said.
In Frýdlant, this is far from the first of its restoration work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Frýdlant town hall were restored, it also restored the statues of St Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St John of Nepomdlant in Frýdlant in Frýdlant Okružní Street, the Marian Column in Frýdlant or the atlanes in the front of the spa in Nové Město pod Smrkem.
The restoration of the tombstone of Melchior, Christopher and Katerin of Rederne began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements of the dirt and crust are being cleaned, the loosened stone parts are secured against the fall and shift; either they will be anchored to the wall or to each other.
They also face treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be re-atheum.
"Then it will begin with the gilding of the inscriptions on the marble slabs with pure slice gold," said the State Monument Care Officer of the Frýdlant Municipal Office, Věra Sobotová.
There are no records from the past of the tombstone to go through any repairs.
On closer inspection, they take the holes drilled in marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the tombstone's decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the raid by the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
Literally, the gravestone was strived, Sobotová noted.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, restorers are at home with a mild exaggeration.
After the 2010 flood, it was necessary to fix the tombstones that were under the water, restored the baptismal board, the murals in the tomb, and now the tombstone.
"We would like to get into the stained glass windows in the future as well," Sobotová revealed.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, we put money into maintenance and repairs every year.
Restoration work to restore the redern's tombstone will cost a total of CZK 128,000.
They will be covered by subsidies, the city will not put any of its money into this part of the renewal.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from the winnings in the regional round of the Historical City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, clarified the mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The release of the winnings to restore the tombstone was decided by the council.
Experts' views on future developments in selected foreign markets tracked through indexes and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) over a one-month and a half-year horizon.
The markets are dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have guessed earlier in the year.
The US S&P500 index, which was undergoing a 12% correction in February, is now at a new all-time high, now at a new all-time high of 7 percent.
It reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interest of central banks, which in the end have always reached their own.
With US equities at an all-time high, volatility is disappearing again, at the moment at its lowest since 2014, when markets rose happily and without fear thanks to the US central bank's quantitative easing, and where, like today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below the 12 percent threshold.
And so not to be.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual rise in interest rates, quantitative easing in both Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England, which will purchase £70bn of £70bn of bonds, has also lent a hand in the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative easing is therefore pushing already so low yields even lower and contributes to an almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
But there are no risks in sight at the moment, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilising, and Brexit is basically no longer an issue, so we should probably not be too surprised if US equities continued to hold out in a similarly calm regime.
Too bad Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, European Commission chief Juncker said when the French politician (really experienced, as he prowling with so many diverse transnational political policies that we would find it difficult to find a better example of the so-called European elite) appointed the terms of the UK's departure from the EU as the European Commission.
Juncker's selection has been blown out by the hope that it is in the EU's grave interest to look for forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media took the name Barnier as the Juncker War Act.
Barnier is a rock-solid European federalist.
He hates Great Britain.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
It was taken in the way that only he could have embraced it: a hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
Advocates of multilateral regulations co-authored the concept of the so-called Banking Union, and he pushed through legislation with exorbitant hard regulation of the financial sector and services to everything that comes from London's financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and, apparently, unscrupulous negotiator.
That's probably not good news.
How not to remember in this context the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which the balance sheet, the overview and capacity for the empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is also why today, Czechs and Slovaks can be the closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this one.
It would be for everyone's good!
Earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin ruler has released his loved one, Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
His seat will be taken over by Anton Vajno.
Russian media reported the news, citing a report by the Kremlin press service.
Meanwhile, Putin has indicated that he is releasing Ivanov at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast on Rossiya 24, the president said he was reaching out to Ivan's wishes on the appointment of him for wanting to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the replacement at the head of the president's administration, now led by Ivanov's previous representative, Vajno, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63, is described as one of Putin's closest associates.
This former KGB officer has, for example, held the positions of Defence Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in the past.
He will now leave the chair of a member of the president's security council.
But Ivanov, in a meeting with Putin, said that he was actually a record-breaking length of time at the head of the administration as head of the head of the state.
He lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already succeeded in this post.
Neither Kvitova nor the debs Strýcová with Šafářová will play in the final.
So far, neither of Friday's tennis matches has been converted into the final appearance.
Petra Kvitova lost her first fight, succumbing to Monica Puig's Puerto Rican's surprise in sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitova was followed by Czech decathlete Šafářivá with Strýcová.
The Williams sisters were reaching for the win in the first set, but missed two set points and the Russian eventually slayed a set in the shortened game.
The second set was lost by a 4-6 margin.
Czech rowing took a half-final success in the morning's schedule in Rio: the skater, Ondřej Synek, won his semi-final with an overview, beating second-placed Damiro Martin from Croatia by almost a second despite the slow-morning in the end.
Good today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as I could, Sonny said.
It was his opponents, unlike him, that had to fight for advancement.
So it took some away from them, that would make it easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it will be easy, it's just playing into my hands, said the rower of the Prague Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková, however, did not in her footsteps in Snyka's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower placed fourth in today's semi-final in her run and will start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place in the first place on Saturday.
Gold from London is not so defended.
I didn't make the final at the Olympics for the first time.
I'm a little bit sorry, but on the other hand I did a quality race and I gave it everything I could.
The opponents were simply better, with Topinkova Knapková bowing down.
She fought to the end and believed she would make it to the top six at her fourth games.
She gave up the fight just before the finish.
I knew the girls were even, that anyone could advance from that field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman for having such a finish.
And I thought I could advance to the final through the Austrian.
Unfortunately, she rode her life's race today, she said the 2011 world champion.
Far beyond the final gates in Rio, young shooter Filip Nepejchal remained, who failed to make his way out of qualifying for the second time, this time the caliber-deters lying.
In it, Nepejchal took 33rd place.
Qualifying was best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky advanced from the top with 629 points, second to Kirill Grigoryjan (628.9).
The Neppejchal shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke in the Rio programme for the first time, among them Czech seven-time players Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cach is ranked 11th after the second event of the Olympic competition, the Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is 22nd.
It is led by Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimetres, as did the second Belgian, Nafissatou Thiam, in the run.
Both took care of the historically best high-altitude performance in the seven-race.
They tried to jump in 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Aside from the absurdity of the question thus asked: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, whereas Russia's did not.
There were dictators in the two great Eurasian nations in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed largely to the 94 million victims of communism, which is presented by the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis wiped out around 6 million Jews in inhumane fashion, and the total victims of World War II were estimated at 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities.
In Germany or the USSR, not only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, either actively, passively or just by cowardice or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not the specifics of these peoples alone, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, the imminent end of the war came the denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: Daddy, Grandfather, why did you attend such atrocities?
How could you do that!
This has brought real reflection and the healing of society.
Until recently, German elites cared mainly about the country's prosperity, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly don't want to be connected back by Alsace-Lorraine or someone - to revanch - to invade - perhaps anyone will recognize it.
After the lost Cold War in Russia, there was no major reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was finally closed at the turn of the millennium when a former KGB (sic!)Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is the revanche, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and the future of their own people are no value to the faithful.
Bit theirs, and they will be afraid of strangers.
I still believe that this is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - predestined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from the rise in tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation has deteriorated at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region.
Who benefits from the growth of tension?
After a prolonged period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia were again in a further deterioration.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from the two opposing parties contradict each other and it is difficult to verify them independently, so do we just have the opportunity to think about the old familiar question to whom it is good for?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which Ukraine understandably rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of Ukrainian Special Forces members on the territory of Russia came from the known response from the pilot Savchenko's case that they were allegedly abducted on the territory of Russia.
If we were to accept the Ukrainian version, in what way would Russia benefit from a deterioration in the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only be damaged by Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and the intensification of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, there has been a retreat of attention from the situation in Ukraine against the backdrop of the immigration crisis in Europe.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost credit to its residents, with the current support of President Poroshenko hovering around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have been bankrupt long ago if it were not for the EU's generous financial injections and, most importantly, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to clamberfully draw attention to its country again in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its own country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to prove themselves to be strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia as well.
It is to be hoped that all those who are attempting to start an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will ultimately realize their enormous responsibility for the lives not only of the soldiers, but of all ordinary people on both rival parties and to stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria reported inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest in several years (as of June 20122) and the first non-flammable value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, as measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12-month period (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% as of June 2016, i.e. 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -0.2% as of July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 a rise in the travel of the following groups of consumer goods was recorded: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transport (1,8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, remained at the same level.
The US Secret Service is said to have been following the hacking attacks of the Russians for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks became public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was investigating an attack on the servers of the party's headquarters of the Democrats.
However, there is no official report mentioning Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied involvement in the attack.
The news of the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was top secret because its disclosure would reveal that the US Secret Service is monitoring the hacking attack and the way they do it and what sources they use could be detected.
The offensive action is said to have involved two Russian intelligence services.
New Advisory Council for Cybersecurity
The material on the Russian trail was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public figures, only a small group of eight Congressional leaders were informed, called the US gang eight.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democratic leaders in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry Reid, and four members of the congressional conscription and security committees.
The incumbent Democratic Party leader, Donna Brazile, announced on Thursday that she was creating a cybersecurity advisory board to "protect future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of Democratic Party servers."
The smoked salmon of Albert was a dangerous parasite.
The chain apologized.
Based on the consumer's suggestion of health problems after eating food Salmon wild smoked - bits 100g, expiration date 22.11.2016, the Prague health inspects performed an inspection at the Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and the Můstek.
The inspection found that batch L23012562/T4 with a consumption date 22.11.2016, which was pointed out by the customer, is no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the expiration date of 11.12.2016.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
This is a danger to humans - the larvae in the body cavity or the muscleman of the fish are a strong allergen and human-granged living larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Šticha said.
We are very sorry to customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the batch from sale and, as a precaution, we withdrew all other batches of this item.
The misconduct occurred on the part of the supplier we are in talks with and at the same time we have had this product tested ourselves, Alberta spokesperson Barbora Vanko told News.
If the customer bought this product, they can return it at any of the chain's stores and get their money back.
The larvae will be destroyed by frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vrňata.
The occurrence of the dangerous product was reported by the hygienists to the Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration.
According to the server, the free-freepotpotin.cz people after ingainment of the parasite can get sick with anisakiosis, which manifests itself in violent abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can be done asymptomatically, ČTK reported.
The symptoms will be attended for an hour to two weeks after eating an insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
Three weeks after the start of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously abandons the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to both higher and low temperatures, so they are killed with either sufficiently heat treatment of fish meat or a freeze.
Veterinarians have also currently checked the salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had the parasite in them.
The shipment with 1700 products came to the Czech Republic in early April, according to the State Veterinary Administration (JRC).
It has been shipped out, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, to date 919 packs.
The product's unsold stock is currently being withdrawn from stores, SVS spokesperson Petr Pejchal told the Czech Press Agency on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately banned the sending of other products from the warehouse after the discovery of the positive samples.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to flee Raqqa, killed by what appears to be a Russian air raid.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to the jihadist who was soon killed, he came to sober up.
The expected paradise of the caliphate was transformed for British girls into hell on earth from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister, Halima, according to relatives.
She made repeated calls to Britain and confided in her wanting to go back home.
Leising the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot indiscriminately, The Telegraph quotes the lawyer for the late girl's family, Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks led to Raqqa, from there the girl heard from for the last time.
Then came the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in east London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house she was in was flattled in May to the ground of the raid, the British ITV News reported.
The network added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that was attacking an IS stronghold in Syria.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the perilous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family's lawyer.
In the week (Kadiza) thinking about fleeing Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, she was publicly being bite to death.
I think she interpreted it (Kadiza) as a warning and decided not to take risks, she means, according to the BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set to travel on February 17 last year.
At home, all they said was that they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there through Turkey to IS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything in her power to get Kadiza back.
You'd take the blue from the sky just to get your baby out of the danger zone and this family did all the best they could, they've tensed to get your daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he says, is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent to other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many instances of people going there, realizing how things were going there, they understood how different it was from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and they wanted to return," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But as they have also gone silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To the prison for the money.
In Scotland, you can go to the bars without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the community of Inveraray was the county centre and the seat of the Duke of Argyl.
Since the mid-18th century, courts have been held at the town hall, and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts dwled in were pathetic and many prisoners attempted to flee.
A lot of them and successfully.
That is why the city's representatives decided to move the premises of the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
Either way, it was not in operation for a long time, its closure was already closed in late August 1889, as smaller correctional facilities were costly for operation and not paying much.
The story of the convicts and the hunt for the ghosts.
The prison opened to the public for a century later, with visitors able to compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed.
The guides in period costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also an amicable room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be confined to one of the cells, mostly for a souvenir photograph, or to create a feeling that the prisoners are experiencing behind bars.
In addition, the Inveraray prison is one of Scotland's most famous sites, where it is allegedly haunted.
Several groups of paranormal hunters have already set out there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some spirits.
Such a night, however, will cost £300, which translates into roughly £9,500.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the villages are also attracted to great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
'Animé' effect on Snapchat is criticised as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by the animes, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, the Snapchat app allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identities in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that seems to have stepped out of Roy Lichtenstein's image.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any error will be made immediately public.
Snapchat filters have received criticism in the past, accusing the app of promoting blackfacing or supporting white shades of skin as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users a filter this week that gave users their angled eyes, their teeth twisted and inflated faces, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellowface."
And they asked whether these repeated contentious issues were pointed to a larger problem in society - the diversity problem.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the novelty and indignation quickly spread, and Snapchat said the next day that he had rescinded the job.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of the bills to the characters of the animated, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to the observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded the painful stereotypes of action.
The others, without wrapping, rejected the comparison with the animators.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was "at least, harmful and embarrassing."
She added that she "it is difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is dragged to the contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has exceeded these cultural limits.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the seating in the corporations to Holywood, and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - may mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
"When one Snapchat filter creates a picture that is offensive to some users," the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, "it's just very hard to go unnoticed today, as it used to be."
Katie Zhu, the product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in an interview over the phone, she said she believed that racially motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white, totally male management, and ended the article with the hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they don't have any diversity among the employees, and colorful people at the moment these things are decided," said Zhu, who has a Sino-American ancestry, "or that's where the colored people work, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to speak."
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not disclose the numbers on the diversity of its employees, with the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently adopted a recruitment worker who should focus on the under-represented population and internal management of inclusion.
Zhuová adds: "I wonder if they really need more such users who can say that it is not okay," with the fact that their account will remain cancelled.
Army officers distorted intelligence information about IS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report issued Thursday that officers from the central headquarters of the United States were changing intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and in Syria than the events provided from the country.
According to a preliminary report by the Task Force Task, compiled by the Republican chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Sub-committee, "sace of dissatisfaction" among Central Intelligence Agency analysts was found to have been identified, according to which their superiors changed their assessments of U.S. efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as the CentCom, is the military central in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release on the report reads: "The outlets of the intelligence services approved by Centcom's senior officers usually offered a more positive picture of US counterterrorism efforts than those confirmed by the facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than those obtained from other parts of the intelligence community."
"What happened on the Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are hurt when a flawed analysis is presented to senior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of Centcom's leadership to reach the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing American efforts to train the Iranian forces in the 2014 and 2015.
While there is no decisive evidence that the Obama administration's top officials have ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that the analysts were under the impression that they were under pressure from the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, there were many press releases from the Central Staff, the statements and congressional statements considerably more positive than the events actually were," the report reads.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is very clear after months of investigation," Representative Mike Pompeo, the Republican representative from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014, to mid-2015, the highest-ranking intelligence personnel of the US central staff of the Central Intelligence Service manipulated the output of the staff's intelligence services in order to downplay the IS's dangers in Iraq.
Republicans formed a task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence information related to the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report released on Thursday must be followed by further investigation further investigation.
There is still another investigation in the Centcom's intelligence services, led by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the Republicans' working group's conclusions.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling the evaluation of information on IS and the security forces of the Iraqi security forces," said Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Committee and the representative of the Democrats, in a statement.
In Adam Schiff's words, the process "lead has led to the outcry of intelligence," it damaged morale among analysts, and "insufficiently took dissenting views into account."
However, Schiff and the Democrats argue that they have found no evidence that the White House is attempting to press Centcom analysts to adjust their findings to "a draft or political situation."
Preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were released in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon inspector general's investigation, which was opened following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Ministry would not comment on the parliamentary report as the Inspector General's investigation is still ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a sound dialogue on these crucial national security issues."
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the bombing of the Iraq and Syria bombing is successful for the US (a statement that now declares an increasing number of defense officials).
However, last year's accusations have raised question marks about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to frankly evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis sites.
Criticism of the coverage of the Islamic State has been a backhea of conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research work stating that President George W. Bush's administration - despite many analysts' objections - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to contemplating what would be followed by the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in opposing the Islamic State's intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that the Hooker team had concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, air strikes against Islamic State refineries had not significantly weakened the financial resources of the terrorist group, as the group had built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been made outside the central staff.
The commander of the Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to the criticism of the past year after many legislators found the testimony of the Senate to be too positive for the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Centcom.
The U.S. won the field hockey game for the fourth game in a row, so the deciding game will be played today in the UK team
Katie Bam scored three goals in the match against Japan, which ended in a 6-1 victory, and scored the first two goals of the game just a day later for the American women's team in play, beating India 3-0.
Five goals in two matches is a memorable achievement, but Bamova (27) said she was not sure if she ever did such a thing.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those who write their goalposts.
But this is what he knows: The American is leading the tournament 4-0 at the Olympic Games and shares the top spot in the group with the UK, which remained unbeaten on Thursday after Japan's 2-0 defeat.
The UK and the United States will face the final match of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will determine who from the group of six teams will finish in first place and who will finish in second place.
The first-place team will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the top of the second group, a little longer.
However Saturday's game ends, the Americans caused a stir here with their surprise ride, four years after finishing between the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a hockey stick for field hockey when she was 3 years old (her older sisters played in Drexelu) and entered the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
The 2008 Olympics eluded her because she did not make it to the final roster.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team were doing so well.
The next year, England's Craig Parnham was appointed as coach and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the pace of work in London as we have today.
We made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam began in the first half by scoring a goal with a bekenda from close range.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the scoreboard 1-0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took the opportunity.
She escaped down the left side of the field, then slipped through to the centre and scored the ball in the goal to take the American 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goaltender, Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three victories, was the first ever tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic rampag
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - is the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, there is a sense of persistent, indescribable and biased alternating of competition and effort.
It is how the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay pike handed over from the chamanelon to a swimmer, a gymnast and a triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspapers, or listen to your neighbor's interview in the café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with the soles in his face, is at the Olympics for the first time, and could also be among those whose names will be heard in prime-time homes between advertising and spots of sponsors if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley (28) of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in the trampoline jumping.
The Olympic Fire doesn't shining at all competitions the same way.
Farther from the center, a little in the shadows are sports that aren't universally recognized: air-gun fire, bow gunshotguns, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw my attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampolines.
Although the jumps on the trampoline have been an Olympic sport since they were first shown at the Sydney Games in 2000, the sport remains almost unnoticed after 16 years of interventions - many of the people I have questioned have not even known that it is an Olympic sport.
It may be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012, none of the athletes made it to the finals.
The men's category awards are usually shared between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be huging Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada.
But jumps on the trampoline have yet to be unlucky, partly because the uninitiated's ear will be more likely to be suited to a clown's university than to the Olympics.
I must confess that I am not an expert, but merely an enthusiast watching from the country.
It has a comic potential - a comic-book vibration of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampolín" which means "jumper's plate."
The inspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of up to almost 10 meters and perform kits with several elements (salta, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are evaluated according to the implementation, difficulty and "air-air-to-air."
In Rio, there will be a competition of 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
The gold medal fighters must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
It seeks to catch up with not only the finish line or the starting wall, but, as television news reports, another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous endeavor is classy, admirable, a little fanatical - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's also a bit exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline brings relief in this respect.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she bounces as if they were in a state of weight-free weight like astronauts, flying up, then down, then back to effortlessly up again.
Without competition and, of course, difficulty, it is impossible, but for the duration of the assembly there is no furious struggle to achieve the goal, no distance awards, but only a perfect, graceful spring of time and gravity.
This is the closest one, when the Olympics and zen will come closer.
The qualification and final of the women takes place on Friday afternoon, at 1 p.m. Eastern time, and the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the afternoon block, which starts both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise peaceful, pleasant moments that you will probably miss through the other fights.
And if the only way to get attention is to be achieved by male athletes being the subject of in-lovery sights and materialization - as the US Gymnastics recently proposed, according to the Wall Street Journal - then Logan Dooley is merely waiting for his new fans to gasp.
"Protesting Generations" in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during the clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
Over the past months, however, the country has been engulfed in anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses say officers shot dead and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
The circulating videos of the protests, which are believed to come from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, are captured by members of the security forces beating young people with his sticks after being forced to stand against the wall on the hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project's head for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to remove the danger of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few of African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy was at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
But Ethiopia is hard to call a model for democracy - the human rights organization talks unstellion about government repression - the country's opposition has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many have been expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But that may change.
"When you're choking people and they have no choice but to protest, there's a break," said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He protests all the youth.
A whole generation is protesting.
There are many complaints, and they relate to everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's election, which was widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, pressure is mounting at the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this inaccurately marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anyliters fear that the separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past few years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use the turmoil to rearm.
There are several factors explaining why, after years of shining beneath the surface, these bitter sensations have flare up again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks for the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And while the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case primarily during protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they were gathering for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromy and the Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and the Amhhra are not natural allies.
For the long ages, the Amhhur, largely from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, excel at politics and commerce, using the Oromy, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are on our way to a unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, the Oromo leader.
The biggest protests were in the areas inhabited by Amhary and Oroma.
Many Amhhari and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigrai, which make up around 6 percent of the population and dominate the military, intelligence services, trade and policy.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012 when he succumbed to an unchanched out disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterfully able to uncover the initial signals of discontent and used ambassadors to process the opponents and get him on the side.
"The current regime lacks basic knowledge," Abdi, an analyst at the conflict, said.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative unfamiliarity to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigrai region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the Tigrejci-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be a further shed for the blood.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005 after thousands of people protesting what analysts described as an election that the government screwed up and then stolen.
This was followed by a crackdown, during which many protesters were killed - though less than in the past few months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual rise in controversy within the Ethiopian government has not been stopped by this.
And there is dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amglando city of Gondar attacked Tigrejci-owned business firms, and a grate against Tigrejei on social networks became more common.
Analysts say the protests are putting the US and other Western allies in the uncomfortable situation.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to promote democracy, it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile area.
"That," Abdi said, "is a very sharp edge of bingle."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as "sarkasm"
Donald J. Trump attempted to downplay the latest controversy flooding his campaign on Friday by saying he didn't mean it, when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential nominee's ability to speak clearly to the US public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward position, who have resisted him in the tumultuous times and must explain that he may not have been serious about his comments.
After this motion at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he had indeed not intended to say that the president and H. Clinton had created IS.
However, in a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he was merely sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of a claim just one day ago, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio anchor Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump's rem remark by commemorating Obama's efforts to destroy IS, the Republican nominee did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes when Trump attempted to focus his campaign's attention on the economy, while his preference in the polls is falling.
Trump and Clinton participated in a duel in Michigan this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to revisit the issue.
He warned on Twitter again that Clinton's proposals were linked to a tax increase, and said that he thought her speech was boring.
Trump has used the defense with sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he drew a wave of criticism when he came forward with a suggestion that the Russians should go through to Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remark, by saying, "I'm sarcastic, of course."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and temper them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing the extent to which some reports are echoed by his supporters to find out how they react, and then, according to the reaction, "referen an explanation" in one way or another," said Ruth Sherman, the communications specialist who followed the language the two candidates used.
But I also think he is dexterous in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be able to explain them in different ways.
As the poll results in his favor continue to decline, Trump has adopted an even more sordid tone in recent days, rather than teasing things for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, published Friday, showed that Tump is well behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very close behind in Florida.
Trump is even attempting to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he calls, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpretting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump facing increased attention in the closing months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have put Trump's jokes in the awkward position of his devoted followers, who must stand for him publicly, however provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he wrongly called a newcomer, and this was because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are attempting to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, has allowed IS to be rampant and unable to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Ahead of Friday's rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to crone a fire around him on Twitter for mournging and biased to his every word.
He laughed at the "all-eight, pathetic" TV scholars who are trying to understand him and said, "They can't do it!"
Several Democrats have grinned the apology to Trump, saying it is just another piece of evidence that he is not eligible for the presidency.
The café has been pushed out of the market by prices. It is now returning in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where the coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, it was forced out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a shop replaced by Verb in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake soaps.
The locals moutled it as the last loss of the growing city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: 'New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, hotel Chelsea was out-racked and the Verb store is now a soap.'
But if New York is a change, it's also rediscover.
The Resurrested Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbo is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café who is also the owner and managing director of the new post.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to the new job, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same baking supplier and bought the same model of the espresso machine.
He even used the lighting from the old Verbo again.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu includes ham, egg and cheese sandwiches, and toppings such as capers and fried onions.
You'll also find bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer brews beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of the original regulars.
"A number of original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg for the prices," he said.
Last Sunday, one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveira, was here.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to the Verb Cafe often.
She even came after the café moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found that what I love was the coffee and culture in the Verbo," she said.
Now he drinks coffee again, but on that day she gave herself a mixed chai instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been a devoted departure for the Verb since 2003.
He comes before work and orders the same thing.
"At quarter and eight, every day, like a watch, I come here and they're already preparing my bun with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but occasionally he lets bacon, eggs and ham put on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry for the soap deal to take his old place.
The truth is that the Soap Cherie owners offered to make special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the café as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also received the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to display it soon to make his new neighbours feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juicle maker wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility for the café to be extended to the neighbouring building.
It is enough for many customers to get their old favourite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he said, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe reopened, to enter and have a coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressing food from the time of the crisis - in the "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office as president in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and was having lunch.
The Labuic President Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from 5 Avenay, such as the pâté of the goose jatýrek and the Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: a diabolical-style egg in a paradise sauce of rascal, a potato puree, and a plum pudding for dessert.
"It was an act of cookery solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane, in her book "97 Orchard," tells the life story of a residential building on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal," which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed their cooking solidarity and and a reporter gathered for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Shop, a small austere buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the crisis.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, and Andrew (57) had a turkey, a potato mash and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was well suited to talking about food during the crisis.
"The Crabans were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
It was sold with peanuts, liver and bean meatballs.
They were made from that admixture and other cheap food that set the ingredient.
Transfer a number of peanuts you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grimaced.
"They'd lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet to eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served freshly baked cake.
It was the Americans who sent food to the starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" follows the ways in which the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abomin.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as feared was the new budget diet: The mysterious foods were expanded, such as meatballs and dish of casters, the casteras as a "amazing way to use the remains," Ziegelman noted, as the chefs could hide the non-aesthetic ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat - the central point of American food for a long years - has become an economical-elocated luxury.
The strange mixtures that were to serve as a caloric and nutritional filler preferred to taste or even common sense in cooking.
During the book exploration, which contains the recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period meal of baked onions filled with peanuts.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized, "It was surreal."
Peanut butter with roasted onions doesn't go together.
It was typical of a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, the domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the shtick of the federal office for the domestic economy from 1923 to 1943 - directed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take the reins of the budget, and the goats, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, turned into tasty meals.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
In particular, dessertes arose in the government's response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's pose "I'll eat a pie."
While publicly praising the simple iowa farmer's cuisine of his childhood, he doused as the chosen millionaire he had become.
"He was al-like meal of continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He ate in a nearly gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not prompted him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in the taste. This led to the White House being "not just served the most dustiest meal in all of Washington, but also in the most disheavaged manner."
A number of crisis-time eating habits subsheled as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The reference remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple says they understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman's mother better during the book's writing - perhaps why she couldn't throw out the food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She made the feeling sick of her."
There was an accident with wreaths.
When Eisenberg's clean tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give the modest recipes to elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly dunked a spoon into the thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was wrong.
Andrew added Coe, and then again.
And, like a good farmer, he told his wife, "It would be a little chopped-in walnut."
Europeans: Migrants are going for benefits.
Most of the refugees who are pouring into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the shows would look like if we made them.
A group of Russian artists calling itself 2D Among Us make fun of their native country.

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the legal representation cost in the case of the C jaundice patent against Merck
The district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbursement of the lawyers' fees incurred by it in the process of patenting C against the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a conviction was overturned in June to pay Gilead for damages for breach of two Merck patents in connection with the highly successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge had repeatedly found illegal conduct on the part of Merck, among other things, a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Justice Beth Labson Freeman said in the file on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to waive the fees that arose in connection with the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for new-generation anti-lipoon C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other to claim to each other that they were the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead's drugs.
US-backed military forces claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed military forces gained full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the border with Turkey, after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now being seized by the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The troops liberated over 2,000 civilians who were being held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Managozh Military Council, told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid the federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which states that the Democrat presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue in that year and paid a real 34.2 percent tax.
The Clintons donated $1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed a nearly $5.3 million lecture fee to the joint coffers, and the former secretary of state granted a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster for her book on his time at the State Department.
The Clinton co-candidate, US Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, has released 10 years' tax returns.
They paid a real tax of 20.3 percent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency," Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign, said in a statement.
Against this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose it on them.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers, cited the audit of the IRS Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to disclose the tax returns.
"Your move," campaign aide to Hillary Clinton said on Twitter, following on the Democratic nominee's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special Trump adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax returns until the audits were completed.
According to Trump's critics, who include 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republican party members, they agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profits, charity fees, business transaction posts, and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is strongly speaking on the issue, posting a video on Friday in which she recalls how high-ranking republicanized republications are urging Trump to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, in your speech on economic issues in Michigan, I will.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates for the presidency have done for decades - to publish their tax returns," she said to the people.
Politico reported that Trump has paid no or very low taxes in the past two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times columnist has quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim, as may be the case today.
Federal tax sealas have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett to ensure that all those who make more than $1 million in a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaze, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he had also undergone an IRS audit, and that Trump was "not "why" for the IRS, but for voters.
Clinton's campaign was released by tax returns retrospectively until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid a federal tax of an average of 32 percent and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between the ages of 2007 and 2014.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, their wages are only $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund from which the Clintons listed income in dividends and interest rates of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going to people's homes - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder.
This practice has worked, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, is promoting this process and training volunteers in the villages of the north of Tanzania, how to use this nonviolent advance in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming the animals.
Many of them used spears to their defense.
Friday is the World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since they developed them this ... set of tools, we've noted a change in the behavior of these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them," Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second steps is to shine a flashlight on the passing elephant and lower the horn.
If this does not deter him, it will be for the ejection of the so-called "chickel of chilli."
The chilli powder mixed with the salt is wrapped in a condom with the firecracker, its end knots to look out of it only by the wick.
After detonation, the condom explodes and a fine powder of chilli is scattered into the air.
Usually, one whiff is enough for the elephant to go in a different direction.
The last option is to launch a fireworks display that triggers a loud, clear explosion.
The Jewish director leaned on the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling Israel to the Arabs' "request" of the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol in Berlin did not have the code for calling to Israel, in the words of the employee's "demand" on the basis of an Arab client.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust, aired his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann attempted to find Israel in the hotel's list of the call codes.
However, the state was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 Israel was removed and deleted in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own call centre.
The director sought an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with the problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, in his words, "shotled."
The hotel staffer replied that the measure had been "dethod after considering the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this move has further irritated the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they have demanded that Israel's callcode be erased," Lanzmann quoted the employees as saying in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "great embarrassment."
The event was horrified and shocked.
In itself, it's a huge embarrassment.
The fact that this has happened in Germany, and in such a hotel chain, is an even greater shame.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event provoked a strong reaction online, with people calling it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel has simply "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
"Inmation to you," reads another post, which points out that the hotel, which is located in the classy Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any accusations by calling the event a "overlook" and "re-refusing" to Lanzman.
"No direct order has been issued" not to include Israel in the list of call codes, quotes Suddeutsche Zeitung as a representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
The clash between students and police took place in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement agencies tried to disperse the students, which ended with the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the governor of Sano, Governor Gerald Alckmin, aim to save money is also the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators could be seen spray-paining signs against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
The latest protest comes only days after the demonstrators took to the streets en masse in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country's senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Le Leban Dzhagaryan, trade turnover rose by 70.9 percent year-on-year in the year-on-year comparison between Moscow and Tehran.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the top priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran grew by 70.9 percent compared to the same period for 2015 and to $856 million.
Specifically, Russia's exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to the sum of $158 million.
The jump in trade was provided by supplies of machinery, land-based vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
The Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to be visited by a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran has issued around 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly travel.
In addition, Iran made it to the top 20 countries for the first time, according to the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be surpassed," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes to see a change here.
"Personally, I can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the relics of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
Callum Skinner's Scotland rushing home after Brits won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome when the VB trio defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was in the brake he took for his Scotsman, Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man was delighted by the legend when he rushed to the finish and stole the victory from the hands of the favoured New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the world championship in track cycling in March, although Hoy had ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a replacement for specialist opener Jamie Staff.
So the Hindes appeared just in time.
After the departure of Hoye, a vacancy was also vacant, which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to fill.
Skinner was the man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who, along with Hoyo, was the champion four years ago - and Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but took the leotard in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
The Hindes were slightly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change in strategy was a large part of the transformation, with Hindes going to a higher gearbox to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes took to the podium, he kept his eyes on them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of my own and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and we beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There's no better way to win this.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell to the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew the remark, and Britain's rivals had no way to appeal.
This time around this victory there was no such problem.
The Hindes said, "With all the British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London."
In the last three months, we've all come together as a team.
We've lost in a lot of world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for the nation, which has won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a successful five days will be waiting for us at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny showed, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time at one Olympics.
This would then be his birthday for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, it is also her birthday on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, with Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also celebrating her birthday) on this day - marked a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Still, how much did Hoy get.
Next up, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will last for the next three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm enjoying this one.
The team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell you the truth, winning for myself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
That was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the team pursuit at the four-kilometer team.
They ended up with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (22:42) are held in today's second day of the race, which will surely be the focus of Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualifying race, he debated with the commissioners when the judges called for a height to be measured.
In a similar women's race, which continues and finishes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on their strong track cycling team and dominated the mid-range of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After really exceptional performances, demonstrating the absolute superiority in Beijing and London, it has diminised its expectations in the run-up to Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the velodrome races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver a top performance with perfect timing could be confirmed again.
Uncertain future of the Tavier in Portland after the termination of the energy supply contract
The future of Portland's aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the company with electricity and which informed the electricity supply contract of one of the owners of the smoky.
This step is being taken after the government of Victoria earlier this year decided not to extend the provision of the subsidies that the business keeps going.
The fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Alcoa Portland can be at risk for up to 2,000 jobs.
When it is closed, up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk.
And because the meltdown consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, more avalanche impacts can occur.
Alcoa closed the Taven Point Henry in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglese power plant last year.
Alcoa's tavire at the company in Portland is pro-profit and is in danger of being closed.
The move follows several years of speculation about the future of the business, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and, more recently, over plant production prices.
The AGL, which supplies electricity to the large melting aluminium with electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley Valley, said it expected that one of the other three owners would also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with the Chinese company CITIC and Marubeni Corp from Japan's retail shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to work, in other words, that the off-squire demand for electricity from the taviery will continue," she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were so-called "surance contracts" that were to come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will actually expire in 2017.
"AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017," the plant said.
Furthermore, any possible impact on the AGL's profits since the 2018 fiscal year is limited due to the strong outlook for the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already drawn up the value of the contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million ‘in the event that the termination would occur.’
Alcoa stated that the contract's decision to terminate "it has an impact on its ... capacity to operate a friather or to secure electricity supply to the meltdown plant."
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 to start in November of this year, although it still had to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland Tavern in Victoria as well as the Tomago near Newcastle as a result of a weak economy in the sector.
The head of operation of the AGL, Stehpen Mikkelsen, who approached analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of these firms were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand in the [electric energy] market.
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian TV TV show - now it's the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner's mother-managent, appeared on the cover of the September edition of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the brand's ambassador for Estee Lauder, who was showing off at Fashion Week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, looking at this front page, Kendall wants to cry."
The revelation of the front page was followed by the bizarre (or simply the continuation of the Kardashian's?) video, which featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bark rioters Rob and Caitly, and along with all the popular showbiz uncle, keep Up producer Ryan Seacrest). They forgot about their sisters' cover, just to end in a classic turn: they're setting up a secret party.
It's a by-clutter line of almost every "birthday" episode of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we'd forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on the eighth-hour morning show), but Kris somehow needed to make sure the other girls could get sick of this publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue, we've definitely entered the new era of the Kardashian.
The older sister, Kim, may have pushed Kendall to the cover of Vogue (she was co-wrong with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the magazine's September issue is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling figure of the year.
The release, which in its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that of the 832 pages in last year's edition, 615 pages with advertising content were).
The unveiling of the star, which will appear on the front page, is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that the magazine's pictures have leaked in the past two years before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, the front page has certainly featured more "celebrities that make models" than "the tunics that are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar winner and Dior ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, and Laga Gaga was honoured a year later.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall - described by the magazine as the "moron model" of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not related to well-known people, nor of the stars of real estate shows, or the children of today who know how to make a well-scheden video (althy when Jenner presents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel at the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover page last year, had one of the most powerful years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in a reality show.
In June, Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, and called them "the girls of the moment."
These feelings flare up again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September's Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
He's doing the show for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make up by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own paywalds.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, she performs on a reality show, perhaps only as one way to see Kourtney and her children.
Community legal aid centres reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in the community's legal aid centres, and they are poised for the effects in the sector itself that will have to further limit funding for the already overloaded services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, at-risk workers, victims of violence and people without funding to fight an unjust eviction and the like - are already being rejected when they are looking for free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already strained to the brim, are about to make further cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of the community's legal assistance centres in Queenslad, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, five thousand people were found to be rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without the federal government's decision to be overt be lifted, the situation would be getting worse.
"Communal legal centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being refused the vital services they need," he said.
People who have escaped from relations with the rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families passing through the demolition, workers who are unjustly dismissed - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to the next thousands of Queensland people at risk having to navigate the complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Attorney General and the Queensland Senator George Brandis to prevent this shortening of funds immediately to get people the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government of the state has honoured its commitment to secure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community's legal aid centres and the communities of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after a staff member allegedly pointed a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged inaction after being told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February aimed the director of operations at a crew member while riding a jeep.
The incident was described in a court case file handed to Vincent Bordini, a former campaign campaign tutor in the state in the state on Wednesday.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that "it will not happen."
Director Earl Phillip "drinted at the gun with his fingers, put his right index finger at the trigger, and pointed the barrel at Vincent's line of nose," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini, following a complaint to the campaign's local and regional leadership, found that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
"The weapons do not have to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused an uproar when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and gun owners (which is regulated in the US in the Second Amendment of the Constitution) could be taken in if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was elected and could appoint her judges.
Trump's campaign says the media took his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate the violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini is seeking compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, the unlawful use of violence and the cause of emotional harm.
Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not respond to the report for comment immediately.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news bulletin in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one responded to his consultancy Innovative Consulting Services in a short time.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand the Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, the Heathrow is in a tremendous way attractive, just as London 2012 was when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all our peoples and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games were of huge benefits for both Startford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching places, 40,000 new jobs and end the youth unemployment around the airport.
As before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who will think that Heathrow's enlargement is too great.
I have been told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we will be ridiculed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, the Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and businesses, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, to leave the heritage in the form of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that, in term and with a budget set, introduced an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme, starting with the T5 terminal - which was voted the best terminal in the world for five years in a row, after the T2 Terminals, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
They are now ready to deliver the third runway, which is backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London Games in 2012 were a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that the Heathrow's expansion will be so too.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, to secure trading for the future, and to leave the skills and employment legacies that Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game of cat and mouse in the blocking of ads
The attempts to bypass advertising-blocking programs have become a game of cat and mouse for companies that make money from online marketing. At least that's what one of the companies that program such software says.
On Thursday, that is, only two days after Facebook announced that it would be blocking advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users could update the filters in their program and re-druct advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around ads to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
Adblock, however, now claims that they have already bypassed the new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that "this kind of war between the open source community of blocking ads and those who try to bypass them has been insisting since the blocking of the ads was invented," and that Facebook is likely to come up with another repair of its own.
The fact that the company owning the world's largest social network was involved in the war only proves just the big problem with blocking ads for industry.
According to the study, Tkerou conducted by Pagefair and Adobe used advertising filters worldwide worldwide - almost four times what was the case in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of advertising profits on Facebook, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesman said the company, however, was going against advertising filters on desktops, because the mobile advertising filters for mobile apps for the social network and Instagram were not working.
Advertisements for desktops still represent a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it will update the "ad preferences" tool to give people the opportunity to better control how ads are displayed to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters were worrying them because they could also block content on the site that is unrelated to the ad.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, so we preferred to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
Woman hit by car of Swiss motorway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to the event in which a woman was driven over on the highway by several cars in the early hours of Thursday and was presumably attempted to commit suicide.
The accident took place on the A1 motorway near the Morges in the Vaud canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but police say they have still not all been identified. Police are urging these drivers and all the others who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, the attorney for Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to determine whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
This is what the prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person going on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the paper said.
Last year, a police officer was cleared of charges for vehicular manslaughter after hitchhunking and killing a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim, aged 22, was drinking alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving in a proportionate manner and that the presence of the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should come forward to the police on the phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (ACCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
On Friday, the AČCKA's Executive Director Kateřina Petříčková said.
The sixth annual Prague Pride began on 8 August, bringing the life of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) to the festival.
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for the high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized enterprises," Petříčková said.
According to a survey by organizers, foreign festival-goers spend an average of CZK 3100 per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bar, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, etc.
"For tourism in general, LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in stays in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
The festival's programme also features the first Pride Tourism Symposium.
It is lested by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, 14 August.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival on Saturday will be the traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letna.
The parade, which has been attended by thousands of people in recent years, will this year observe a minute's silence in the memory of the victims of the June nightclub attack in Orlando, where the assailant shot dead 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate forty years.
The undersally hut-millers Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have entertained small and large viewers for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series, director Lubomír Beneš, premiered on 12 August 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries around the world, were cartoons of the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, which he invented for a magazine with two hilarians of Mr Ouholíček and Mr. Sedlec.
Beneš then invited dramaturge Jiří Kubíček and artist Vladimír Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Kuťáci.
Today's likeness with a yellow and red trick and a radial was given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began to be created in Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the houtled villain in 1985, this time it was already shot directly for Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of the animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other episodes were created.
After his death in 1995, more episodes continued with other creators, many of whom were co-won by Benes's son Marek.
There are now over ninety episodes with stories of these huths that are sprinkled under the hands of all, but never get angry and are always full of optimism, ideas and hilarian enthusiasm, and are finally satisfied with their work, which is evidenced by the famous gesture "...and it is!"
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs, and to the theatres, and the characters, or other toys with the depiction of Pat and Mata, are a hit for any toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji as well as for two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the wake of fairy tales, we have chosen one sporting and one of your lives.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved a historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
The two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what are the most people spend on at airports?
That's Friday's review from the world's websites.
First Olympic medal.
The historic success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the United Kingdom team in the final of the Olympic Rugby Rugby tournament.
It is the first ever medal to win for Fiji at the Olympics.
Waiting to win the first valuable metal took sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympic Games was sent.
Much of the credit for the success goes to coach Fiji.
But it is ironic that he is the Brit Ben Ryan.
He has led the team since 2013, and after the final as a British citizen, he could be happy, unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually dominated him, and the small state of 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The news was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without arms and legs since 11 months.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her hands and legs of the doll and then sit together without prosthetic legs.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year of life, with doctors giving it only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He has a perspective.
I've seen her present herself with other children with the words Hello, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands, my mother added.
Look at the joy the doll has attraed.
We spend the most at the airport on?
CNN provides a finding that people at airports spends the most on bottled water.
The Hudson's travel travel essential stores chain has released data over the past year, summing up 10 products that customers buy most often in their stores at airports.
The water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large pack of M&M candle-limer candies.
And can you guess who closes the top ten?
You can't eat the only thing above.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: the New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines, they are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, they laughed at Murray and Bond.
Rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand have been reign in the category of de-celeas without a helmsman for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing the competition since 2009.
At the lagoon, Rodrigo de Freitas, they claimed their 69th win in a row in Thursday's final.
How are we different from the others?
We are simply prettier, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta when he was asked to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Frankly, we're not doing anything different from the others.
We just train hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost a 6-foot-tall and 100-kilky chaser, with an academically-looking Bond five centimetres shorter and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they are of a different nature.
Bond studies and is in finance, with Murray having a charity boxing match, for example.
That's why they don't spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting on the boat basically saying we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, admitted Bond, who even at the press conference demonstrated that Murray is the dominant in the crew.
He was the first to reply, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, they destroy their opponents with calm force.
They are on their pace, and while they are often not in the lead at the halfway point, the opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometre course and we never wanted to go the first kilometre to the top.
We're just trying to ride a pace that no one else can do.
We know what we have to do to win, said Murray, 34.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both members of the Golden Four were without a helmsman.
It was after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later that they decided to switch to number two without a helmsman.
At the London Olympics, they probably atone for the biggest defeat of their careers, and they also confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us to do and didn't ask questions.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it was going to be a hell of a lot of time, and we had to make sure we were mentally well off, Murray said.
We know that everyone wants to overthrow us from the throne.
The target is on our backs all the time.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to projections of NASA's new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for the Study of Space have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate study researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and siypored CO2, conditions could have prevailing similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rate of rotation of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus once could have boasted of a sparse Earth-like atmosphere, turning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
On the planet, the areas were probably drier than on Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic diversity to give life on it and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus also used the sun, which was 30 percent more muted.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, during the slow rotation, he exposes his day side to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This way the surface is heated and the formation of the rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and shield the surface from too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus, a similar evolution to which was hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Though Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and the water vapor were burned by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen leaked, leaving only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the lethal effect of the greenhouse gas -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as his post as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche team on Thursday, citing the impossibility of participating in the team's decision-making process as a reason.
Colorado's executive vice president/general manager, Joe Sakic, confirmed the move, stating that the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I've been head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
I have thought long and intensively over the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations is in line with the vision of the organisation.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team's contributions.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization and we wish him well for the future.
Roy was nominated for the win for Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to a gain of 112 points and a first-place spot in the Central Division. Colorado, however, faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and failed to make it through the season games during the last two years.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39-4 in the 2015/2016 season and were five points short of a second wildcard in the Western Conference.
Goalie Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil rig resume talks and break the strike
The leaders of the negotiating parties said the strike over wages for oil rig workers were suspended while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
The striks against the Wood Group oil field services company sporadically took place on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Trade Union Organisations Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process to address the current disagreements," the statement reads.
Starting next week, we will have a series of day-long meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to the trade unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent in protest at wage cuts.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid out about 9 percent less to its North Sea suppliers due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give companies room to cope with the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell removed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to abandon operations in the field of oil and gas as far as 10 countries to modernise its processes - immediately after the mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
A member of Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest working disagreements of the entire generation that led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, as it said, is vital to the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that operates for all, not just for some," he said in a statement.
As a comparison, in 2016, nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures star rotation rate in the Flags
The latest Kepler Space Telescope mission to assist astronomers is to get an almost complete list of star rotation from the roo coping of the pleade.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster revolt at different speeds, as well as how the turning time is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope to compare our results with other star clusters to learn more about the relationship between star material, its elldom and even history in its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research fellow at Caltech's Infred Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a new report.
The Starbuy of the Foron is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now in the state of adulthood and have been around for over 125 million years.
Now he's turning fast.
At the peak speed of rotation, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the star getting older, her turning rate slows down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by measuring the time between discovering the discovery of distinguishing points on the stars -- similar to the sun's spots.
According to the latest data on the speeds of the rotation, the larger stars rotate more slowly than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the bigger ones make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "Bralet" of the Flight, we see that the slower-woming stars are more massive, while the quickest ones are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Flob. is so close to the Fglefer, it serves as the ideal space laboratory for comparing star quality and rotation speeds.
"The drones provide an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation to both directions, both younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There's still a lot to learn about how, when, and why the stars slow down their rate of rotation and, so to speak, "scribe on their nail dance shoes."
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the speed of the Flade in three studios, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is the qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without signing up for specialisation education?
My point is that there is now a vacancy for a job in which I would like to work in, a job vacancy is only in a more distant hospital, but in about six months a space could be made available in another one where I would like to work afterwards.
So I don't know how to deal with the situation for about that six months, the question continues.

No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
The Qualification Agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and can be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the recovery of the costs incurred by increasing or deeming the employee's qualifications.
In the area of health care, there is long-term pressure to not conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the occupational mobility of healthcare professionals, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional competence and specialised competence to practise the health profession of doctor, dentists and pharmacist, it is explicitly the case that participation in specialisation education is considered to be a deepening of the qualification (not as increasing it).
This means that a qualification agreement can be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation or provide for an obligation to apply for specialisation training.
The law only lays down the conditions of an application for inclusion in the field of specialisation training.
However, the doctor is legally entitled to practise the profession of doctor by taking the necessary university studies, albeit under the conditions of the statutory prescribed conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialised capacity in the relevant field).
The law foretars a situation where professional experience completed in another field of specialisation may be included in the specialisation of the doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
In theory, it would be possible to factor the time worked elsewhere, which would be consistent with the questioner's situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it is possible to recommend consulting the relevant Department of the Ministry of Health (the Department of Science and the Medical Occupation) as the Ministry of Health provides by law the consultancy and consultation of the inclusion in and running into specialisation training.
The consultancy service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from the Syrian Halab are requesting US intervention.
The United States has not made any effort to end the siege (the rebellious parts of the city by government troops) and did not use its influence to advance the protection of civilians, AFP quoted from a letter to the White House.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support the army with the loyal president, Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab area for three hours from today to allow safe passage through humanitarian convoy to be safe passage.
From 9 a.m. to 12:00 GMT, all military activities, aerial attacks and artillery fire are to be stopped.
While the head of UN humanitarian operations, Stephen O'Brien, welcomed this, he stressed the need for at least a two-day truce.
The letter to Obama, according to AFP, was approached by 15 of the 35 doctors who work in the eastern part of Halab, which is controlled by the rebels.
It says that during the Five Years' War, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world watches and states how complex Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly discoes, said pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said that in the past month, there have been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, including 15 at the hospitals in which they work.
What we are most sad about is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
We have young children coming to the emergency room with injuries so serious that we have to choose among them the ones most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the blast cut off oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They gasped for breath, and then their lives were over - before he could begin, they reminded them.
The military loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has in recent weeks surrounded the insurers-controlled eastern part of Halab, with over 200,000 people in the inside without food supplies.
Rebels, who are under constant strikes by the Russian and Syrian Air Force, managed to break the enduity after three weeks on Saturday and launch a counter-offensive.
Both sides were then added reinforcements in and around the city.
