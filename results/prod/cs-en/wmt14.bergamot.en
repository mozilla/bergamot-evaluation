Economia and the Centre connect management.
They will offer, for example, a joint advertisement
Economia's new integrated newsroom in Karlín, Prague.
Economia took the next step to transform the Centre holding into its media house.
As of Friday, Economia and the Center have both top-level management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of the two publishing houses into a common media house," comments the changes made by Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economie and commissioned CEO Kamil Čermák.
Čermák, who will head the unified management, will be joined by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings, Andreas Demuth.
Pavel Vopařil was appointed as the new joint director of the business, to whom the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tylčerová, is also subordinate.
The new head of information technology was Stephen Burda.
The joint director of the editorial offices is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team includes the director for the transformation, Jakub Unger.
The newly established marketing director's role was commissioned by Adéla Pitts.
A separate corporate communications department is now being run by Věra Lhotská.
The joint finance director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizing structure will, among other things, enable us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the production of content of all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," Čermák added.
Economia, which is owned by the financier Zdeněk Bakala, entered into a contract to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this year.
The Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of the servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, the web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and the SMB agency Najisto, or a portfolio of other nearly two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, news server IHNED.cz, weekly weeklies Respekt and Ekonom and a number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its major titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian rockets for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base close to the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported the news.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion in the alleged missile depot, but the attack on it was not confirmed by the Israeli government.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli military, asked by CNN, declined to comment on the information about the raid.
"We do not comment on the reports of the foreign media," she said.
The target of the Israeli raid, according to a US government source, was a missile and related equipment that the Israelis believe could be transported by the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, reported that the target of an Israeli raid on a target on Syrian territory was Russian missiles SA-125.
A second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area, however, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles, according to DPA.
In addition, they said, they showed a battery of missiles SA-3s, including a command center with radar to track missile and their targets.
The missiles recorded, according to the Israeli television report, have a range of 35 kilometres and could be carried by warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed to have affected any shipment of weapons destined for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that a return was unlikely.
In a late-night interview to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since his resignation a decade after a senior position in the lead position, Mr. Blair has mostly avoided interviews about British politics, confining his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy of the Whitehall Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his reply from the London-based newspaper, the Evening Standard, quoted him as follows: "Yes, of course, but that's probably hard to see, is it, so . . ."
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport for shooting
Shots were fired at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of this, allegedly the terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, say the lawmen shot dead a rifle of an armed man.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to police, reported that there was a shootout that injured two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration.
How many people were injured in total and whether there are any victims but it is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more injuries.
Berdych and Stepanek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
For the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis players, Jaroslav Navil, nominated the four-player Tomáš Berdych, Radek Stepanek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech national team defends the trophy, but are going to play on the pitch of their opponents at the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going to the hot ground, that it's going to be wild and we have to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Stepanek, the architect of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Brno observatory takes visitors to space in new digitarium
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can sink into the new comfortable seats, and a 17-metre dome in diameter with a dome-shaped projection overhead from the American company Spitz has been added.
In the middle of the hall is the most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the hall walls.
"It is about twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Brno observatory, Jiří Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"The performance of computers is 30 to 40 times higher than that of classic personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician at the observatory.
The digitalarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body, or the bottom of the ocean.
Viewers find themselves right in the middle of a person's universe or the brain.
Another such facility is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The observatory management plans to screen purchased shows and their own productions in the hall.
There have been two shows on the agenda since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is for adults.
In it, people learn about the astronaut training, go into space, spin on centrifuza, and then see, on graphic examples, the challenging conditions the astronauts face in space.
The second show is for children and is called the Magic Cliff - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colourful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the eruption of a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitarium cost roughly fifty million crowns, which was paid for mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory from its budget also contributed smaller amounts.
The area of the design cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed up by audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory passed through two years ago.
According to director Dušek, there could still be 25 to 30,000 visitors by the end of the year.
Supreme Court upholds Obama Healthcare Act
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By a vote of 5:4, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which mandates citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, or at risk of being fined – does not contradict the Constitution on the basis of the government's tax authority.
The president of the court, John Roberts, was on the side of the four more liberal court members, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remainder of the 2700-page law and further ruled that the statutory health care requirement that mandates states to expand the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise the loss of all funding for social security insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
The action was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises to block the law.
During the Mayors in 2012, the law was strongly rejected by each of the country's leading nominee, including the presumed proposed nominee, Mitt Romney.
Nadia Konvalinková in the role of pub.
He has a new job?
Actress Nadia Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub and was very good at it.
Had the popular Czech actress planned to change the profession and go to business in the pub?
Nadia Konvalinki appeared on James Joyce's Irish pub and was shooting beer.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I was good at it.
My boss even offered to hire me and I could make a living from beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stick with what I do to this day, with acting," Konvalinková, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub's operation, revealed with a smile.
'I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey now and then,' the actress said.
Nadi's long-term friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I am dead and must not drink in my new life today.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a drink a day, and I'm trying to keep that," the actor added.
Egypt launches first freely elected president
Mohamed Morsi took the inauguration swear-off, but his triumphant day is unlikely to end the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Morsi promised "new Egypt" when he was inaugurated as the first freely elected president of the country, after Hosni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his commission before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore an oath to 18 judges clad in black gowns at a mansion built with a view of the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony a live broadcast on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old US-born engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of rapical attacks by individual governments for most of the 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small motorcade in a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time, the building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and, unlike the presidential flaunt of Mubarak's period, traffic was only briefly halted so that the motorcade could pass through the usually busy route connecting the city's center to the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, mockingly referred to as the non-charismatic "reserve tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has soared since his victory and his speech on Friday, which was aimed at presenting him not only as an Islamist candidate, but also of all those who want to bring to the end of the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state," Morsi, clad in a blue formal suit with a red tie to the judges in a wood-paneled chamber where he was sworn in.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to give his inauguration address.
As he stood at attention, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander of the field marshal Hussein Tanthai was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the chants of the "army and the people are one hand" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s it became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square on Friday, the place where the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian government last year was born, and solemnly promised to re-graplege the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council that took them over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath in court, rather than in front of parliament, as is customary, he has acquiesced to the will of the military, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Anyone who really wants to get to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the man-made center with sightseeing, churches and galleries, more than the bedekr would reveal.
Many people "read from graves."
They roam the cemeteries slowly, gaining an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what beliefs they are, how big and cohesive families they belong, at what age they die here, how important they are to their titles and professions.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they will find out how the survivors heed their dead.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was a magical one.
My sister and I could eat candy, stay up late and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a cheapskate.
For two years, there hasn't been a candy in my apartment, and this year is probably no different.
However, the statistics show that I am, in terms of Halloween, the black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), this year's most Americans will be celebrating Halloween – actually 158 million of them – and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and ornaments.
But what I look forward to every time on Halloween is trendy.
According to the NRF, $6.9 billion spent is expected to go $1.2 billion to costumes.
This year, the latest fad fashion shootout is the sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots can also be sexy.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the parade of the dead, and I bet the space men of Daft Punk will make it to our channels in Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we put our dogs in costumes and, to my astonishment, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, the Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for pets.
So there's gonna be a lot of funny dog-friendly.
As for the sweets, we don't waste any time.
According to Nielsen, the Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's roughly 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is an amazing piece of news for the 41 million trick-or-treaters who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to raid our neighborhoods.
In fact, during Halloween we buy, and believe it or not, we will consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners, nearly 16,000 tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn treats.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunting houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" "Howl-O-Scream" and "The Shock of the Shock" and "The Shock of Shock" (The Shock House).
In fact, there are officially insiders in the United States of 1,200 haunted homes that, according to the company's spooky houses, have a profit of $500 million, and this includes those amazing photos that are being hailed by fears and that your friend puts on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like takes the photo to view and comment as "you face nicely."
And finally, a little about pumpkins.
Ever since we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin), and carving a pumpkin lantern is kind of like decorating a Christmas tree - we've been doing it since we were a little kid.
Fortunately for us, the "child in pumpkin" trend started thanks to the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up on carving the gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the US Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lucer with the shimmering flame on your front porch is probably from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for anything special, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to cut up their pumpkin weighing almost one ton.
How the Investigments of Thailand lifted the sales of the Paris bar
You may be scraped over the insects, and yet you have no idea that you eat it quite voluntarily every year.
For example, grounded in the flour.
If you consciously consume it, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and the unique experience you are also taken care of.
The insect offer was the first to be placed on the menu of his establishment in Paris at the beginning of October by Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, which was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, would be found in the fashionable 18th arrondus near Montmartre by well-visited tourists.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can now only bite down on various larvae, locusts or aquatic beetles, scorphediers can also be tasted here.
Carefully and specially packed vans (so that the insects are not damaged by the wings, do not damage the legs or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron from as far away as Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it is common elsewhere.
The owner of the Paris bar with the pioneering menu lists several reasons to consume the insects.
The first is an ecological benefit, because insect production is much less costly for our planet (what is about finance, space, and water consumption) than with traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, simply aiming to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just conveying a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be excited by the idea of how they consume a beetle decorated with pesto, but the reaction of the Paris bar's customers to the serving insects, according to the owner, are very positive.
Even the skeptics are said to eventually taste it, even if they begin with the smallest bites and finally choose the scorpion.
The prices of these tasting saucers range from five to nine euros.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands CHANGED I NALADU.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were to resolve an intractable role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after the setback gave it a far more optimistic impression than the one where its participants' hands were nothed.
The group also "with washed-up hands" did better in the next test than the other.
Yet those who washed their hands, in other tests, achieved worse results than those who were not washed.
The results of the "artifolds" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not record any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivation is decreasing, with the testants having to focus much more in the next tests.
If we had transferred the research results to the Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic when we got back from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs are not washing their hands, but along the way through the city transport it is a fifth.
Hygiene is also mostly adhered to after work in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 per cent of people wash their hands.
The baby's hunger is motivated to wash hands by 78.7 percent of people.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after a handshake to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a bit better," commented the survey's results, a skate doctor, Klaudie Komárková.
A tunnel for drug smuggling was found between the US and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated drugs smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico has been discovered, supplemented with its own lighting, ventilation and an electric railroad.
U.S. officials described a tunnel measuring roughly one by one by one meter as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds to a length of nearly six football pitches, connects a warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the US.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses, where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before the drugs could be brought in undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also intercepted eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who authorities say were working as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
If convicted, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life in prison.
In the town of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are infiltrating large drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which is building the problem of how to get its product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
Is Europe's elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign (trade for Britain) was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and define what changes in the EU's relationship to British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1,000 business leaders representing British businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The survey results will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritising new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than mired in a long and arduous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked for their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels' regulations now outweighed the benefits of being part of the European trade area - even 40 percent of the big business, the most pro-European companies, have so long.
Finally, our business leaders survey revealed the most eloquent realization, that the unequivocal majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not a policy.
The findings, with which businesses of different sizes and the main business groups have endorsed, show that the business sector is pushing for a "meaningful change" that will take back influence over Britain.
There is a lot at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better agreement for Britain can mean a gain of up to 16% in the referendum vote to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British membership of the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and increasingly necessary, given the eurozone's path as a narrower economic and fiscal union.
Jobs and growth in Britain must be a priority, and, as the results of our survey show, for business it means re-oriented to trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.

The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and North England will start as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "touch the UK together."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he had been "excited" by working with the British Government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of the Phase Two, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which held talks with the national transport office of Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to identify additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three or less hours.
Baroness Kramer said, "Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connects the UK and its cities."
We gave the SH2 the green light because the benefit it will bring is enormous.
Without this, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also a link – across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected thanks to the HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
Under the Scottish Government, Mr Carmichael's Keith Brown called for a 'one-figure' to support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The trek-speed line has the potential to bring immeasurable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds to Scotland's economic weight in the overall case of the high-speed rail across the UK."
So we are enthusiastically working with the British Government to investigate the possibility of bringing a high-speed rail to Scotland and thus benefiting everyone and adding the Glasgow-Edinburgh route, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British Ministers, over the next year and the joint decision-making on the next steps.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 on its flights for storing the carry-on baggage.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 for hand luggage and USD 2 for coffee or soda, although they said in their announcement on Wednesday that passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so the small baggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the passengers are waiting to be paid until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the barnstorm fee was to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to charge this fee," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second luggage provided in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and stuffed them into the hand luggage hidden in the storage compartment as hard as they could, so that there was often no room in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the purpose of this new fee was not really to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier's most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage compartment is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not be valid.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can bring in the luggage for which he will pay nothing, while the other ticketed queue for the same bag will pay USD 100.
O'Malley said the handling website and handling procedures would be modified to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before arriving at the gate.
The new fee for Frontier for hand luggage will not yet be in force before the summer, but a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
She argues that handling the baggage costs money, and the passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view the additional baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of losses.
Most, however, did not touch the charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost company, Allegiant Air, followed its example later.
The only company that also has such charges is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the pay for hand luggage to Spirit would bring in USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former senior executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he had seen at the gate when the passengers encountered an unusual payment from Spirit for hand-check.
"The uptake on the plane was the most tillasman I've ever seen in my flying career," he said.
I expected to see teeth gnashing and arguing at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the boarding took place in an instant."
Frontier, also following the example of Spirit, will apply the fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be refilled for free.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce beverage charges in 2008, but withdrew from it seven months later after complaints from passengers, and no major airline had emitted it.
Frontier's latest move to charge for hand-on luggage if a passenger does not purchase a flight directly from that airlines is to direct customers directly to their website.
Airlines pay online travel dealers such as Orbitz from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier went furthest in this area.
In September, it began giving to customers who had bought a travel agency through an online travel agency only half a mile as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for the flown mile to 25 percent miles from the road.
So a trip to Frontier, a 1,000-mile-hide purchased through an online travel agency, means a reward of $250m.
Customers are also allowed to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly via the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrinse and is losing money.
According to the financial results reported on Wednesday by the company partner of the Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 per cent and the transport capacity shrank by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter
By selling this airline, Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
We've studied 11 TISSUES THE DEST!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 job-seekers, including 4300 of them published in the daily press and 6800 advertisements (62 per cent) on the internet.
The internet is therefore becoming the most important media outlet for posting job offers.
As recently as 2005, when the survey was first conducted, his share was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it has stabilised at around 60 per cent.
The advertisement of the job options in themselves, according to the analysis, reflects a significant degree of current situation in the labour market.
Examples include a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during periods of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same reporting period, up from less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the internet is geared towards a narrower, in particular a more skilled group of professions.
By contrast, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including working-class professions, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.
The representation rate of selected professional groups is different for both media.
On the Internet, adverts seeking managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts have taken the tops.
The position of programmers or leading small businesses was only on the internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, while the large representation is mainly for service and working-class professions.
The most frequently cited requirements, which employers express through an advertising offer, are, of course, education.
Other areas surveyed included a knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.
In the daily press, the requirement to know a foreign language was made in three percent of advertisements, 37 percent on the internet.
Only two per cent of advertisements were employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in the daily press at 11 percent, on the internet in 57 percent).
Experience in the industry was required in 54 percent of the advertisements.
Practice requirements are generally associated with skilled professions.
These are in particular the production leaders and other managers.
For the blue-collar professions, it is mainly about mechanics and repairers or producers and processors of food products, or the repairers of electrical appliances, added the author of the study, Jiří Tillner.
Employers also list requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential applicants in half of their advertisements.
As the most frequently sought-after skills, communication skills have already appeared in the advertisement in the first place in the first place.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, accountability, organisational skills and reliability.
A fifth of shopping centres face low attendance
This is according to data from real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Business Centre is opening to the public in Bohnice, Prague, and will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now a total of 90 large department stores in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium and large centres.
The main problems are inadequately large centre-great center vis-à-vis the location and the poor layouts, i.e. too many floors or a complicated and messy arrangement of passages, or dead places of the centres," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of retail real estate department at Jones Lang LaSalle, Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the shopping centres are facing low attendance.
The main reasons include, among other things. poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or market oversaval in the place.
Some projects opened up almost fully filled, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, customers are a bit conservative and don't like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centres must do more to 'tack' their customers on the new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The occupancy rate of shopping centres is generally stable, according to Soták, rising for some centres, as landlords were willing to discount their rent in the crisis and to doper to deliver some units.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened up that are not fully booked and the average occupancy rate is decreasing (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
Shopping malls opened in the past two years have been very slow to market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a market place for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of the successful project is very limited.
In Prague, for example, we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly scope on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', focused on the purchase and services of daily use for the population living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.
According to Soták, there is also a place for other shopping centres on the domestic market.
This is for both small 'service' centres and for major projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extensions in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague he sees a space for the upcoming shopping centre on Victory Square, according to him they have the clear potential of Na Příkopě and Václavské náměstí streets.
"The expansion of retail parks is being intensively developed, allowing traders to be covered and expanded to be covered and expanded to other smaller cities at favourable rents and operating costs, the space is still in some locations for smaller local or housing shopping centres, respectively their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square metres of rough lettable space.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags behind by about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Parents of teenage Georgia boy who died in strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of the teenage boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a coiled wrestling spirit in his high school gym, believes their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th locked in a straightened ghost behind the bleachers in the high school gym he was studying.
Sheriff's investigators at the Lowndes County district concluded that Johnson died accidentally, but the family of the 17-year-old refuses.
"They are unequivocally convinced that their son was murdered," attorney Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he'd died the way the sheriff said he'd died.
"They believe it defies logic, the laws of physics, and also the common sense," Crump said.
They believe it should cover up for what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he came back in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions had gone unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
said Moore at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I'll be watching the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is sufficient basis for routine investigations," he said.
Moore told the newspaper that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "send-up choking."
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, gave a different cause of death.
"There are a few question marks that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence in the Johnson case to investigate a criminal offence or violation of civil rights, he will request the FBI and its implementation.
A deputy to the Sheriff's Office from the Lowndes precinct was not immediately available for a possible comment on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the surveillance camera videos examined by investigators.
The teenager's parents hope that the video footage will include a clue leading to the discovery of their son's death.
Report: Obama campaign considered swapping Biden for Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama's closest adviser secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket.
This revelation is the most important sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double down: Game Change Change 2012."
The Times magazine obtained a copy of the incoming book and announced Thursday evening that the president's senior aide had held intensive group meetings and surveys in late 2011 to estimate whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes of re-election.
According to the Times Magazine's National Political Compatch, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign, and in the White House, namely former White House Speaker Bill Daley, to measure the effect on the election of the move of former Secretary of State Clinton to the post of vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign's infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Just a few of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisors, David Axeld and David Plouffe, were known to consider this change.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket would "not raise Obama's chances substantially."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been researching a whole lot of things in intensity, and this was one of them," he told the Daley.
You mustn't forget that the president had a terrible prospect at the time, so we were like, "Christ, what are we to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "uvening care," Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had made a small investment to see if the move would be worthwhile in the election.
"Fraudits don't include that kind of money for elections and qualitative research unless something is really being considered," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama knew that his team was considering the exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential binge of the cards.
While Daley said he did not think the president was "aware of the potential changes," the former office manager admitted that it was "possible" to be known.
Martin added that the book "Double down" does not finally answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought that Obama was not aware of research regarding the deletion of Biden from the ticket.
"Perhaps," Martin said.
No, Mr. Hashk.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
Pressure is to be put in place to relieve Martin Hašek of all political positions and leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already slim.
Martin Hašek is shielded by the promise he made, but everyone and politician in particular need to be aware of the consequences of the promise and to give great consideration to what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital the politician has (Mr. Babiš also has the tangible one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The self-improvement program promoted by the liar is untrustworthy.
He doesn't apologize in politics, he steers in politics.
Mr. Hasek, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm that, if you've just been wrong - here you see how difficult it is with the lie), you leave politics yourself, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as a statement from the man who made the mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless weakling whose words or actions cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be a proud, if erring, person or a life-long sket.
It may seem to you to be unjust when I only address you, but you are the leader and they are just misguided sheep.
And you're the leader and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to lower your ears for a moment, regrouping the forces, sitting out the embarrassment, and then attack again, but that's how the guerrillas or the backstabbers behave.
You, I repeat, in your eyes, the leader, the alpha male, are so behave.
Accept responsibility and get out of politics.
The black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find the money to repair the crumbling motorway network, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box that can easily fit into your car's dashboard.
The devices that track every kilometre that the motorist drives, and that transmit this information to the authorities, is at the heart of Washington's controversial efforts and state-planning authorities to renovate the outdated US major-road funding system.
The usually bland design of the highways suddenly prompted an intense debate and the emergence of a variety of leagues.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these small box boxes to record the miles travelled and perhaps where you were going to – and then use that information to compile a tax placement.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy problems.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to proceed, some states are not waiting for anything.
They are looking at how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays per kilometre of the road he's on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter of which we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to start tracking the miles traveled by every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes changes.
This technology is used for this.
The impetus is the fact that the Road Trust Fund, financed by taxes, that Americans pay for at the gas stations, is at rock bottom.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
Cars will travel far more miles to one gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of petrol, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by just one cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system of payment for the kilometre travelled.
"In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user charge by the number of kilometres travelled.
It is no surprise that the idea is enjoyed by urban liberals, as taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, which, for example, can help reduce congestion and greenhouse gas creation.
California designers look to this system in planning strategies to meet the targets set out in the ambitious Global Warming Act.
But Republican Bill Shuster (deput to the Pennsylvania), chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market leaders at the Reason Foundation are also in favor of the idea that drivers will pay for the mileage travelled.
"It's not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at the organization's Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers who encouraged Congress in 2011 to move towards paying per kilometre.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives leadership rejected the proposal and did so because of concerns from rural legislators representing the members of the population, whose daily life often means to travel many miles for work outside the city.
But a few states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
The scoreliest is Oregon, which has included 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state the tax for the mileage travelled, instead of the tax on petrol.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is researching the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent for trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transportation, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
But this concept has no supporters alone.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned about the government being able to track their every move.
"Fearing concerns about the monitoring of the type of Big Brother and similar issues were a major issue," said Alauddin Khan, who heads the management of strategy and operations at the Vysett Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union warned in Nevada on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices."
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be extended to the record-keeping of daily and the arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the several states that seek to find the available technology that would allow the state to track how many kilometres the car will go, but not exactly when and where.
If you can, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
Hunt for such technology brought some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real distance travelled).
This firm was not originally involved in the action to help the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market for legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay on the basis of how much they would drive.
But this device that tests attracts the attention of the road network's designers because it does not use GPS and delivers only a limited amount of information that is regularly uploaded with a modem.
"People will be more willing to go for it if you're not following their speed and their location," says Ryan Morrison, True Mileage's CEO.
Some of these pilot programmes have produced a number of major errors.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experimenting with giving drivers the choice.
They can choose a GPS or no GPS device.
Or they don't have to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage travelled by all the residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accept this concept if the device is able to do more, no less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay for parking meters, to provide insurance by the mileage, and to collect the speed data of other drivers, so that motorists can avoid traffic.
"The motorists will be willing to participate because of the value of the benefits they are offered," the city's design document says.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all discussions about paying per kilometre are just a huge proxy.
Officials at the Metropolitan Transport Committee in San Francisco Bay say Congress could very easily resolve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the petrol tax increase.
A one-off or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrids or other cars that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"There's no need for a radical operation if you're more than enough to take the aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legisons and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Which billionaire will you be on the phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy O2 operator.
Both firms confirmed the negotiations and, according to various sources from the agencies and behind the scenes, the hand is already up to the sleeve.
The announcement of the transaction is expected to come in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequencies auction, before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor, Karel Komárek, owns the KKCG Group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, it embarked on an auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to general surprise, until then, the company's appetite for leaking into telecommunications had not been discussed.
But Sazka is now led by a very experienced telecom maverick Robert Chvátal.
He started out as the marketing chief of Radio and T-Mobile), then became director of T-Mobile, Slovakia, and headed the Austrian branch of the same operator for the last time.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She applied for the auction and has now admitted that she wants to launch a virtual podhal at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds at auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Vodafone would probably not like that under normal circumstances, but according to Hospodářské noviny, this may be part of a much closer collaboration between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of rival O2 and T-Mobile operators, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that may be Sazka.
If the latter succeeds in the tender for the LTE networks (as a newcomer, it can auction a specially designed spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not mind the auctioning of only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone and Sazka can share networks.
Vodafone will release Sazka to its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network at the 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
Sazka in between will start building a costly LTE network that Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The money saved could then be spent by Vodafone on some fixed internet provider or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of a Czech one) to acquire an immediately fully-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big juke that's going to be expected to restructure.
In the auction, the LTE networks would have been acquired by Kellner for O2 and, very likely, in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both firms have already declared that they will share networks.
The auction could thus finally end in success, but quite probably not with the high amounts enjoyed by the state budget.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between the calls with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September over a protest against planned oil drilling in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
AFP reported the news today, citing the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
She also claims that the original accusations by her piracy activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that the 30 men and women detained in Russia following a nonviolent action against an oil rig in the Arctic have been transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to DPA, it was a planned move.
The authorities first accused the environmentalists of piracy, for which they faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week, they announced that the charge would be replaced by a more lenient riot service, which carries a lower sentence with a lower term of seven years in prison.
But Greenpeace pointed out in a statement today that the charges of piracy have not yet been taken by the authorities, as promised.
That means the detainees are now charged with two felonies.
The powerful Committee of Investigations announced last week that he would replace the charges of piracy with disorderly conduct charges.
But when the 30-three of the prisoners faced the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, a new charge was filed against each of them," AFP quoted Greenpeace as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from the 18 countries of the Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which was flying the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of the imprisoned.
According to AFP, the CEO of Greenpeace, Kumi Naidoo, said today that the move to St. Petersburg would facilitate the meeting of detainees with their families and consular workers.
But there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They can actually be worse," he cautioned.
The Dutch king Willem-Alexile of Alexandra was asked for help by one of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to discuss their situation at a scheduled meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a mobster against police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass information on to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared his drug addiction would come out.
A Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who briefed the drug mobster on a major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was to forward sensitive information to the head of the underworld to Neil Scarbrough, after becoming a suspect in cocaine use, to relay sensitive information about his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was hailed by the criminals as the best legal guard, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police surveillance by Scarborough, whom he represented in previous narcotics proceedings.
Officers saw Sarborough (32) leave three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, which had just been at dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on tests to find traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of a Class A-Class A drug user.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to covertly gather information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being tracked at the time as part of a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After police intercepted heroin and cocaine worth about £1.5 million in cash during a series of raids, police arrested a further £2.00,000 in cash, with another 32 people ending up in prison.
Ditta (42) passed the information to criminals for fear of coming up with his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at the Blackburn-based Forbes Solicitors, was in a shameful time before the Liverpool Crown Court when, after a three-week trial, he was found guilty of defending justice in two cases.
During an earlier hearing, he confessed to holding cocaine.
The lawyer's downfall came after a police investigation by Scarborough found that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's home, and spotted him placing drugs about the cleanliness of 60 percent under the lawyer's black golf basket.
Subsequently, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home to find the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
The court heard that traces of the A-grade drug were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards on his credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, and said he spoke to the suspect dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell under "confidential communication."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all detained and her hair samples were taken.
During the police interview, he said that he ran an office at both his home address and the workplace, and that clients had also visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he had contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Whoever else is more aware that he must not violate the law other than the criminal prosecutor."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as an attorney and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about the drug dealer, it's about the drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the usual lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation was obstructing as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession; he disgraced it.
He became too close to his clients, especially with Scarboroughem, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta dismissed the offence, saying, "If I were a corrupt lawyer I'm not, and I'd like to give Mr. Scarborough information, I wouldn't have expected 15 hours, but I'd do it immediately."
However, after the hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said, "Mr. Ditta himself became a criminal from the criminal attorney himself when he started getting drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organized crime groups, who tasked him with gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
Legal advocates must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and are to inspire confidence and the public to feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire has conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now for obstructing the administration of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing the criminal to justice.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law's hands.
We will find you and bring you before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of league for the supply of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in the deal were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, saying that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner he would like Mohammed Ali to join and cited inequality as motivation for the job.
Obama backs off health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama backed away from hist-repeated and ambitious promise yesterday that "if you like your health program, you can keep it."
Citing hundreds of thousands of reports of testimonies from providers, Republicans have accused the president of misleading the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama flinched from his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
In light of what he called a "rexy in the media about the testimonies," Obama called on the Americans who received these announcements to search for new safeguards in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not come as a surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchased the insurance for themselves can be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements given by the Affordable Care Act.
"I'm telling these Americans to this: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her testimony before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet market had been "inhabit" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry as I am," she said.
I'll try to regain your trust.
The irritated Sebelius uttered that phrase, which was picked on, addressed the microphone on her yesterday in the direction of the adviser sitting behind her at the Committee's meeting yesterday, which took place after a rouse exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, about whether she, too, had to join the Obama program herself.
For more than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly pressed the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act voluntarily did not give up government-sponsored insurance, and did not forbade the program through HealthCare.gov, which is now imposing on millions of Americans.
He travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 female Topical candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes Award, you can vote for him or any of the other ten main candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Cameroon's capital, Yaounde.
At first he was treated only with a broken arm, but subsequently developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he created a hematoma that had caused problems for him all his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside of Cameroon if we had the money to do it.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There are many patients out there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, things have not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per population.
And even if the Cameroonian doctors could be visited, many would not be able to afford it.
Two of the country's five people live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's healthcare spending is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
With the sake of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 operations for free last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon doctor at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas over the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped his group of volunteers with nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are packed in vans, attaching medical supplies to the roofs, and travel through rough terrains to villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they receive a welcome as real heroes: a feast, a singing and a dance, and the best accommodations the community has to offer.
In these villages, medical care is really a free reason to celebrate, and Bwelle, with his broad smile and unbridled energy - is very willing to engage in the local merriment.
The next day, the team begins nursing hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition," says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a 60-kilometer radius on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate – a document required by the school, but which many of the miserable families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team does simple surgery under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, in the town hall or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery point to make way for the next patient.
Using the light from the generator, the operating room and the hygiene equipment of Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose their motivation.
"To stay awake and keep working, they play drums all night long," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year, realising that their help could mean a lot to local residents.
One man said he would be able to work again after the hernia surgery.
"That will change our family's future," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private medical clinics around Yaounde.
He says that it is this second job that funds about 60% of his nonprofit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is a year of medics at Drexelphia University in Philadelphia and volunteers for Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwell on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We were washing our hands thoroughly for Dr. Bwelle and removing the blood spots or holding his instruments," says O'Malley.
As a second-year medical student in America, you'll never experience it.
Students of volunteers usually pay for their own trip to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But as soon as they reach Yaounde, food, transport, and their studies are provided by Bwelle.
"No doubt he's a hero," says O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the constant struggle is not a burden.
To help others live happily, to fulfill the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Bwelle says.
And I think about my father.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
To laugh at people, to alleviate their pain - that's why I do it.

Central banks to keep swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to give banks access to global currencies whenever they need.
The banks made the comments in their joint statement.
"This is a very sensible step," commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays, a London bank.
"So far, all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is not surprising to me," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are reinforcing the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market falters for the first time.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars, and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers' decision comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its program to support the US economy, which could drive the price of money in the global market even higher.
By default, the swap contract is used to overcome the liquidity shortages of one currency, while the other currency's liquidity surplus.
It can be seen as a deposit of one currency and a loan of currency to another.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to return confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, with the ECB overseeing 150 banks.
Number of HIV infections exceeds 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infections grows every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed an infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and by 2010 there were already 180 of them.
Last year, there were 212 infections and a record number.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200, I don't think there is a doubt," said Miroslav Hlavatý, an AIDS expert who ran the Prague House of Lights for Patients for Forces for years.
According to him, 165 HIV patients were added to the country from January to September last year, with 176 over the same period this year.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of this September, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 infected people resided.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian and 116 from Ústí nad Labem.
The fewest in those infected come from the Highlands, 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected in the past in blood transfusion.
Such a case, however, has not occurred in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, i.e. more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, and he transferred to them from his mother.
Children should be taught to myths and legends as "models for a way of life," says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that "the coarse force cannot be equal to clever cunning," while the arthismen's legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Much of the myths would be "more wild, too scandalous for teaching at school," said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of works of the appropriate age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk creations are already part of education," he said.
I have defended this plan for 20 years.
He added that the "openly instructive" authors and teachers are a "subduct" message for children in an engaging story with a "switch."
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Tories, says, "You may have good intentions, but you will do better to keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is a need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end by a happyend, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconsciously; revealed through a story, not openly established.
The old truth about the fact that it is better to show than to describe.
Miloslava Cejpková: November's smile
It came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, what we're not used to yet.
First she put down her smile, the one she kept on display as a defense against the would-be friendly surroundings.
That made her very relieved, because it was a mask she chose not to be put off in public.
He was only sincere at home on the days when she was grandmotherly and had grandchildren Elinka or Adim.
And, of course, when her sons phoned her.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless course of business skills.
Now they were finally in perfect use.
So she doesn't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into the corner.
Like a masquerade's disguise.
November, or any other moon, can't do the miracle to make a smile, like when they were on a trip with the one that hasn't been around for almost three years.
Pierre Rainero: I try to make Cartier's style evolve like a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition while leading our brand to modern things to avoid leaving a dusty relic, explains Pierre Rainero, the director of style at Cartier, in an interview with HN.

GM is pulling down some new light trucks in the US to repair seat backrests
According to Friday's announcement from the U.S. Automotive Safety Authority, General Motors is pulling down nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) light trucks, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, to repair a fault with a manual tilting backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the front-seat tilting mechanism may have a fault.
As a result, the backs of the seats are not in line with the federal standards of automotive safety for headrests.
A notice posted on the website of the StateSF of Transportation Safety website (NHTSA) says that "if the car gets a crash from behind, the headrest of the header may not protect the passenger correctly, which increases the risk of injury."
The downloaded models were made between 1 August and 10 September.
GM made the shipment to the market in June and is the most important launch for this leading US automaker since restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery owner of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the announcement to the owners due to the government's 16-day dysfunction, which weakened the rise in car sales in October.
Sales of deliveries of Silverado and Sierra, which were revised for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 of the Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models from its deliveries.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Too inquisitive newspapers to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator told the press.
New Express newspaper, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public petition for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to make up stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said the New Express newspaper would now make a "full correction."
The regulation for "right-up" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
A preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, New Express newspaper from the Yangcheng group Evening News had published several false reports on the company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was disordered," the administrator said in his statement.
He said he had to decide to "have Chen Yongzhou's administrative punishment in the form of the cancellation of the journalism's license."
He also "arranged the yangcheng group Evening News to carry out a comprehensive correction to the New Express and recommend that they examine the relevant responsible persons in New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express paper."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express on financial irregularities in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page, claiming he was behind his journalism's work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted to making false stories in return for the payment.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the state news broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was coveting money and fame.
I realize I acted badly.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front-page apology in which it said it had failed to do a sufficient check of his reports.
Recently, several high-profile suspects have been admitted to television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly coerciled, regardless of a change in this year's law that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
With the growing misery of the middle class, pawnshops are taking off in Singapore
At a pawn shop in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's tuition.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I gave all my money," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 of $2400 each month as an administrator (SGD) and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is that ValueMax, where a woman is making her transaction, became the third pawnshop on the list this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quicker route to borrowing cash - the SGD 1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga - but is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The Singapore pawnshops routinely apply the annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, the paittals have the advantage of not requiring the verification of a person (a history) or proof of income, and they can provide a loan more quickly than banks.
And that's why families feel pressure from rising living costs and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit backed by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households, mainly because of rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in view of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high level of consumption debt in Thailand, which this week barely came out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a weak increase in consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with increasing costs, people from the low to the low [revenge scale] will try to replenish their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia's CIMB Bank.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to people hastily stopping their personal assets and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family's jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in the city's 200 stalwarts are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's golden necklace and get it back next month.
The largest pawnstrike operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
Growth in the pawnshop sector is so great that ValueMax, the branch operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax Executive Director Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it won this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the pledge offers lower rates not only lower than other creditors, but it also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers are stopping items they already own, and the realisation of personal property does not increase the household's debt," he says.
In the company, the stockpiling of assets is increasingly being accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure funding.
Moreover, among those who use the pawn shop, it is not just people in financial distress.
Wealthy people from Singapore also use the ValueMax branches when they stop the Rolex's gold rods or their Rolex watches, allowing them to reach up to 60 per cent of the purchase price of cash.
Our customers are from all sorts of backgrounds.
"These are the wealthy individuals who need to borrow for the short term because of their bold shops or investments, or small businesses that need help solving the problems in their cash flow," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as fast as they can.
The NSA website's collapse is not blamed by hackers, but by an "internal flaw"
The mysterious National Security Agency reported last Friday that its website crashed for hours last week due to an internal error, not because of an attack by hackers, as some claimed online.
"NSA.gov's depots were not open for several hours this evening because of an internal error that occurred during the regular update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be eliminated during the evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by the DDoS (distributed service rejection) is not true.
Earlier this night, online server sensors noted that the NSA's website had not worked for at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the internal sensitive networks of the agency had not been "at risked" at all.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of online hacking activists claimed to be responsible for disposing of the NSA's site through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overtaken and the site falls.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple, and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, which was once dubbed No such an agency, has become the focus of public attention in the past few months following a string of revelations in foreign and domestic surveillance programs, and the target of a biting critique of the product of the NSA's secret files of the agency and their disclosure by the disilluted former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of HIV infections in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the follow-up in 1986 to the end of this year's third quarter, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is clear from the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the National Institute of Health.
According to her, there were still 2,063 infections in the whole Czech Republic.
In 396 immune deficiency illnesses have already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new infections and in 2010 it revealed 180.
The year before last, the number dropped to 153, but it was a record-breaking situation last year.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year is no longer in my opinion a doubt," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the start of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV was confirmed by HIV and 353 women in 1710.
AIDS has broken out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of this country: Presidents on the brink of power
It is almost the norm that, at the country's key moments, the head of state was not in the form of being able to meet his statesmanship.
If he were T. Masaryk, physically and mentally, five years younger, would live to see the end of his presidential term, and the events surrounding Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the war, but after a symbolic backing, the air force could fly across the border, the heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not struggle to fight for its legitimacy there.
Above all, the nation would not have a hangover from the surrender to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and was still in shape for Munich, but it started to go downhill with him during the war and in February 48, he did so accordingly.
To be a little better off, he could go into exile for the third time and undermine the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hách.
They elected him, saying that "the president will not get into a situation for him to make decisions."
But he had to, though the big decision with the knife on the neck at Hitler's chancellery probably wasn't there.
The head of intelligence, František Moravec, until the last days of March 1939 said what should be done, so that the occupation, which he knew exactly for the day, did not go off to the Germans so smoothly and with such a profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, both did not believe him and were afraid.
The human wreckage, Gottwald, had his age-old fellow-comrades executed, as Moscow had told him.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitely barred from participating in the normalisation and had to be unseated, already completely senile.
That Husák was powerless and the sick depressing old man made things easier in November 89, but that is the only positive.
Havel was lucky not to meet him in office in the last few years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus may still be a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Now we have this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces look like he is and we don't know all about that yet.
Fortunately, there is no threat to the Republic external at risk now.
Or maybe it's threatening, just not to see.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is (in historical terms) as well as not entirely at strength.
But it is not a normal state.
Couldn't we elect someone acceptably thinking and conventionally healthy as president in this country again?

Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
TOP 09 President Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the last one in an interview with Aktuálně.cz, he said there was no other way out, and every government resulting from the vote last Friday and Saturday was an impossible patchwork.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, estimating the lifetime of the start of the term of the term within two years.
He disagrees with the objection that voters will hardly choose in a completely different way next time, "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the TOP 09 president does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as it did this year (it lost around 300,000 votes compared to 2010.
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that there would be an early election, it would strengthen the ANO 2011 movement of Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will be losing.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where the chairman, Bohuslav Sobotka, said after a clandestine meeting of the party leadership that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of the Social Democracy, Schwarzenberg comments in his own:
"The leading officials of the democratic party as little boys go to the head of state to allow them to take a coup in the party."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was smarter and more intelligent."
"Because I have never seen anything so implored in my life," the TOP 09 chairman added.
And in the direction of President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the battle for the presidency) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take the party's seizure."
The first laws have already been introduced by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the House of Commons, including the Farsky Register of Treaties, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the TOP 09 chairman argues that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed."
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, ANO election leader Martin Komárek accused TOP 09 of the election fight that the idea of introducing a register of treaties "craising" the ANO program.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it has simply dusted off a proposal that was on its way to a second House reading.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check the tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used methods of "taking into the phone, watching and confronting" to confirm a fraudulent tip for the love affair that was to involve then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
U.S. Attorney's Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that News of the World newspaper had picked up fake news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and break into her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson, too, had called her and left her with voice messages.
"The public prosecutor is suggesting that Mr. Coulson, who is now NotW's editor, is not the man in front of the house, hoping to catch people out there, but a man who likes to give people stories to see what they say," said Mr Edis.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore the stories: hacking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He clearly knows about the other one, the surveillance, he must know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "Oh, of course he knows."
The rumors about Clarke's love relationship were first captured by the NotW News Agency when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions, he was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found the records on the private investigator's computer, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects."
During Mrs. Pawlby's time to be under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls in asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief correspondent Neville Thurlbeck and former correspondent James Weatherup were overseeing the tracking of Ms Pawlby's movements.
Coulson eats 18. June 2005 left a voice message in which he told her, "I got the story we're about to publish tomorrow and I would love to talk about with Charles."
Mr Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same model as other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The court heard on Thursday that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett for his love affair with a married woman, while he himself was seeing the co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied getting in league with other people to hack into their phones in the period from 3. October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to hacking into the phone.
Ben Greenman: New York Comedy's 10th Anniversary Festival of New York
It could be argued that the city of New York is the place where a solo comic performance was born in America: almost a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the people of the scree of the conversation method.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Festival of Comedy.
The festival, founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the solo comedy Carolines, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in the Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to be played at the club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes" (to stand up for heroes), an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has spread, the world of comedy has spread.
Several comedians attending this year's festival came from unconventional channels such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose with his sitcom (the cheerle spicy "League" to the FXX Fantmaneuver and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation" program, but was most famous for her fast-spreading series of "Marcel the shell with shoes on" videos.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognisable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the caustic, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), is the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will speak with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of the comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting is held at Town Hall in Midtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he walks down the aisle sometimes between two buildings, and he's like, man, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Many things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that one could agree with it, whereas Chairman Štěch was stirring up a discord.
The commissioner, Chovanec, was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau and confirmed it.
Chairman Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed off their weaknesses in the main.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, with Vice-President Zaoralek making it the most impossible to interview on television.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better option than for the ČSSD to nominate the Vice-President of the Senate, Gajdůšková, the only one who would not have had the initial handicap and I think she would perform at the standard.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support him.
I would add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and proceed without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with a mere blessing from President Babiš and without the Peoples' Peoples, but with the People's Minister of Health, Hovorka, who is actually a religious social democrat.
This mini-state government would have great stability, because it would enforce a proper referendum law, and such a commitment was to be supported by the President of the Dawn, Okamura.
In the end, President Babiš would accept the progression of the tax, for he is keen and will see that it cannot be done without it.
The Peoples would not bring problems, because Hovorka is the bearer of the best they have, and they would not be in government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, there would be a valuable minister, but if they rationally do not want to enter into risky government participation, but they will provide support, also well.
Let's give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
The detention of Bárta is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is he behind the leak of wiretaps?
The chairman of Public Affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Along with him, the head of the Department of Analytics and Informatics of the Anti-Corruption Police, Jan Petržílek, was detained.
The detention is linked to wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the wiretaps, which came to news server Novinky.cz, was confirmed by a trusted source to the Czech Press Office.
The intercepted phone calls by Janoušek and Bém published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which the two men address each other "Mazánka" and "Kolibřík," show Janoušek's influence in the actions of the city under Bém's leadership.
The Journal reported at the time that they were acquired by the Security Information Service (BIS) in 2007, from which they leaked to the security agency ABL two years later.
It was then owned by Barta.
News server Novinky.cz reported that the detained criminologist Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which was subsequently involved in the interceptors, at the same time it was made public.
"With regard to the Act on the Protection of Classified Information, I can't confirm or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case is not to be commented on by the inspection for the same reason.
He and Vít Bárta also detained an anti-corruption police officer
Bart's defense attorney, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption by VV MPs, did not want to comment too much on the case either, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter as well, but I cannot comment further, given the protection of the classified information."
According to Právo, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS).
Tn.cz reported that Bárta could have been buying classified information from the police.
According to the news server, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment Barta was allegedly sought.
But the latest information from Právo shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is not related to Petr Lessy.
Police Presidium spokeswoman Eva Kropáčová declined to comment, saying that the case was being handled by the Prague Municipal Prosecutor's Office.
"We will not comment on this inquiry with regard to the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, told Právo on Friday.
It is the prosecutor there who is overseeing Bart's case, and her words therefore implicitly imply that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under secrecy.
News reporter managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta, Kateřina Klasnová, in the morning in front of their residence in Prague's Klárov.
She was loading her suitcases into the car and leaving.
She declined to comment on the incident.
On Friday morning, Dawn's leader, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bart's detention.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of many of the candidates of many of the parties on our ticket, and as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not even a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy movement in the House of Representatives in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case of the bribery of Public Affairs MPs.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months, suspended for 30 months.
Eventually, the sentence was changed and Barta was acquitted.
Concerns about Mozambique's security escalate over strong personality conflict
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founding president of the Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to cheer peace slogans at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, the CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she traded her company garb for a T-shirt adorned with the words "we demand safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, there were reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party almost daily, one of the worst scuffles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally backed by the white government in Rhodesia and then the government of apartheid in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that an open conflict breaks out again in the country, but recent events have startled foreign investors and locals.
A fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discoveries of large-scale coastal reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest may bring investments worth more than $50 billion over the next few years from companies such as Brazil's Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy's Eni and the American Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have blamed each other for the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the government sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional Renamo Party stronghold on September 17.
The violent attack of the former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and tried to kill Afonsa Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo Fernando Mazanga, told the Financial Times.
The government is accusing Renamo of triggering the conflicts because he is said to have attacked the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to alleviate the fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told the French press office AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "lossskotka" who wanted to use "whatever he did, to try to prove to the government that he could order his own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid the war.
But fears increased when Mr. Mazanga's words were quoted as Reneamo's withdrawal from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the deal.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but to make a serious amount of seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease the tensions between these parties, fueled by a series of skittms this year.
It's a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and the Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought to make electoral changes, has already commented that it would boycott the local elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the dying movement to gain benefits and financial returns from the government.
Renamo's campaign share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Mozambique (DHM), founded by a former member of the Renamo party, will improve its position in the election, as expected.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza – who is through his second term next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a democratic system of multiple parties, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want to make peace because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but carried out divisive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key north-south road.
Most of the skoffins took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres away from Maputo's capital, but where the city of Beira, the port on which the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on is exported by coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad for about a week when the Renamo side threatened to attack the route.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community for the situation in Mozambique that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the government's frustration, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also worried about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnapping.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country rests solely with the government and the president, and that he is to be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"Nobody cares about Renama or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State's Corruption Supervisory Committee.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied that he was changing the coastal leasing policy at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday expanded its search to see if Mr Obeid had lobbied to a few state ministers to resume his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café, without having to take part in a tender after it expired in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating the claim that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's clandestine interests in these properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
Over the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for leases to tender.
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of the ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a fan of the public tenders.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, Mr. Tripodi admitted, had urged a move in the government's lease policy.
The transcript of the calls submitted to the ICAC showed the calls from August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr. Tripodim and Steve Dunne, the lead official who came to the resort of the ports after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was he the subject of interviews during these phone calls the development of the commercial leasing policy?" aide, aid commissioner, asked Mr. Tripodi, an auxiliary commissioner.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but certainly not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
RIGHT, 1 November 2013
Dog scooped up carpet, president tripped and ended up on crutches
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left the Motol Hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and left for the castle in Lány.
What is his health?
Cabbage bubbles in Kunovice, they don't add chemistry to it
They want to produce more than 1,000 tonnes of sauerkraut cabbage in the coming months in Slovácké Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and will last about six months.
He has produced a healthy delicacy here since 1925 in the traditional way, i.e. pedalling right in the big dances.
In modern industrial times, it is a rarity.
Our female workers tread a shift for a nearly ten-kilometre route.
Each of the ten tanks can hold fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," said the director of the Slovácká Fruta plant, David Kladroba.
Cabbage mussels are brought to the company's area directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsko and Břeclav.
Fruta's employees then cleanse the vegetables, remove the broomsticks and throw them in the ring.
From there, the already sliced cabbage falls into swimming pools of six-metre depths, where the pedalers work tirelessly, clad in white clothing and boots.
This oust the unwanted air.
The last trodden layer of cabbage is covered with a tarp and load with water.
"The noticeable twist is then aged for six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation substances," the director of Kladroba stressed.
The natural process corresponds to production in domestic conditions, with individual layers sipping the workers with salt and cumin.
The cabbage after the fermentation travels to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet and sour brine for sachets or jars and subjected to sterilics.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It also has registered interest in it in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Damkova is said to be banned by UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the referees' committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing the sentences for the judges.
UEFA rules forbid it, as they said in an interview with the daily newspaper Právo.
Otherwise, he said, FAČR would face penalties.
Damkova also denied siding with the Pilsen footballers where she came from in her role.
This speculation is really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example, from Prague.
So in the case of the vote I can lose 1:6," Damkova said in response to the criticism that has been booming after Plzeň has recently played twice as many penalties as the other league teams.
Thus, although the FACR has stopped publishing penalties for referees in recent months, Damkova assures that the referees are paying the price for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the board finds out that the referee made a mistake, he will restrict his delegation, whatever the match," Damk said.
The reason for not to be released is a ban on the European Football Union, according to Damka.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and punishes the breach harshly."
"We're very suspicious of us, and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We made the restrictions public, but I received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop doing this, there will be tough sanctions," Damk said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If the disclosure continued with the disclosure, the commission could lose UEFA's money to educate and develop referees.
"And they are very important to us."
"We could not fulfill the program without them for the education of referees," Damk added.
Does the internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base pre-tax profit to be between USD 325 and 340 million, up from USD 305 to 315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17% increase in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said the Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half of the year and began a sharp rise in the second half, mainly in Australian and British non-working travel.
"As of today, our 10 countries are profitable, and several are heading for a record-breaking annual pre-refund and tax gain," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which is traditionally our biggest creator of profit.
The business of recreational activities has risen during the second half of the year in Australia, offsetting the slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the recreation area, while business clients spent less.
The US trade has recovered after a loss during the season-lower half-year and is expected to make a full-year profit for the third consecutive season.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
British police deliver extradition notice to Assange
British police today delivered an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had delivered a "issue of extradition" to the 40-year-old Australian, saying he was asking him to appear at the police station and that if he did not, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange has exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court this month overturned his appeal against extradition, facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sex crimes.
Fearing that Stockholm would go to the US, he sought out the 19th. June's refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard "delivered the extradition notice to the 40-year-old man, whom he asks to attend the police station on the day and hour that was addressed to him," the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage because he has released 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The Supreme Court ruled: Nečas can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas could also be prosecuted for any crimes he could have committed before the dissolved of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by the procedural immunity that applies to speeches in the House.
On the contrary, in the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Marko Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, he decided that they could not be punished for possible offences until they gave up their parliamentary mandate last November, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig said.
The court's decision rejected the motion of the public prosecutor, Ivo Izzard, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the MPs.
They, he said, accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in passing the laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can be prosecuted.
Aircraft manufacturers argue over seat width, big orders are at stake
There was a dispute between the aircraft's lead manufacturers over the width of seats in the second-class for long-distance flights, which this month gave rise to the cause of a bitter exchange of views on the Dubai air show.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that airlines would usually be preceded by, but whose assigned space is the key to the demands for efficiency in the latest aircraft offered by Airs SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industrial standards to offer at least 46 cm wide economy-class seats, but US-based rival Boeing says airlines are to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales with the largest version of its twin-engined long-distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.
The way the rear of the aircraft is distributed – especially whether it is side by side by side by side 9 or 10 seats - is the basis for economic performance claims for the proposals of the new minic-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the improved "777X" will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out by 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public before the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
He recently tentatively showed what the start of a new advertising war may be when he showed financiers a picture depicting three people crammed at a restaurant with the headline "Would you like to be hitting?"
"Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft," Airbus sales manager John Leahy said.
As the eating habits change, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to data from the US Department of Health.
According to American health statistics, the average American has a waist of 100 cm in the 21st century.
Airbus claims that his rival sticks to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average seat width of the newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research suggesting that the seating extension by 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing rejects Airbus seat dimensions, saying it is not within the competence of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export charges and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
"It really is about giving the airlines flexibility and enabling them to do things they believe they have to make to be successful," said Cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
More room for elbows is essential for passengers, but it is a growing problem for suppliers that can affect returns.
Behind this dispute is a plant in aircraft orders with an estimated deal worth at least $700 billion in the next decades at catalogue prices, enough to deflect the scales of the US and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent better efficiency of their latest designs for the four-engine long-distance aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
Boeing's performance requirements depend in part on a comparison of the design of the Model 777X with 10 seats in the row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit at unit cost is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
"The reason Boeing does this is to pack more seats and make its planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus's European passenger comfort.
On the other hand, analysts say that the 10-seat cabins in the row for the existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"The four-five-centimetre-wide seat would be great for the passenger, but the reality is that from Airbus's entrepreneurial point of view, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777," said the cabin interior expert, Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to make a choice.
The travelled aircraft dealers even carry a measuring band with them to check the competing arrangements.
While I boast convenience, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a highly dense layout for low-cost and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for a larger cabin to be modified by offering wider seats in the aisles on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard, but may discourage the wave of 777X sales.
The CME is targeting the TV business.
They release almost a quarter of the people.
Media group CME will be making redundant.
By the end of the year, he wants to slim down by a thousand people.
He intends to sew up all the ailing activities and only wants to focus on his core business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.
As a result, almost a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs some 650 people, and what this will mean for TV Nova's domestic TV number one, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really cannot comment on it," said Josef Koukolíček, director of communications at Nova.
According to MF DNES, significant layoffs of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should be on the staffing levels of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new bosses of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined long-time director Adrian Sarbo, talked during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday about wanting to cut back on all activities not directly related to the TV business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing its own programmes, the filmmaking and production activities in particular.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of the defunct Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, on Thursday, a company rejuvenated at an auction in the bankruptcy of Nortel.
Rockstar, a Seclo-Partium that bought Nortel's $4.5 billion patents, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. circuit court in Texas for violating the patent.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps combine terms searched online with the appropriate advertising, the lawsuit, which is the crux of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce phones that operate on the Google Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a starting price offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the fight for the patents of Nortel, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by Motorola's patents group.
"Despite the failure of the attempt to obtain the patents at the auctionement, Google has violated and continues to be in breach of patents," the lawsuit reads.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because, in its view, Google's patent is committed intentionally, as the lawsuit alleges.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that a condition for the independent Scotland's membership of the EU would be his accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to the stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along the Hadrian Wall.
The truth is that Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as you might expect – this was not reflected in the headlines.
No one also mentioned that EU Member States spend a multitude of time adapting their official laws to suit them.
With Scotland not being in Schengen now, the offer of an ongoing mismatch would be a cheap retreat for Brussels for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
Plus, he's so old that he's become a dig. A journalist's duck that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is one interesting thought in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland even be expected to listen to Europe?
Why trade the London yoke for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: a great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The euro's crisis is caused by the so-called Europe Project to officially die.
Across Europe, the party's insurers of resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came as if out of nowhere and already in the September federal election, capturing nearly five million votes, effectively "sweating out" the Freedom Democrats (the British Liberal Democrats' equivalence) from the Bundestag.
There has always been opposition on home soil to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with a straitjacket drawn on to the national economies through the adherence to the common currency, led many people to think that the Europe project had gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a high budget deficit – only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a euro-chickset system that blocks its members at exchange rates advantageous for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only help is to cut revenue and public spending – which is prompted by Germany.
The current problems with the budget and the currency are due to the deeper cause of Europe's languor in d'etat performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German firms at the expense of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in the cost area, as we have already seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even all the pay freezes in the world would not avert the stamping of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering mutiny, especially in France, once-enthated predecessors of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that Germany would rein in to rein in and allow Paris to stand up to the level of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a card of political legitimacy, and has pushed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major additional election and moved the ruling Socialists to third place.
The queue is now, with 24% of the vote, the most popular party in France – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that the fission of the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen handle her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use next year's European elections to create an anti-European anti-curreine bloc across the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in this election, which is likely, such a bloc may dominate the European Parliament for the first time in the history.
It occurs to me that in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will come together and the euro will be wiped out.
The EU will not disappear, but will be transformed into something more free in the sense of the 'Europe of the (Sovereign) nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will re-estate their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and cling to the United States.
But Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area of (basically) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when to leave us alone.
I suppose Scotland would do well in a relaxed order of Europe, provided it retains its own currency.
Working with other like-minded countries would be simpler in the unfaturated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example from Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement that does not advocate austerity measures in Europe, which was won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to an opposition stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now chose independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Parents of intersex children may choose the 'different sex'
Germany became the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with ambiguous sex tract.
Newborn children will no longer be ranked only with either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any sexes for such children, and allows them to refer to their birth certificates of gender as "uncertain" or "unspecified."
The law aims to stop pressuring parents to make a hasty decision for a sex-determination operation for their child and to fight discrimination against intersexuals.
An intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'll remain a poop with a doctor-spinned, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year, of the 2,000 children, one born that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, the umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, the gorges (wailers or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
The intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender Determining is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when a sex cannot be identified, it is better to use the best available information and to determine it instead of waiting to be observed and monitored the child's psychological and physical development until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-determination problems, said the new German law "looks like a good thing."
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but it's not the case with most children," he said.
Identifying the sex can be performed without surgery and can then wait to see how the identity develops.
Knowing how a child's sexual affiliation develops is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery as to why some people are gay.
The report transmitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexuals as different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not gender bound, but to their biological structure, which is neither male nor female, but typically composed with both, and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair cover, bust and character, in the primary sexual characteristics such as reproducing organs and the sex tract, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transsexual people in the work field, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't answer to any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to be identified in official documents by the male, female or "third genders."
In June, Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexless" person by winning a court appeal to retain the status of "non-certain" sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, in addition to M M (man) and F (f), the third designation, X, for intersex people, the German passports will have as well as the M.
In neighbouring France, according to a news report on France 24, the gender issue is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this fiercely Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "sex theory" from the school textbooks.
American Catholic online pages have also defined themselves against German law and wrote, "With the world being dragged to a new state where gender is a matter of choice but not, we will turn two more pillars of civilization inside out."
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see the children have their gender assigned at birth.
"Parating yourself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she told the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female genders have been called hermaphrodites, according to a handsome Greek who had a double sex.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that gender was something like a blackboard that could be deleted and redrawn.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of the operation, saying that sexual affiliation is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong choice, because they don't know how, given their gender, children will feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you weren't calling for a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
Persistent the theory of how to treat children with ambiguous gender was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that the gender was pliable.
He created a new concept of "sexuality" and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment - how the parents raised their child - affected children's genes and hormones and formed the child, regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in a case in 1966, known as "John/Joan," his theory became questionable.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged because of a mismanaged, to have their child completely castrated, removed his testicles and raised him as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful conversion case, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he got re-operated to the boys and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors still use "this model" to this day.
But in the '90s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations discovered "unhappy with the outcome."
It was also the case for Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex tramp.
Doctors weren't sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfying life."
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's outer organs and testicles were surgically removed and brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent to scout sheath.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
I was sterilized after I was born and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a gender disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he turned back to men, took the testosterone dose and had his bosom removed,
The operations caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of those who are intersexual.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the law group Advocates through the foreword for the choice, based in California, fears that the German law "calls for branding and stigmates."
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will achieve that they will encourage parents to make a quick decision to choose the child's 'unidental'," she said.
We're afraid it'll encourage intervention.
We believe it is better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will come to be, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because it "allows adults to choose to be classified in the third sex."
"The adult should be able to make their own decisions about the legally applicable sex," she said.
German law is about to be awarded at birth.
This is a battle that should not be seduced by a small child at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest-alongress from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said German law would "give the powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgenic receptors are faulty, Katie's female features have developed.
He's got a vagina, but he's got no uterus and ovaries.
She is now married to 29-year-old Katie and works as a child psychiatric intern as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is barren, he hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some room to make no hurry to make their decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and think about it, and it gives them time before they write "man" or "woman."
In this respect, all is well - you raise your child and love it.
You have an amazing child and rejoice in it.
You don't have to rush into an operation that's irrefutable.
"It brings the opportunity to involve the child in the decision-making and takes away the anxiety that binds the parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child decides which sex they identify with more - and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The bird was airlifted from the drilling platform in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was flown to the coast after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the Black Sea and released back into the wild.
One of the chins was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after he had previously been treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue centre until he recovered.
The operational centres of Colin Seddon said: "This hut was probably migrating from northern Europe as it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea."
Apparently, he ran out of power and found refuge on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added, "He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted for help."
By the time the Corebe was released, he was in good shape and well.
Znojmo starts with stadium reconstruction
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders to carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city's stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Together with several others, it is a testament to the volcanic activity in the Low Jesenik at a recent (corologically point of view).
The last eruptions were still at the start of the Quarter.
Looking from a greater distance, at the top of Uhlířský vrch, the striking whitewashed plastered baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of the Auxiliary, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church was not preserved.
Shortly after the church was completed, the avenue was planted from the four rows of the lime, about 1 km long.
The cross road on Uhlířský vrch is the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
At the fifteen stops are wooden sculptures made by the local art carver František Nedomlel.
He used various tree species from the Low Jesenik region.
Similarly, the pedestals from the rock from the area form an interesting geological exposition.
Each stop also features the sponsor's name.
The coalmining hill is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the readings from the radiometric measurements of the age are somewhat different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than Great Roudny (old age of 3.3 million) and older than Venusia volcano (artistic 0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born in an explosion.
In it, it disveled a significant amount of volcanic ash, along with fragments of rock from the bedrock, which were fired by reddish-brown.
At the end of this phase, lava leaked to the surface - today it is a layer of a porous basalt of up to 13 metres powerful.
The second eruption disgorged red, brownish and, in places, black tuffs.
Their layer is mighty up to 50 metres and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the tuffs, the striking volcanic bombs are up to 1 metre in size. The second eruption was also topped with the outburst through the lava.
At the end of the activity, the volcano leaked the lava, which today forms up to 50 m of the mighty layer of the slag-like basalt.
Volcanoes, which alternate the ejection of volcanic ash with lava outlets, are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they were given the name stratovignan.
The original volcanic cone was gradually being erosioned.
However, it was only threatened by the mining of rock in the quarry on the southern side.
The most intense mining took place here in 1953 - 1962.
Tuffas were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Mining was halted under pressure from experts and the public to maintain this unique place.
The problem, however, is in the porosity and little coherence of the rocks, which quickly weather, crumble and slide down the slope.
The quarry is disappearing quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can reach Uhlířský vrch by the green tourist sign from Bruntál, or from Silesian Kočov.
Automobilists can use an unpaid parking lot at the beginning of the lime alley, where the short nature trail begins.
A drunk doused the house with gasoline: He threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
Tensions were rising, fear escalating.
The man threatened to set the house on fire.
As a result, all available police patrols in the area went to the scene, as did a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire department.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene, trying to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
A SWAT team had to enter the house, discharging the man and handcuffed him.
The aggressor then ended up with a checkup at the Mladá Boleslav hospital, from where he was taken to an alcohol lockdown.
Firefighters eventually covered the house with gasoline with sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to the people, all pets were also rescued from the house.
The man did not listen to the police negotiator, so the squad went to him.
Anger at the verdict handed down over the outlaw of the Bali bombing plotting
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing responded in a verdict passed over the last of the outlaws who were brought to justice and said that Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for compiling the explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
In 15 years, he could be paroled.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of a mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other counts of terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded life in prison, even though it could have insisted that the man with the nickname "Demolition man" (the bunar) be given the death penalty thanks to his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastating attack launched by Patek and other outlawers nearly a decade earlier.
Tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should be following in the footsteps of the others.
To the AAP, Mrs. Corteen said, "He should be put in front of a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I won't see more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when it was 12. On October 2002, a powerful charge set off shortly after 11 p.m. indoors parked in the van parked.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier the suicide bomber had detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month and, while being kept alive, he "died" for doctors three times.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should suffer the same fate as the three other members of the Jama Islamic terrorist cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keep him alive... There's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years for killing 20 and injuring hundreds of others isn't that much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He avoided arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where, less than four months later, US forces killed former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish a link between the Southeast Asian and Al-Qaeda terrorist groups.
"He did not marry voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he had felt no regret for how much grief he had caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year, which will include the Bali and Australian ceremonies.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the judgment.
Pope Francis to appoint the first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis 22. in February, it will first appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church, after the Pope, and are the ones who vote for the Pope, so that Francis will establish his first group of men to help select his successors.
He is now 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he is no longer able to participate in the election of the Pope – the group shrinks to 120 voting cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Partter Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a gathering of current cardinals known as a consensual standard would be held ahead of the new cardinals' promotion.
"Pope Francis has decided to give his decision to convene the February Consistor in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said the number of voting cardinals was likely to drop by February.
He said the Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as he needed to rise to 120 again, and as many cardinals in excess of the age of 80, as many cardinals as he wanted.
The consistorium next year will be significant because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain focus on Europe for Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope has made his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that these cardinals would be asked by the Pope for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is the absolute novelty.
Valero said that the pope traditionally elevationsed bishops from the big places as cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprise - so we don't know who he's appointing."
Announced series of Race Series
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an intercom.
The choice is for improved brakes, a service package to provide access to the Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between the different races.
Drew Bowler, the technical director at Bowler Motorsport, said, "Customs to the races coming to the Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable path to world class races.
We are pleased to offer this journey in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare the contestants for the harshness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week of Strings of Autumn
The saxophone gipple and jazz scene legend, Wayne Shorter, will dot next Wednesday for the 18th annual Strings of Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform in the Grand Hall of the Lantern on 6 November together with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation by the PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra will feature a track Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, as evidenced by the fact that the Prague concert at Strings of Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he has worked with extends from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
He also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese native Joe Zawininel on his musical journey, with whom they gave the direction of a new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the past thirteen years, he has performed in particular with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
A kind of after-party after the festival will still be the club's Spotlight night, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD.
Alongside the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Czech audience will be presented with the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronica and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation of the Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis demonstrated exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of pronouncements, they sent out planes, hitting the target and returning.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of the confused and grandiose, the actions of Obama's unmoved Syrian politics.
And the most satisfying of the entire attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't be fooled by the media by their claims that the "Syrian base" or "delivery for Hezbollah" was bombed.
I recently wrote here about the fact that while US assistance to the secular rebels in the country remains only on the rhetorical plane, so Russia happily continues to supply arms to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles unloaded at the port of Latakia that was the target of an Israeli air raid.
Clear message.
And note, Israel once again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, though it should be the other way around, according to popular online theories.
The U.S. government honored 2 members of the Spacal Forces, probably the Delta force.
It had not been suspected until now that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the American consulate in Bengazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city is known, I think they were members of the CIA's secret squad that is made up of ex-military.
There has long been speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA's elsewhere.
It is clearer now.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (it is on one of the likes of SEALs who were killed after being hit by a mortar) is rather surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of a U.S. squad in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the attack in Bengazi, they volunteered for the hit and, together with five private contractors, shot their way to the CIA compound in Bengazi.
The Obama administration is boasted by the fact that during that attack the commandos were not officially deployed officially and whole, and that there was simply a hesitation to do what.
The commando commander, so without orders he will probably release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that there are not one-time but permanent American commandos, CIA agents, and private contractors are operating in the country is quite interesting information.
And that's because until recently, there was no such thing officially admitting, and even now they're only talking about a NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is a good thing that the US is half-heartedly trying to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although to resolve the nationwide situation, it would take a much bigger help.
The last site of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not long ago, the media were almost praised by Iran's air force for prosecuting American drones.
But little is known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to be able to discover your drone in the airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
But if the Iranians are discovered by a drone in an international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it was that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chased by an American drone in the international space above sea level, when the first sharp deployment of the American super-fighter F-22 Raptor in history occurred.
He flopped under Phantom to visually verify his gear without Phantom registering him on the radar or simply noticing it, and then suddenly appearing by him and challenging the Iranian pilot to return home, he obeyed without grumbling.
No wonder when the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare to Raptor.
Court blocked order on the procedure for stopping and searching the police department of NY
The Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday blocked a court order calling for changes to the program to be stopped and searched at the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
A second U.S. appeals federal court said Judge Shira Scheinlin's decision would be postponed until the appeal decision the city filed.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program to stop and question people.
The city has challenged its conclusions and its corrective regulations, including the decision to assign supervision to the police department to help the police department change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge had to be removed from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judges, by not acting as a judge on the request to avoid the appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements to which she openly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to halt and search people.
It has established an independent oversight to oversee the main changes, including reform of procedures, training and surveillance, and order the launch of a pilot programme to test camera worn on the body in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the naming method of preservation of the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral reasons for the city's appeal are scheduled to be held sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of stopping and searching people has been criticised by the ranks of civil rights defenders.
In some form, stopping and searching people has been in place for a number of decades, but recorded searches under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically risen to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, most of them being black and Hispanic.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are among the minorities, drafted a lawsuit that had a group lawsuit.
Supporters of changes to the Permission and Search Programmes by the Police Department in NY claim that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and influence how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but it will not solve the wider problem of the police force under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand people over the last decade.
The judge noted that she had not ended the practice of stopping and searching the people that was constitutional, but she had reformed the way the searches were put in place by the police department at NY.
CDC Center issues schools guidelines on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in case of child-based food allergies at the school.
This is the first set of such directives to be issued by the US government, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One of the 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The directives contain information for schools on how the teaching staff and the staff are aware of child food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline rush - the most commonly used is the EpiPen automatic injection - to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislators have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more simply.
The report also contains a list of the typical symptoms occurring in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone's been injected into my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "Itching my tongue."
How Tipsport (not)graphes personal data.
More than a year ago, I did a registration on the Tipsport.cz website.
But I didn't finish it afterwards, because there was just someone at the branch who couldn't finish the registration from the internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration failed, then I moved in and thanks to that, my ID number changed.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told it couldn't be done because I have a different OP number, the address and that I just can't finish it and that I should ask for the data to be deleted and make a new registration.
So I did, and on 24.10.2013, I wrote in technical support that I was requesting the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
For that, a short day, she wrote me a technical support to finish the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of e-mails in technical support, where they eventually wrote after the 4th urgci 25.10. that the personal data was deleted at my request.
So one would think that he could make the new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I do not understand it has not been deleted - it is not a personal figure, but in the end they also excluded this).
So I used a different username and it jumped out to me that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that they said they deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When asked how it was possible to write back to me that the personal data was actually deleted on 25.10. and to send an email with the mistake.
I did that (at the beginning of the 15th hour) and on that they wrote back today that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that is why I cannot, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What does it matter that I have been contacting technical support for a week and I've been working out with them that it still can't be done.
What about the fact that if there was truth what they claim (as it is not) could not be registered by anyone with the same name or date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, I actually registered in the 1 p.m. on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictitious e-mail and a phone number and wonder of wonders, a page appeared to me that they sent me a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is this possible if it is not possible to register in the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds the registration to the e-mail and phone number and the data just didn't take out as he claims.
So I once again conveyed this technical support that they are simply lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they are writing) because what they write is not true.
I documented several screens that the problem with the registration was already before 31.10. so the "fake" registration simply does not affect this.
Tipsport wrote off a stark sentence for me - I'm sorry, but by the fact that you're re-registered, we can't check your claim.
And he stopped the communication.
Respectfully, it repeats the same sentence over and over again that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
Nor can they accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the email and so it did not actually take place.
So, in summary, Tipsport has not only failed to delete the data as he claims, but he is also lying when he says otherwise.
What makes it even worse is that it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer's side.
By the way, after the launch of this matter on my personal blog, things started to move a bit, and from the Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter was being passed on to the screening and I would be informed (after a week of urgencies and arguing and warning about the same error).
We are sorry to kill, but we are innocent, the Khmer Rouge leaders plead
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rougna hierarchy, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge, which rebuilt on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism from 1979, they lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunishment, disease, torture, torture, and executions of more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population of the time.
This commander of the notorious S-21 prison was given a life prison sentence for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had no idea what the true extent of the killing was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything and thus intervened and rectified the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think that I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said that he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadres to "walk people to the mistreat or kill them, to deny them food or commit genocide."
But he did admit to "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Bin Sivla, 55, who lost eleven relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP that she could not accept Nuon Chea's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be exonerated."
"He's not caring for others," she said.
"If he didn't give orders, his subordinates wouldn't kill," she added, noting that the leaders of the Khmer Rouge were "worse than the monsters."
The "Foreign Minister" of the Khmer Rouge Regime, Ieng Sara, was also to be court, but he died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then-Famed Social Affairs, was founding an insolvency in the process of dementia in September 2012.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, died in 1998.
A fantastic ice-cream that shines in the dark?
The British entrepreneur has made the first ice cream to shine in the dark - using a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea when he read a scholarly treatise on jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically produce the protein that causes lumines.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer's tongue - increasing the pH level of the protein and then causing radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, which is why the more you lice, the brighter the brighter.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" (soon me, I taste great), says: "It's an amazing fabric, but when it comes to making, we're at the beginning, so for GBP 200 you get about 2g of this fabric."
The protein we use in the ice cream is in response to your language at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice cream starts to shine.
We've tested it over the last few months and seems to be a great idea for Halloween to celebrate because it's causing this fantastic, shining effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the lumines of jellyfish are four times more expensive than gold.
And so every scoop costs me about £10.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unconventional flavours of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, it's impossible because of the refractor of light caused by the ice crystals that make the ice cream, but I'm counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice creams use the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Ski resorts want to make it cheaper for families with children
Oil price plummets further to $96 a barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high inventories were offset by a report that showed a boost to China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The US oil marker for December deliveries fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in European e-commerce trading on the New York trade exchange on the New York trade.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents, and it was 5.8 percent short of October.
Rich oil reserves have been weighing on the price in the past few weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that US stockpiles have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, stocks have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese manufacturing came to the impetus for more demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after the growth that rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Brent crude oil towered oil, also used by US refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the International Trade Exchange in London.
Martin Doktor on problems with the Sochi Olympics: Communication with the Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth are indicated by a slight smile, and then he exhales, "It's challenging."
Cooperation with the organizing team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
What was at the last Olympics, we can forget.
"Nothing works the same way," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A number of things work more slowly and not as accurately.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of the invoices, they are relatively quick, not so much from the point of view of delivering information on essential things.
Perhaps we have been lecturing from them for three months to give us how the individual villages will be officially designated so that we can do a whole lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating with this thing.
They're still communicating in a number of things.
Is the Olympic Village at least already built?
But it's not a disastrous state anymore.
A month ago, we used to walk in empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean, they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just basic concrete, that's what the state was a month ago.
But they still have time.
While there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26th as a vanguard, he will still smell glue.
And if they're late, what?
President Putin would you think he'd have him herded an army there?
That's what's going to happen.
Just to make it not, that the Olympic Village = Potemkin villages.
Rather, they are at risk of not making a trip, for example, and not finish the details.
Maybe they'll have the roads in such a state that we'll have to take our boots with us from the London Games.
But I believe they'll get it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are roughly 78, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the figure skaters are likely to be riding in the trio they went out.
No one has to doubt about speed skatinglist Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Still a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I shouldn't have gone there until January 26th.
What the houses in the Olympic Village will look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves on the subway so as not to believe just sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports, plus I am doing a normal agenda in the sense of communicating with the Sochi Organisational Committee.
Instead of a post-election sirloin booing stew
The October elections brought a bunch of losers rather than the winners.
These are not just parties that have not even made it to the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous governing parties (ODS, TOP 09) and, finally, the ČSSD because of its internal split.
Politicians served us a post-filled candle playout over the weekend for us.
The rally of the election was the Andrej Babiš movement, which promised voters to change the political style of governance to date.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party plays into the political (dismemberment) of President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported, or elected to the House of Commons.
The president may have lost a strategic lead over other politicians because of an unpleasant event, but he has a few ways to win him back - for example, by selecting a future prime minister.
While the ČSSD is moving away from the chances of winning the premiership in my eyes, they are getting closer to businessman Andrej Babiš.
Post-election developments are so far miles away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing ČSSD government supported by the Communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy is still better news.
Given the loud opposition of YES to get together with the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option of the coalition of ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies) is still the most likely option.
Given the split in the CSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak parterre in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be quite dismal for the CSSD.
The minority GOP government, composed with the "Net-Skinis" at the Castle, is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the CSSD participates will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may lead sooner or later to further divisions in the party.
So I ask myself: "Are we not naturally rushing to the next early election?"
Another election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the Yes vote.
The GOP's plans to introduce sectoral taxes, more substantial increases in income taxes, or the building of a state-owned bank have been hopefully passed.
The parties of the ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsvit, on the other hand, agree, for example, to support entrepreneurship, a sparing fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged people, to reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Friction surfaces occur most in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
But ANO now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition of ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL would be leaning rather to the right.
Which, in my view, is a better result than the left-wing tax program on everything that is still moving in the economy.
More recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
The reasons were given for corruption, the squandering of money for overpriced purchases and state contracts, tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the election results, it can be concluded that most citizens were comfortable with this condition.
That they didn't really mind and were actually satisfied with the state that was (the steal and debt of this state).
Otherwise, I can't explain to myself that there were 3,413,497 voters in the election, with 596 357 voters voting for TOP 09 39,4174 voters, in total, ODS voted for a total of 4,394 028 to support the original governing coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
When I add 1,016,829 GOP voters to the above parties, then with the old order (because all of the parties mentioned were involved in the "harvesting' and the indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the right-wing voters actually agreed to this state.
In fact, most voters have indicated that they are not in favour of punishing the culprits of the upstart and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think the GOP members who participated in it will work on the proper laws?
Is it even to help us?
Olomouc to open a public ice rink in the historic centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas and winter skating, Pavel Spálený, said that the preparatory work on the rink started on the 26th October and from Wednesday on the ice generator are in operation.
The ice layer is already seven centimetres thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has an area of 375 square metres, the stage took up 358 square metres.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two stalls with punch.
"We have extended the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stalls and almost the entire area of the podium is roofed so that the skaters can comfortably change," Spálený described.
The streets of Olomouc already commemorate the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the rink was installed for the repair of the Lower Square right in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed in the late summer, so the ice sheet could return to its original location.
People could skate for the first time right in front of City Hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice sheet then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be launched in the Upper Square a month before Christmas Eve.
Scientists have more enlightened how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Earlier research has shown that joyful dogs wag its tails wag its tails to the right (from the dog's point of view), while the nervous dogs waving their tails mostly to the left.
But now scientists are saying that other dogs can record and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgiio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said, "With men, it is well known that the left and right side of the brain have different links to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
We tried to observe the same in other species.
He added that, as is the case with humans, dogs are also the right side of the brain responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information about how dogs respond to the asymmetrical wagging of other dogs' tailings, researchers were monitoring the animals that followed films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail goes one way, and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, "We have scattered dogs' films about dogs - whether in the natural version or in the form of a silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were able to adjust the tail's movements and represent it more to the right or the left."
When the animals saw the otherwise bland dog move the tail to the right (from the view of the tail-wronged dog), they remained perfectly at ease.
But when she recorded the tail's filming, predominantly to the left (again, from the point of view of the tail-wronged dog), their heart rate increased and the animals seemed insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they have to take and which they do not have to look out for.
He said: "If you encounter dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behaviour and movement to the right breeds less friendly behaviour, you will respond on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog conduct expert John Bradshaw, a university lecturer at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side was important for dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left as they watched the aggressive dog, and to the right when they were looking at a cheerful dog.
And in another scholarly treatise from the University of Victoria University in Canada, he said, "The dog's robot was more likely to be introduced to the dogs when it wagered its tail to the left than to the right, when they became uncertain - quite the opposite of the Italian study."
The difference, he says, can be because dogs in these various studios did not exchange animals in films or dog robots as quite as dogs.
He explained that a study could help about how dogs respond to real dogs.
"Although in the case of many different mammals there are strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand why their tail goes one way on one side and sometimes on the other.
RBS suspends two foreign currency dealers
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royalinian Federal Scorchate is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that global investigations by control authorities concerning suspicious monetary market machinations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the competent authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion of USD changes hands every day.
The two traders in question would be the first RBS employees suspended in the context of an expanding investigation, which is the response to the LIBOR-manipulation scandal (London's interbank interest rate).
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our relentless search is continuing this matter and we are cooperating fully with FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event said that RBS had given financial conduct records of e-mails and quick messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader to the British authority's financial behaviour.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been released from his current position as European foreign currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European chairman of trading for cash in Citi, took a holiday this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former head of the currencies' business at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders has been charged with any offence.
Mr Usher's Quick News group included the Barclays and Citigroup bankers, said the insiders of the event.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against one of its employees, after the Swiss supervisory body Finma announced that it had investigated suspicious foreign currency market machinations in several Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority, Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining the claim that these bankers have conspired to move the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combed with years-old quick messages and e-mails to find cases of misdemeanours.
News of investigations has alarmed traders in the area, which was one of the largest profit-making engines for investment bank closures in recent years, but which was disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by claiming that it is essentially impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign currency market, but high-ranking traders say this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily foreign currency trading, the dislocation of liquidity between different trading and banks to increase the use of their own internal platforms meant that "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired from its trading firm's stock trading department this week, which caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the relevant authorities and cooperates with their control authorities.
"We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved," said Credit Suisse.
He negotiated the government with both Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babiš.
The People's Party won fourteen deputies in the election, or only a third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to argue with the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who debuted the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002, and 2006 for the People's Party.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
It will probably be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a whole new party.
"The experience was minimal then," Kasal estimates of how this year's talks will unfold.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35), from the town of Tiptree in Essex, was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to accusing himself of driving carelessly and inattentively.
He received seven points on his account, as a result of which he received a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to reimburse the cost of £90 and a £100 premium for the accused.
Sleep: I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have juice, lust and enthusiasm
For Prospal, the family has always come first, which is why he wants to submit to her full submission at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and he'll extend his career, or he'll finally quit hockey.
"I want to play the role of daddy and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite the fact that he is a renowned worker who will never cheat anything.
Despite the fact that he always lets his heart out on the ice and can pull his teammates off.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still there," he says firmly.
He may see it, reportedly wanted by the New York Rangers, who failed to make the season, and they have injured two cornerbacks - forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What's your arrival at the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in dwelling on it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post saying I should be signed, but that's all.
Nowhere was it added that it had indeed happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Didn't you even get back from the club?
Such communication in the NHL is daily.
That's the idea of getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When, say, a player gets injured or someone can't do it and the team doesn't step up.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get that contract.
But in New York, that's the circumstances like this, don't they?
The injured is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make the start of the season, so there's some chance, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always there.
The second thing, though, is you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't gotten one yet.
Unfortunately, that is the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you in anticipation that something might work out after all?
I've got the expectations since 5. July, when the free-agent market opened up in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remind yourself?
I'm going to Tampa for the kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sunshine and see you again.
Do you have any planned program?
That's because I'm the father and the husband, and that's where it all comes from.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of daddy and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday Vasik has two hockey matches, that is a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking of doing this in a full-time quotes?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This, too, could happen.
I tried it out three years ago when I missed 50 fights for knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very, very much.
It gets to that stage one day that all the goals, victories and passes don't make up for what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Let's have whatever you want to do.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
As I am a hockey player, the first place - in addition to the family - is a sporting achievement.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is based on.
My children, I mean, sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there and so on.
And we'd love them to continue this trend.
Because what we're going to tell ourselves, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else entirely.
That's the chance we should offer.
So are you planning on staying in America permanently?
We'll practice it like we do.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia in the Czech Republic and around České Budějovice.
And in the winter, back in Tampa or where our steps take us.
It's perfect being warm all the time.
I've been extremely lucky in my life.
You could say I went to meet him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took away a lot of things I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I could choose where to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who crave this one to choose what to do and how they will live.
How long will you have the will toil, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. That desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell you how much longer it's going to stay.
It's impossible to plan.
So you could say you'd wait this season to see how it goes and then decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage where I'm going from the day.
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasies about extraterrestrial life on earth are not themes that the American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would pitch casually.
In the conception of his quartet, which will be completed in the grand hall of the Prague Lucerna by this year's edition of the Strings of Autumn festival on 6th November, everything is related to everything.
The parting of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are supposed to play what they are experiencing.
They treat music as a completely improvised chamber affair, and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, the newly eighty-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-time Grammy winner, a former teammate of Miles Davis and, now, arguably the largest living jazz saxophonist - is not reluctant to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of eighty, I came to the conclusion that it was best to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything and then they are disappointed when things go differently," Shorter says.
Jagr joked: Goal from the breaker?
He got the puck in the defensive zone and was never caught again.
He also converted the leak after a quick forehand loop.
Jaromir Jagr scored like this against Tampa on Wednesday night, then commented on the 119th NHL goal on the social networking site Facebook on Thursday night.
"After viewing this video, my agent, Petr Svoboda, contacted the director of Czech Railways and asked him if I would be interested in advertising for their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" Jagr wrote at the outset.
They say we're a lot alike in type.
I guess I'll have to quit my night practice so I don't accelerate any more.
"I'm afraid the defense minister could call in afterwards and he'd like to advertise for the jets!" he added with the smiley faces.
In addition, New Jersey claimed its second win in a row.
"Above all, you've noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrova is working," concluded Jagr.
Brutal murder of senior citizen on Dec. will be re-fired by regional court
The regional court acquitted the 25-year-old Slovak and 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men pleaded not guilty.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the High Court overturned the regional decision and returned the matter for consideration.
He declined to comment on the rationale that the judge had not yet received the decision.
According to the indictment, the teenagers ambushed a 79-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a harrowing death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled him, beat him and kicked him all over his body, and also the metal object, apparently with a gas pistol, inflicted about three dozen blows in the head.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as fractures to the skull, swelling of the brain or a cerebral hemorrhage to which he succumbed at the scene.
The teenagers reportedly took about 3,000 crowns from the house and jewellery worth about 14 thousand crowns.
According to the regional court, they were the only, moreover, only circumstantial evidence against the defendants' scent traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established in the sense of the legal instructions.
The scam marks from the crime scene and other items coincided with the defendants in more than a dozen cases, but the police initially treated them as material and not scent trails.
In addition, there were certain errors in the handling of them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was not established without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
The dead elderly man with a smashed head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
The violent death was not even drawn to the called emergency services.
It was only after a few days that the forensics officers were contacted by Olomouc doctors, who discovered the hallmarks of a violent death during the autopsy.
Police could no longer work with all the traces from the scene, which had been cleaned by the relatives.
No DNA was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradišťsko.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was finally confirmed by the Delhi High Court last year.
The man, he said, was the head of an organized group of six teenagers who were responsible for the jewellery store robbery.
The robberies happened in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of the Svenir in Slopnt.
The younger of the accused of murdering the elderly is living in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Will Czech Television ever do without signing events?
She set foot in the era of President Zeman with a legendary ashtray scene, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that gather the documents of the castle retinue.
In the past, the traditional influence of such an Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík was not documented in this way, let alone to sign it.
True, the editors stood up for the management.
The cases described, however, do not answer the question of where such an affluence of some journalists to the yeomen is taken from - whether it is a response to a direct order or, not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of out-of-the-case empathy.
And, assuming general rottenness, one cannot forgive the question of whether other, equally unscrupulous, power interests that have yet to be given the opportunity to change their circumstances in television can be sought.
The truth is for those who say that in developed countries, the spectacular attempts to intervene politicians to intervene in the broadcast do not come to the market.
But the truth is also that this does not mean that complaints to public media do not exist there.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they mainly criticise what they see as the tenderness inherent to them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have simply not reached this civilisation stage yet and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps, in a country that thinks of itself as being the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about evil politicians and good journalists are spent more comfortably than the more complicated descriptions of a messy situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings comes up against each other.
As crowds of experts gathered in Cardiff to show off horses to fight for the Tribal of the Year award, it was clear to all that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet in school and only a few months ago took his first steps, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly troop, fused through three rounds to eventually win the grand prize and leave behind 30 protracted adult rivals.
This inseparable pair - with the same height - were praised at the annual competition operated by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry, near Cardiff.
He faced the gentlemen and ladies in the elegant hats, tilted his beret at a cheerful angle, and had his two-year-old Toffee paraded around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural ability to control the horses, far exceeding his age.
And Toffee won the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee in March for his third birthday and has been practicing with this Shetland pony a day ever since.
His mother, Donna (30), said, "Fenton and Toffee are working together brilliantly."
They didn't have much hope, but in the end they left with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and complete strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt, Sharon Howells, who has been showing off her horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded."
He ran across the sand along the length of the arena and, although he looked so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors and a farm and was in charge of two chickens.
Considering the way he started, he'll be back at the Rope of the Year competition again, and I'm sure he'll do the right thing.
A spokesman for the annual horse-treating contest said, "Fentons are only three, but he already knows how to control the pony."
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork between the pony and the one guiding him is – and Fenton and Toffe were the best at the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by the delightful outfit, he really fell in with him.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a snitch in the US intelligence service, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, who was forwarded to the media by the MP in Berlin on Friday, reads: "Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, the government continues to treat the opposition like deserters and seeks to criminalise political speeches with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defence."
But to speak the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr Snowden said he believed that supporting the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the charges of criminal offences against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
Tensions in the US-German relationship began to rise when it was claimed that the NSA had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who is running a parliamentary panel overseeing the news bulletin, said that if there was any opportunity to interview Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and that relations with the US would be completely destroyed," should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a picture of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
On their trip to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to the former NSA contract lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left one day.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "failure" there, the member of parliament said.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said he had faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the world's reaction to his "act of political expression" had given him courage.
Citizens in the whole and senior officials – including those in the United States – assessed the revelation of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "as far as the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved."
Not to be balked in hatred
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After reading, he lived, but did not write, published VACLAV KAHUDA (1965) a new novel, The Darkness, the Present.
That it will not be a slim volume is suggested by the number of pages comparable to his most famous work Houština (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahud, another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl - confessed.
What did it go to say, after twelve years of silence, to write a novel?
I did it - not to choke on the hatred.
To see around you still new and new clones of that folk pettiness of human, young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavours.
I'm not talking about us elders, faces ruined by helpless lust, the rowd soul, and the opposite-handed by ideologues who try to sell their "product" with the air of a small saleable whores.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my jubilant friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from my life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks, and then I read my books by the lamp at the end of the day.
You're talking about feeling frustrated, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The break came a long time ago, at about the age of ten.
It didn't have a name then.
Well, that's what I did was live.
There's a quiet boy still surprised in there.
I see more of a solitary practitioner, each in their tornado of anxieties.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm attending to this giant, thousands of years of moving of the life system on this planet - the birth of the elusive future.
That immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game where, along the path of trial-error, more and more generations of beings are created, creating some superhuman, formal intelligence in the billiards of interactions per second.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-transmission, or rather, the dialogue that is conducted by the right and the left half of the brain, occasionally floats to the surface and is shaped into a book.
Like periods of peace, they are laced with quietly sleeping metastases of wars that may wake up one day - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the mute avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I do nothing, one day I'll be quietly overwhelmed.
It's a set of questions that the brain has formulated and asked of the layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness."
Neokortex, a grey cortex, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient tree ringthongers of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, asks the serpents, seeks the answer in the flight of the birds, raises his gaze to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heaven over me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Relatively, you often comment on the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrochemical links all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has endured.
This forest logically and emotionally displayed and branching trees of information, memory registers, the brain uses in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to a constantly changing present, in a relentless effort to try to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overload disturbances.
By analogy - as if you were "fell up" with a PC, from a language emulator's program and a foreign language translator's program, you would have got confused first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarches, ended up with a darkly green-glowing Biosu screen, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about - I am talking about a psychospirital crisis.
You mention it often - why do you regularly take this particular kind of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the doposites of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there will be a breakthrough.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He stared into the abyss for so long until the abyss looked into him."
A pure feeling - that one is lost if all hopes disappear, mentally "average" and a new quality.
And why do I care personally?
I'll answer the parables.
Once one had fallen into the pool and drowned, the days, the months and the summers, he was drowning all the time and reading, and the books had taught him to swim - to live, that is.
He became a "diver."
Perhaps someone's sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal's lyrics once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, of the particular person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it a consciousness, another super ego, but I think it was best characterised by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else-this reader is involved directly in the process of word and phrase formulation."
From early youth he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nemo, ran around the Shadows in the dark streets.
In the end, in the end, behind all the branches of the authors and their messages, is: "The sun of the clear worlds of the various Karl Hynek Mácha's clear worlds."
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the backbone that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, after all, after years, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are in fact "life" or, rather, "worlds."
They are encoded in the characters of the letters, they bear the experience, the history of the regions of each language.
Whenever we can bring them to life if we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It is, in a way, something forbidden to be divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the book is published, you - as it are so - await you in a chain of author readings.
I remember you used to like reading.
Will you be happy to do it again, or do you feel differently years later?
Today, I'd rather just tell the story.
And what did I find in the process?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic character - they are unobtrusive, they don't draw attention to themselves too much, they have friendly radiated, you don't feel lonely with them.
I will give you an example - in the town of Červený Kostelec lived (and I hope he still lives) one curly book-buy bookseller (a name is a convenient Cervenka), a cheerful sidekick and a good girl's bull.
In one leech, he introduced me to the individual articles of the readers chain of my book Houština.
I stared into their eyes, and then I was shown a romped, read-readspirited copy of my book.
Embarrested, I put down the already-read sausage and wept briefly in a manly.
We all stood there silently, swaying and teasing drunkenly with emotion.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't take it, and he sprang up headfirst out the window into the snowdrift.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night landscape and, with the lucky rabies of the quasi-fuesque, the aching soul of the countrymen, and the homesickness of the backstre patriots - howling and braying like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is, formally and content, different from the previous ones.
Is it also true of the text, the Width, the Present?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about a land behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his new Suchodol, Ivan Bunin puts the words of an old Russian fable in the mouth of the people's healer: At the Sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujanu.
There's a dog, a grey chest on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps we were devils in hell a long time ago and drew - what role we would play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or will you leave it back on a free influx of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Brezina.
Writing is a marvellous way of dialogue.
Something of the vast and unctuous, similar to the movement of the continents on the planet, is influenced by our wills from such depth and in such a wide range that it completely transcends our horizon - and so, with absolute commonness, we act in the exact terms of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mingle, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes a malfunction happens and we give in to compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disturbances, standing on the ocean coast of the unconscious, and a leaky sack made from a dirty handkerchief catches the tides of warm wind.
I have to write to be human.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, it will be necessary to study at least one of Shakespeare's plays, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include "hidden text" to encourage deeper reading;
The combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to have a graduation certificate on the language and will be encouraged to select English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education is expected to issue a new curriculum tomorrow for English and Mathematics – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other crucial items are expected to be made next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exam's exam, it will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with the new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our examine system to regain the trust of society," and that we need to insist that the graduation exam is "more challenging, ambitious and stricter."
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia devote an average of 143 hours a year to mathematics and about 138 in Singapore.
Although there will be no official request to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said the comprehensive maths graduation exam – coupled with a greater emphasis on the subject in the scoreboards – is likely to encourage schools to provide extra classes.
The curriculum will focus more on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not the one with cancer in the ČSSD
Ahead of the election, the long-froning controversial was on full display between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava-based ČSSD.
It all came to a head when the Mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, went to court over the undemocratic formation of female candidates.
Still, the players in the case did not want to comment too much to harm the party before the election.
But now the votes of the electorate are numbered.
The leadership of the Ostrava-based ČSSD called on the Mayor of Ostrava to leave the party on Monday evening and will probably push for him to lose his post as well.
But Petr Kajnar wants to fight on.
What the controversy is all about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview with the Journal.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The CSSD was certainly counting on a much better result.
Did it hurt her in our country to have disputes between the party in the media before the election?
I imagine that a social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it fits the state of the CSSD now.
It is a party that has its internal problems, is mentally ill and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the CSSD?
The ODS has been going through the decline for some time, I think, and unfortunately, things like this are happening in a social democracy.
It is the case that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their prebends with the ODS, have moved to the people of the CSSD and are influential in them.
It then has to do with the fact that the offices of the Ostrava Municipality are visited by the police and collect computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not only made up of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily of their own good.
The CSSD is divided into two implacable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Haškovci and Sobotkovci.
But that, too, had been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a precursor to what was happening in Prague.
The Hashk's wing gradually filled its positions so that it could then, after the election, create a situation that would weaken the Sobotka wing.
One is in politics in a situation where you sometimes have to compromise.
But everyone has some internal boundaries where the compromises can't be made anymore, and that's the case with me.
Originally, I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing within the party, I made a deal with Luboš Zaoralek to try to get on the regional ticket to strengthen the Sobotka wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But Hashk's wing gave it a mark.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Hašek?
Slávek Sobotka, in my opinion, is a man who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and, to a certain extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I confess I have not heard anything like it from the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only start sacking the party chairman.
This is a power struggle, regardless of everything and against the statutes of the party.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has now done in Prague, he has ended his political career.
How did you feel about the fact that the Ostrava-based leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you on the ballot.
Political parties are based on a competition to see who is placed by their members.
The contest should for the most part be based on the program visions and the capabilities of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have much capability or vision, but a political party is a lift to the money they would not receive elsewhere.
The problem is when these people come to the fore by breaking the rules without scruffy, breaking the rules.
They are making their practices out of the political parties of the mafia and, in my opinion, they are also breaking the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to consider whether a Kajnar has a political future.
It is important that the parties start to respect the statutes.
That is why, before the elections, did you file a motion for a preliminary injunction against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava is consolidating its power by the fact that the organizations that do not comply with it can abolish, purposefully establish new organizations, gradually throw away inconvenient party members.
One example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bednarek from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then rescinded the resolution to exclude him.
This shows that, while seeking to uphold the party's statutes through the courts is the last resort, it is the only option at the moment when the other ways and the supervisory authorities within the CSSD have ceased to function.
The Ostrava-based ČSSD leadership, headed by MP Adam Rykala, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, is keen on this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, they get the vote, and for those votes they consolidate their power in the party.
Going back to the past, everything that might have happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could call me a man who gives money where he doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought the property, which is of strategic value to it.
So how do you see it further with your continued presence as mayor?
The district committee has already invited me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the CSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Catch the Thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I don't see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy who would initiate and enforce, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many development things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than getting in the way of others to make their way to the places they want.
Will you still be fighting these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, then political parties must also function well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively run the state if they can't run themselves.
So I'm not thinking of leaving the GOP now, because I think the one who causes cancer in this party is not me, but these people who are trying to drive me out.
We want to show that Plzeň still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been doing well in the lead recently, Viktoria Plzen's defender or midfielder, František Rajtoral, has a form that earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He is also flanked by shooting, he is active, after a tackle on him a penalty kick was ordered in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached the final two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but in the end they took only one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team will break the unpleasant streak in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we know how to win.
"I believe we will beat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is preparing carefully for a tough match with the Saints, who play attacking football.
Everything is heading towards the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative is attracted to the Doosan Arena stands.
Plzeň's last matches have not worked out as they would have liked, but the word crisis is rejected by the Victory defender.
That's the way football is, sometimes you're in good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," the West Indies defender.
The Victory team will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's on Friday night and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to both Zeman and ODS.
I have repeatedly called in open letters in recent months with open letters to students, educators and the management of secondary schools in several regions to defend the academic freedoms before the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman at the schools.
I was seeing more or lesser success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who turned down a lecture by the honorary president of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received remorse in the form of non-invitation in the form of not being invited to the celebration of the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer so brave and made it possible to visit Miloš Zeman: University of Technology in Brno, Gymnasium Hladnov in Ostrava, University of Economics in Ostrava, Commercial Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now seeing a continuation of the promotion of policy at universities in Pardubice.
The newly elected ODS MP, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics at the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, finds it normal.
Professor, this is really not the same as staying as mayor of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the governors of the ČSSD, who are simultaneously challenging the office of MP and the governor and, like them, to degrade both professions?
You're telling people that you can handle both of these demanding left-back functions.
I know, we have here the example of Michal Hašek, who even manages several dozen functions at the same time.
But that's probably not exactly an example of the person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post to devote herself fully to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean, however, is that by the concurring functions you will violate the apoliticality of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current tenure in both posts as an advantage for the University.
But you will be able to help your school "you" without remaining the dean.
I think that a similar view to me and the rector Miroslav Ludwig will have a similar view, so will your students.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, you may be able to get it calculated by the voters at the next election.
And that may not last long.
John Kerry admitted: Spying went too far!
The United States has occasionally gone "too far" in the spying, the AFP told the AFP of US diplomacy, John Kerry, during a video conference between Washington and London.
But collecting information, according to the minister, was used to avert terrorist attacks.
The AFP's "First Reagniture from Washington" was echoed in the midst of a fierce controversy on both shores of the Atlantic because of the scandalous revelations about mass data surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which was also targeted by America's allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he mainly defended the previous practice.
The collection of information is necessary, he said, to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the US, the Madrid bombings in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, the buildings exploded and the people were murdered because we were able to be informed about the precipitations in time," Kerry pointed out.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone unreasonably far."
The American intelligence affair, which reportedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans had also watched the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their indignation, and some called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to prohibit or significantly restrict the surveillance.
The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) had been indicted before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children has learned that before the charges against child tutor Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Young Men's (YMCA) association in New South Wales were charged with child sexual abuse.
But it was said to the commission that in its opening statement to the commission, the association said that they had never dealt with the case of sexual abuse of a child in their organization.
Chief Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one of the YMCA employees was charged with child pornography offences, and another, when a gym teacher in Caringbah of the YMCA was convicted in 1991 for the sexual harassment of children in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the commission's adviser, that he knew of the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the initial YMCA statement was also inaccurate inwardly in stating that external audits were being conducted in the YMCA to praise the organisation as a leading supporter of children's rights.
Evidence submitted by the commission indicates that the YMCA was alerted to the fact that it received the second lowest of the four possible evaluations in an audit by the Ministry of Education and the Company in August of this year.
Mr Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the bottom-led management had failed from him alone to accept Mr Lord, without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Previously, this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys he had committed during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a breach of child safety by the Lord.
Members of staff gave evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, guarding them privately, leaving them sitting on his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because of her concern to her behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of the children's services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to him about."
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from staff, that they felt uncomfortable if they were to contact their superiors and report the deeds.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had clouded their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had given his view to the YMCA board in New South Wales that the "Jonathan Lord's case" was to say to the organisation that the staff had "notched any reports" and the council agreed to it.
Mr. Hare said the decision to let the staff sign the confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were made by the general manager for the children's services at the YMCA organisation, Liamem Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid disrupting the evidence, but it was "overly zealous" and poorly executed.
Child sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organization for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, vetting, working, training and staff management.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
President of the Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Greening Should Continue Savings
Since 2008, the Czech Construction Industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the lack of interest of the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measures, save substantial amounts of heating, but also of chances for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring the state more than 2,700 new jobs created.
In terms of the fiscal policy of the state, the leverage and multiplier effects are significant, it is also one of the most important pro-growth measures.
The Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government's resolution and is asking for the implementation of such steps that would allow the programme to continue to be continued in order to launch further calls within it.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological achievements on aircraft (but they are not allowed to call from their mobile phones)
Aeronauthor's passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from the gateway" - in addition to calling from their mobile phones - to read, gaming, watching movies, and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly awaited new rules released by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Passengers, however, are not to expect the changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary from airline to airlines, FAA administrator Michael Huerta told a press conference.
Airlines will need to demonstrate to the FAA administration how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and have updated the on-board crew training manuals and the facility storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already handed over the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in its statement.
Currently, passengers are required to disable their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft's doors are closed.
They cannot turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain logs his clearance.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane descends to land and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft, which have been modified to enable passengers to use the Wifi at a higher altitude, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards' Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are implemented safely - and we will work closely with the transport companies on this - it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
We're, frankly, tired of looking like "watchdogs."
However, surfing the internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will continue to be banned for under 3 kilometres of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aerial mode.
So there was still no Words with friends, an online scrabble-type game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was, as is well known, was thrown off an American Airlines flight because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored because of fears that they might hurt someone if they float around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using mobile phones are determined not by the FAA, but by the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport, a national security expert in transport at CBS News, said mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from the FCC data that they can cause the jamming of the transmitters in the air," Rosenker said.
The FAA's Obosa Advisory Committee to investigate this problem proposed last month to allow the government to use the wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, argue that there is no rightful security ground for the ban.
Restrictions are also finding it increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is pervasive.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers also forget the obligation to shut down their devices or ignore it.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the jamming of navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the technical achievement of the time.
New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also designed, and approved by the FAA administration to make it resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
The plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should be adapted for greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huertová said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio broadcasting than in previous generation devices.
For example, e-readers issue only minimal broadcasts when a site is turned.
But the broadcast is more powerful when the device downloads or sends data.
Among those who are pushing to loosen restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers, is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the airliner with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believed that the interference with these facilities was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only snippet messages from the pilots to support the fact that such devices could cause the cancellation of aerospace systems, and most of these reports were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device during low-visibility devices.
The travel industry group has welcomed these changes and is, in its view, a sensible procedure for the travelling public, using the technology to a large extent.
"We are delighted that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, managing director of the American Travel Association.
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that US espionage "did too far"
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the US defense stance on his surveillance programs, saying in an unprecedented admission that in some cases espionage "has gone too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as a "cargo" with the incendiary revelations about the NSA's espionage activities, which arose from the informant Edald Snowden, they acted as a "autopilot."
The information released sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, via a video-linked to the open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have been done from inertia, because that possibility was there, with reference to the Second World War, the difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, on 9/11."
He became the first high-ranking member of the US government to admit that American espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify it to the people, and is already conducting a thorough review to make sure that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this trial.
However, Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA sought good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We are addressing a new world in which people are willing to detonate themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to murdering and blowing people up and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from falling, buildings exploded, and people are not executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that US lawmakers were preparing to respond to foreign concerns about alleged American espionage and convinced Europeans that they needed to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week, and that he was worried about their threats to stop their participation in anti-terrorism organizations because they were disillused by the National Security Agency (NSA).
It is really important for the national-security interests of the US that Europe remains with us in the same boat, with a view to the joint efforts to combat terrorism, Murphy, a member of the democratic party and the presiding judge of the Senate subcommittee of foreign relations for European affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at the NSA's programmes.
News in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some of America's allies, even though the agency's chief executive said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected by the misunderstandings of the metadata that NATO's allies collected and shared with the United States,
Further revelations cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had tracked the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the Allies' espionage as necessary and said it was a routine matter on both sides.
In the middle of the uproar, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year, and he hoped that members of both parties and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to be involved are to be released.
He said the program was still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the aim of the trip was to help repair relations, he added that "well-intentioned educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to the espionage programs they have used for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realise the fact that we are not the only ones doing espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland as planned this weekend to respond to the animosity sparked by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as American surveillance activities.
For the words 'Mugabe is a limp donkey' no longer in danger of jail, court annulled the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be very careful about the talk in public about the 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and has been at the forefront since late in 1987.
Under section 33 of the Penal Code, the disrespect of the presidency was punishable by a fine of $100 to one year in prison.
"State representatives should not be keen to blame people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the court's decision will be appealed by the government, the British BBC reported.
The law was loudly outspoken by the Zimbabweans, among them Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist who ended up in prison in public with a "laugh-up donkey" with Mugabe's swear word.
In August, the prosecutor accused the 26-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with the face of Robert Mugabe as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting media freedom.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later prove to be false," said Deputy Attorney General Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to twenty years of jail.
"The existence of the law allowing the criminalization of someone for a false statement has a freezing effect on the right to express themselves freely," Malala added.
Not to mention that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
Small steps away from the country's dictatorship of a man, the country's man was in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraje to the premiership.
Nevertheless, the country continues to be plagued by the economic crisis and, until 2008, the world's highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government therefore abolished the national currency in its entirety.
Today, Zimbabwe is paid for only by currencies by other nations.
The impoverished economy is at the forefront of Mugabe's reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with the running of farms.
Young couple mature for living with parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the award to design a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the property itself sloping a bit.
The requirement went on to say that the house would be home to two generations who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house is on the corner of two streets and on a gently sloping property.
The architects therefore decided to place each household on one of the floors of the house.
"In making the design, we respected the family's volumes, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The parents' household is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognisable from the outside, as they differ in different final facade treatment.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was shaped with boards, the part where the office is, is plastered in white and the remaining elements have remained in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, which makes the interior of the house very entwined with the exterior.
The parents' household, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The intersection of the interior with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues up to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climb the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the house's interior.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall cascadingly through them.
It was by this that the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and to imprint something unique to it.
The young couple's household is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace by a glass wall with sliding doors.

The second floor is composed as one large open space that passes freely to the terrace, where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office on the top floor itself is conceived in a pure white and black combination.
The staircase is the dominant feature of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance, find themselves in the lobby and then climb up the stairs.
Fire crews came to rescue the lost puppy, which was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in the quarry
The Kokršřispři Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, trapped in a quarry, he was spotted by a man walking the dog.
Firefighters rappelled down the cliff face to rescue the dog from certain death.
The puppy was freed by fire crews who came to rescue him after somehow imprisoning himself on a dangerous outcropping in a stone firing tree 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days himself until he was extracted from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson (25), and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, they frantically searched for their lost dog and posted calls on social networks.
On Wednesday at about 2:15 p.m., a bristling dog walker saw the stranded Ruby on a curriculum in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheathaton fire station hurried to the scene and rappelled down to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to retrieve the rock.
The expert commander of the technical rescue team, Andy Clayton, said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall - 15 metres from the top and from the bottom.
He didn't flinch like a flinch - he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
He was then given the cookies.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.
The technical rescue team's expert commander, Peter Lau, said, "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a tour, and was fine in addition to exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was afraid to look at the rescue."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him back in his arms.
The vet said that if he had run out too much and collapsed, he would have fallen.
The firemen did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they were all just great.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The firemen were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
The refrigeration tower was burned in the industrial site of the ČKD in Prague at night
A large-capacity reservoir was on fire in the ČKD industrial site in Prague, according to the fire department, apparently a refrigerated tower.
"Firefighters were already riding out to the fire before 11 p.m. on Thursday, and they were still blazing the fire this morning," said Prague fire department spokeswoman Pavlína Adamcová.
The amount of pollutants in the air surrounding as measured did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the causes of the fire are as yet unknown.
Approximately five dozen firefighters arrived in the area in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire at a large-capacity reservoir, probably a cooling tower," Adamcová said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we extinguish with a transport line from the trucks," she said.
According to the server tn.cz, the extinguishing was complicated by a malfunctioning network of hydrants, so firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The firefighter's intervention commander issued a second fire alarm.
There are four in total, the most serious situations are declared a fourth.
Chemists also rushed to the scene to verify the level of hazardous substances that could reach the air in the fire.
"However, they did not focus on the air with a number of pollutants that would exceed hygiene standards," the fire department spokesperson said.
Rescue package worth $325 million for Tasmania health service
The federal government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the moribund health sector in Tasmania includes tough conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union was taking "accelerated measures" to avert the crisis caused by the island's aging population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided following government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilki.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgeries at the request of the patient.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic operations and cataract surgery, will help to eliminate the indebtedness.
There is also money at the open-access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to thoughts that leading clinicians told me to help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," Ms Plibersecková said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting and registration regime.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the Australian Union's money and report monthly where the additional funding was spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the state supplies the services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be of no use to do 'as long as genuine reform is not followed to lay a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system'.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for his response to his request for swift aid, which he first made in negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal auxiliary package can free the state's public health service from a critical state," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional procedures chosen will significantly overturn recent cuts.
The federal opposition's health advocacy spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes today's statement is just a "prash."
"The reason for this is that the Labour government has taken out $430 million from our health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes away almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union, which is donating $300 million to it, and pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Ms Pliberseck to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be issued for a higher bureaucracy.
On the Subway on the Bridge, the music plays
Transport Company hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the Music on the Subway project.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during the metro operation, is the A Bridge line at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Police specialists will probably be in the ghetto, to ease the tension
The ghettos in the Czech Republic should be used in the future by police specialists.
They'd spend up to half their errands here.
They would keep an eye on the order and solve problems.
By their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing the tension between people from the shantytowns and the residents of the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Interior Ministry is counting on this.
According to him, the situation in the country would be helped mainly by the "specialized provision of social housing."
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 shantytowns and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, mainly Roma.
The ghetto-adults were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
She was bugger usury.
According to experts in the problem localities, meanwhile, the number of people has added a hundred.
Relationships between their residents and others are escalating.
In several places there were anti-Romani marches.
The extremists were joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the Interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
A crucial condition, he said, is "the consistent application of equal access in law enforcement."
But this is said to be impossible to achieve without detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
A specialist would take errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest serving in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better address problems or offences.
"Thanks to the established confidence, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of infringements," the Interior said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive bonuses, at between CZK 500 and CZK 1,000 per month.
The introduction of special police officers to problem areas is to be covered by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (approximately around £15.5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations have started this year, and a detailed proposal is being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbours.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the report's authors said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to be given by analysis to determine the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year for these members after the end of the project.
According to the project's design, the selected police officers will first undergo an internship in Slovakia.
This training should be attended by five dozen members.
From these will come the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special education for police officers who will be active in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would mainly help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration, he said.
According to the Interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with specific rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
Social housing would have a higher standard, which would be comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to carry out an integration plan to be drawn up by social workers.
They would have to abide by the accommodation rules, take care of their health, send their children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would advance to a higher standard of housing.
The permeable housing system should work for at least 30 years, according to the Interior, until the next generation grows "in a prointegration-driven environment."
The social housing model is being prepared by the ministries for local development and work.
They're supposed to propose it by the end of the year.
Together with Barta, the inspection arrested the inspection and the anti-corruption police analyst
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening when the news was reported by the news server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon discovered that the case was taken up by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS), its people were to arrest Bárta in the center of Prague.
It took place outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection addresses cases where the accused are police officers, but its authority also applies to civil persons.
According to MF DNES, among those arrested is one of the anti-corruption police officers - the head of analysts and informatics Jan Petržílek.
He has worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej, however, declined to comment with the implication that the media must turn to GIBS on the matter.
But even her inspection spokeswoman, Radka Sandorová, did not want to say anything about the case, promptly referring to the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this inquiry in view of the protection of classified information," said the spokesperson of the prosecutor's office, Štěpánka Zenklová.
It can also be inferred from this unspecific response that the event took place, but is in a regime of secrecy that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
In a similar situation is Bart's lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba.
He told the media that he represented Barta "even in this matter," but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or uphold Bart's arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Petr Lessy.
He was promoted to the post by Barta, together with former VV President Radek John, who was at the head of the Interior Ministry.
The dispute, which sprawled up over this between ex-Prime Minister Petr Nečas and VV, even had to be dealt with by then-President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from on my person.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about the matter," Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
He was officially pushed by Radek John, but Barta was the party's real leader at the time.
Barta was now running for the Dawn election, with a seat narrowly locking him in the seat - by 175 votes.
Dawn's leader, Tomio Okamura, said he had no idea what it was.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our ticket and, as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomio Okamura," Okamura distanced himself from Bárta, who said before the election that he gave Bárta the space to run for the Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of the bailiffs.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former running mate from VV, Jaroslav Škárka.
Foreign visa-authorisation workers may undergo a "legal justification" test
As the government intends to extend the police crackdown, it is considering a "legal fact" test for foreign workers with a visa authorisation 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through the criteria to prevent the 457 being used to fulfil unqualified jobs, or as a backdoor for the relocation of family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was issued today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The loud statements of 'alias at the end of the front' and 'work first for Australians' are a very unpleasant remnant remnant of the association's demand for a protected labour market,' she told the Australian-Indic Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the white labor force was to be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if anyone in this region had heard the echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article discusses the 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is in talks with officials for human smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest is left to consider.
If the criteria for "legality" are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether "the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsor of the business."
Previous experience with businesses that have intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of them, businesses may also be required to give reasons for the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka seeking asylum has died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on the Christmas Islands as a homemaker this week.
The man's nine-year-old frightened son travelled to Australia with him and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on a boat after his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities rushed with the man to the hospital on the Christmas islands where he died.
Israeli military aircraft attacked target in Syria, said responsible
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, a responsible official for the administration confirmed to Fox News.
This responsible official did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the target of Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel carried out an air attack on missile shipments in Syria.
From the villa she moved to a block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in the apartment building with the garden and swimming pool in one of Prague's prettiest villa districts in Ořechovka.
The original owners of the house, however, recovered it in restitution and the tenants had to move away with a small severance package.
Ivana was therefore quickly looking for alternative housing for herself and her then older mother.
From acquaintances she received a tip for apartment 3 + kk in an older panelled house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to the extensive forest park and the dam excited me the other side," Ivana recalls of the first impression.
At first I thought it was going to be a makeshift for, like, three years.
"We have lived here today for more than thirteen years and I would not change not just for the gradual reconstruction," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter were then moving from a 100-dodacetre flat to a smaller apartment with an area of 62 m2 and gave out almost all the equipment.
The action was not easy, things were stored with friends, and the gradual arrangements took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary modifications had to be made, such as painting doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner crashed the core, but the owner was most bothered by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hallway, and a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to define the individual zones and subdivide the room, which allowed the new placement of the lights.
The first intervention she had committed to in a few years was the removal of the partition in the living room.
This changed the apartment to the layout to 2 + kk, but it got the room in airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to partially improving the standard was to replace the PVC floor for the laminate one.
With the bathroom, Ivana didn't know what to do.
For years, I took out home magazines and looked for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivana.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, the available hall was also adapted.
The architect joined the toilet and bathroom area and replaced two doors with the opening wings with some slides, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also wheelchair accessible.
High-quality tiles imitate sandstone, plus a comfortable seat is in the shower, a bidet shower at the toilet.
The successful collaboration with Kamila Douděrová continued on.
As part of the show How to Build a Dream, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room, which was also attended by the architect Martin Čeněk.
In the space, which was created by the combination of two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classical principles of optical division, such as half-transports or Japanese walls.
"This would, as a result, violate the openness and unity of the space," the architect explains.
It was originally possible to separate the sleeping and living areas.
All you had to do was turn two sofas with your back and put a custom-made box on the covers between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and the painting.
On the kitchen and dining area floor, the architect used a high-quality marmoleum, the sliding door she brought the sliding door to life with a pattern.
The kitchenette, if necessary, is covered by sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new anti-allergic marmolea floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate: a softer unclaid cloudless surface and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and ceilings from the plasterboard highlighted in colour is a demonstration of how to work with space in the block of flats.
I left the colours to the architects, I wished it was joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The cassettele of the graphhoskla with the motif of the flowering magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone, the architects chose a white one, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, the books were also placed in the space under the windowsillers.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.
The redesigned interior features a great contrast of the new one with the older one, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier as well as high-quality art objects that Ivana has collected all her life.
The kitchen was the last one.
The cabinets had previously been placed on either side, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect took the number of them off and rearropped the placement.
Furniture in a simple design is custom-made, the white area softens the slightly pearl-like surface.
The small space was accommodated thanks to the imaginative solution of the washing machine, the dryer and the dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen was revived by the all-glass wall cladding above the worktop.
The unique graphhosklo with the digitally printed theme is attractive, plus it is very well maintained.
Ivana chose the magnolium flowers that remind her of the popular neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here, too.
The original bathroom contained a small bath and sink, and the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cladding.
The large shower has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to make the environment a clear, simple space in which the functions and devices would be in harmony.
We unified the interior in material and colour and attempted to make its elegant, cozy, not overly crowded appearance.
"A further condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of objects of daily use," adds Kamila Douděrová.
Minister Holcát resumed the role of Main Sister for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalised so that the nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - the representative to whom they can always turn if needed," explained Martin Holcát, the Minister of Health.
I respect the work of the nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserving deserves to be given due consideration by the Ministry as well.
The pursuit of this profession requires not only a high professional professionalism, but also a human approach and personal convictions.
"I'd like to be responsible, and I will try to pursue those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us much with their approach to patients to perform their calling with all their empathy and help us improve the image of the sisters in the public eye," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Main Sister for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also said on the occasion of her inauguration that she wanted to deal with various aspects of the nurse's position and intended to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, emerging, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I fundamentally do not want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, with each having his own competencies and, together with other healthcare professionals, form a well-matched working team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, ensuring a simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some administrative tasks are unnecessarily burdensome for the nurses and take away from them the time they could and should devote to patients instead," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to co-operate in the team and with the management of health service providers, the regulation of competences, as well as employment issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or the non-exharmoing of nurses's under-emitting by their insufficient numbers in a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous complaints, but they are not documented for fear of possible recourse to a specific case where the violations could occur.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the function of the Main Sister of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee in this case of maintaining the anonymity of such a complaint and to have the specific case examined by the relevant authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Health Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study programme Nursing - Pedagogy (absolved in 1992).
Since 2010, he has been head of the nursing and other non-medical fields and the recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a bedside nurse in the internal ward, as well as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several scholarly nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, and devoted herself to lecturing in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
Guillaume Niclux has adapted Denis Diderot's novel, which brings an exceptional film quest and a rendering of the time, but is also more boring than it should have been.
It unfolds in France in the 1860s and tells the grim story of the Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to the monastery by her family.
When he rebel, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from the reprehensibly perverted mother of the forehead, and becomes the object of sexual passion for another.
The film never slides into lechery or sensationalism, and that's its problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the viewers also experiencing the aftlike wearing a horse-drawn shirt.
Jana Péťová: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big jump - a jump back a few years, to the memories, to my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash the dishes, vacuum and do your homework.
Although these "duties," it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was very different - to run up from school, throw the bag in the corner and run out.
Play ball games with the other kids, jump a dummy.
Then, on the show, Helena and her boys embroider with a chain-stitch stunt a formal tablecloth for her grandmother's birthday.
And only then, after several notifications, to finally wash the dishes, to vacuum, to fetch the wood to the tiled stove in the winter, and to do the homework after dark under the lamp (or to rely on a classmate and instead of the tasks to write in love with the school's love).
In the morning, to have homemade strawberry marmalade (from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, the contents of which were not even lying next to the strawberries) and to drink it with a chicle of dried herbs, which my mother and I were so fond of collecting.
I also remember the magic evenings, when the deathly silence in the nursery was when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on cassettes that were loudly filmed in an old tape recorder by my mom.
And then on the pencil, we rewire the cassettes and played one of the same songs over and over again, our favorite, and toasted with a sip of the siphon.
Or we phoned across the table using cans that were tied to each other with string - and while we're on the phone call to be better heard, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, the ear-ears then-chain was a match + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live on it so that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
The dress was inherited from generation to generation, and the best "brew" into the wardrobe was a batik home-made T-shirt with SAVA.
From the electronics, the aforementioned mom's cassette-caucus was enough to be happy, and at most, the Walkman we shared with our sister, which, by the way, we used only on the train on the school trip anyway.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Kloboučka Hop or Man, Don't Be Mad, or as I've already said, to go "just out."
When I was a bit older, we got a video player under the tree, surely my parents saved for it for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't warm up for a long time.
My younger sister stuffed a strudel in him, said he was so beautiful to eat the tapes, so she tried to see if she could sleep a strudel.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, this episode is still on his dad's plate, poor, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she stuffed the strudel in the video and thought she would play it with a recipe and not outplayed it, which is why he still can't bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate with each other, to talk without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I, on vacation with my grandmother's granddaughter, we set up with our neighbors' granddaughter, when we'd meet again next summer at my grandmother's' house - and that's the way it was.
We're gathered.
Promise yourself with someone now that you'll see each other in a year's time?!
I also remember the winter when we ran outdoors with the whole village, built snowmen, rode the snowmeter in the church on sacks stuffed with h h h h hoks.
Then the whole family and I dined together and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I would hear before each dinner the notorious phrase: "Being to wash your hands!"
Yes, that is true today, but I'm sure you don't have the tap-carized soap in the lemons net.
After dinner, when my dad "worked" in the garage for a beer with Jarda from the village, we lay down on the floor with my mom and I, resting our legs on the tiled stove, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackle of the wood that had been made of the linoch.
We were closer - really - not counting how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't write messages daily through various cottages, SMS messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew a lot more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at albums where they are neatly glued with black horns-induced black-and-white photos.
And in case I didn't know how old I was then, the back of the photo is always written a year of taking a picture.
I am looking to see that although the pot-cutters didn't suit us very well and, moreover, we had a pair of pants after a cousin's, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better get back that step forward - to reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting to see what the modern age will come up with for, say, one day for my children.
What I do know for sure is that these memories of mine are now, for the younger adolescent generation, at least somewhere "in the old-timers" and I think they're missing a lot that they won't experience this "pre-monkey" time either.
I wish they did!
They must save, young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea with what interest
More and more Czechs are putting their money aside.
Still, they do not reach the region's savings champions.
The most money is being deposited aside by the Austrians, who save an average of €181 a month.
A little more than Czechs, people in Slovakia are also saving.
This is according to a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer group in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers is improving, and two-thirds of respondents plan to set aside more money.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little of saving products.
For example, almost one in two Serbies saves at home "under the pillow" at home, according to the survey.
Domestically, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has risen this year.
As recently as last year, 26 percent of respondents put off 1,000 to 2.5 thousand crowns each month for various types of savings, up five percent more this year.
However, the average monthly storage in the year-on-year comparison fell slightly to CZK 2078.
The biggest hit among savings products is the supplementary pension insurance.
This is favoured by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to value savings for only 36 percent of people.
Conversely, the popularity of building savings is declining, with interest in investment funds also falling significantly compared to last year.
Only 16 percent of respondents already use these, compared to almost a quarter of people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns they make on individual products.
Young people under 30 in particular do not know how their money is remunerated.
Conversely, the earliest awareness of the profitability of their deposited money is the oldest group, with 73 per cent of respondents aware of the return on the return list of the money, among people over the age of 50.
In an international comparison of the Erste group, Czechs lead online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Austrians with 12 percent distance.
Australian woman appeals to stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to a 15-day prison in Phuket Island when she falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally 15. June accused by the provincial court on the island of Phuket of the perjury of a perjury when she told the Thai police that the driver of the taxi, along with two other men who were holding her, attacked her in the early hours of Sunday 10. June.
However, a recording from an industrial television television later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after she had separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Police from the island of Phuket interviewed Bamford for two days before confessing to making up the story.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detachment facility on the Phuket periphery instead of being placed in adult women's prisons.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney-based Sunday Telegraph that the entire family had "extreme concerns" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It's a challenging time, in isolation, but we hope to be safely back to us as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the ruling and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia say she has spent her holidays in the Krabi recreation area in the south of Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but is said to have been warned that the appeal may lead to court proceedings that will increase her sentence and result in placement in adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to correct the bruised picture for tourists, which may have been behind the acquittal verdict.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
The lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Cologne Municipal Social House not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the show Among Us singers Lenka Nova, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Matěj Benko.
After the opening intra and acting etude a delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, came alone with a candle in his hand, recalling the story of how they last played in Cologne and the theatre and the electric current fell out throughout the city.
"Otherwise in Cologne, they made two types of cards that I came in contact with a lot of," he recalled.
He also recalled the native of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of the Zákolany or Dúbravka u Bratislava," he quipped about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horacek, who had not left the stage and, if he had not spoken, sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical feat.
The calendar was also done by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, but about ice hockey he had no idea at the time, how we meet in those squares and chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech Calendar, but we won't play it here for you here today," he amused.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this record for him a very suitable Sleep in the day, sing at night and accompanied himself to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by the band in the composition of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
The three vocalists together sang a bit of a ripper Into the Slope of the Heat, a seat that immediately spurted the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Horáček responded afterwards.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, I heard I'm hearing in the performance of František Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with huge applause, Hana Heger was reminded of the song Dad liked by Lída Baarová as well as with Horáček's explanation of the communist ban and replacement of Baar by the American actress Mae West.
Composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the song Sebastián, Segrado then sang the gorgeous song Prague set to music by Jarda Svoboda, a native and a former Kolíňák.
But that was the conclusion, the applause standing and the encore in the form of an optimistic piece We Live in a wonderful time.
There was another encore for the playlist, but the fans didn't kick out.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four sat at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the cover from the legendary LP and she took a photo with prospective buyers.
Recently, the CEO of CEZ announced that he was postponing the decision to build the 3rd and 4th units of the Temelín power plant until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Policy and by agreeing the Government's Contracts of the difference of the difference.
With these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should make recommendations to the shareholder, not hide behind it.
Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over parental leave program
Billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest because of a parental leave programme because his daughters can become pregnant and benefit.
The Mining Magnate, who is in dispute over the $6 million coal tax credit for the payment of a $6 million coal tax, made the claim when he tried to sweep the question of whether there was a conflict of interest on the table.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate that play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be in a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit the policy of the personal benefit.
"He's been in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters were to become pregnant, he would be directly interested in whether she would get parental leave," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the race for the Fairfax precinct in the Sunshine Coast area after recourse to the election.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polls have closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately, and get the results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to label as ballots.
Is it the case that the results can be erased if someone doesn't like it?
These days and at this time, the use of pennies seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission studied electronic voting opportunities and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his policy agenda also applied to the airports in the Sunshine Coast area and that he would take his new job "very seriously."
The Public Office is a public service.
"We are not seeking any remuneration except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
The new Civil Code is being prepared for six companies out of ten
The impending effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act as of 1 January 2014 has been intensively prepared by six firms out of ten.
Only eight percent of the company representatives surveyed said they had not addressed the issues related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This is according to a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the views of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the upcoming effective date for the two key codes, it is only now at the last minute that a number of managers are beginning to realise the significant effect on their companies' business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the lavishing of politicians, the business sector has long been in the dark about whether revolutionary changes will eventually take place or not.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left to make the transition to the new right for their companies without any complications," said the partner of Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively involved in the new codes, 26 percent said their firms had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
Furthermore, 35 per cent of companies of this number are about to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, one in five companies has not yet dealt with recoding, yet it has a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and are unable to assess the issue.
Only eight per cent of companies admit that the issues associated with the recodes have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the contracting of new contracts (21 per cent) for the largest number of companies surveyed, followed by a solution to the terms of trade (16 per cent) and changes in the Land Register and in liability for damages (after 10 percent).
Contracts will take place one of the most important novelties of the entire recodification, namely the unification of contract modifications only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in both the Civil and Commercialodes will cease to be extinguished, with the result that the contract law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs alike.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many innovations with an emphasis on greater freedom of arrangement of relationships," said Lukas Poddaný, attorney at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In the context of the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of the statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
This is followed by topics on changes to the convening and conduct of the general meeting (15 per cent) and representing the company (14 per cent).
The new legislation means tightening up the obligations and possible impacts for the statutory bodies, especially in a situation where a company is at risk of bankruptcy or reaches it.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the boards of directors and the managers of the companies do not act with the care of a proper treasurer and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit of the acquired for the performance of the post for the last two years," Spáčil said.
NSA revelations increase social paranoia of state surveillance
On a peaceful day towards the end of August, a German police helicopter was buzzing at the US consulate office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the instruction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic news agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the US forward-sided patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media claim that the BfV Office hoped to be able to identify the presence of listening antennae, and the event triggered an exchange of views in Berlin between the US and German foreign ministers.
In September, James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence options "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profit."
But since Edward Snowden, who became an associate as an informant, began to uncover his valuable collection from secret surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading businessmen no longer know if to believe the director's words.
After reports that the US National Security Agency was espionage in a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data available to US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, general paranoia about state-protection reached new dimensions.
The last drop came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was perhaps bugged for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the potential targets are certainly also the leading entrepreneuus.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence services and companies more transparent.
I would say that it is possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey issued in July by the EY consultancy service, German companies believe that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much risk as China.
However, the entire dossier revealed by Mr Snowden is not yet in evidence that the United States was handing over the trade secrets of foreign firms to its own companies.
Policymakers have expressed concerns that the EU lacks some IT and internet capabilities and said it should seek to reduce its US dependence:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German Parliament that we should make the German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly again...
That's not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the American spy agencies uncovered by Snowden is still shocking to some companies who have thought that China is the biggest threat of surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have become more aware, more widely, that the data stored in the US is under the jurisdiction there and are therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance business community, around 10 percent of non-American members canceled data-rolling programs after US Prism's disclosure program to use a cloud provider based in the US.
Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs of SAP, says, "Do we have a new customer issue that wasn't here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction?"
Many German senior officials argue that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: that the powerful states want to alienate their most precious secrets, and this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
"This has been a major issue for many years and this has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the agrochemical company BASF.
The Americans are doing espionage on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we do espionage on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally don't want to boast much about the countermeasures they've made to potentially give the attacker no advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free memory USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi's board of directors, says it has been a common practice to collect mobile phones before a board meeting to prevent them from being used as a listening device.
The German BfV office advises executives to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be misappropriated.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
"Many and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised approach," warns the BfV in its report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington, in February, US National Intelligence Estimate documents listed France, alongside Russia and Israel, in the second rows of perpetrators involved in the hacking activity for economic correspondents, in addition to Russia and Israel, right behind China.
A member of the council in a German risk-free society concluded that, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France's internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: "Services know quite well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are conducting espionage on their allies."
New nicotine vaccine may take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of vaccine could protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
There are other tests before human exams that take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have exhausted all the methods available to the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong to overcome all current approaches," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-inicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies chase all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, preventing the smoker from taking a nicotine hit.
In the tests of the vaccinated mice, which were additionally supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But the mice that weren't vaccinated, "sanched," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had gotten into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injection had to be administered often enough to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody-making factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, children could be given to them before they want to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't have any enjoyment of it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that'll help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but point out that further research is needed.
The desperate cry of Obama's voter
I voted for Obama twice – I shared hope for a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts were derailed by the Republican Party's obstruction
Obstruction policy cannot excuse the woes of Obama's healthcare website or unmanned aircraft attacks
The Memores of the Obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a year of medics at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
About this book, I thought that during the bleak days of my second year of my sophomore year at the medical school, I would be encouraged and renewed for me in me.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and these are memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish the patient reviews in the evening and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when the policy inspired millions of people and the speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelmingly dominance, and the TV coverage made us reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents kept the newspapers they could get.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent of support.
And this is where I'm closing the book.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is hard to recall these optimistic days - seeming to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I threw in my first ballot, there were indeed changes.
It was certainly none of the things I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse successes – from the Affordable Care Act to the removal of our troops from Iraq, and the end of the "no question, say nothing" policy after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the party's filibuster has reversed so much of an effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is an immigration reform, the public's ability to choose health care and close the base in Guantánamo.
But after many situations in which I have defended the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and comrades, I have reached an absolute limit when it comes to the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political hopelessness.
Republicans' obstruction cannot explain the approval of the wiretapping of foreign leaders or the drone raids that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by them that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the private lives of Americans, or that it is persecuting those who uncover the government's wrong actions.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a proper trial, or for limiting public contributions and expenses during the presidential campaigns.
It is impossible to justify the discovery of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, they can't excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after the signing of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if such a thing was to be expected.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government power could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The election position is clearly not in a predictable course, and our public talks will be shaped by the opposition political party and random events like the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to the extent to be the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unpublished alternative, and he seemed unable to consolidate his policies or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we had once heard of.
Still, a return to 2008 – with Obama's support to fall below 45% this week – is getting harder through this book.
It makes me remember the series of promises that have faded.
This week, I read in the book a chapter on how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At the next meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back up to speed and remain loyal to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I agree with you.

ŠkoFIN's business and marketing is run by Abraham
Its competencies include the product and marketing area and the strengthening of cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Ludek Šantor.
Abrahamk has linked the last 14 years of his professional career with the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, subsequently at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the brand and dealers Alfa Romeo for seven years.
His last job was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was created in 1992.
Syria has destroyed its means for the production of chemical weapons, says supervisory authority
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition, the Global Chemicals Assignment Board said on Thursday, while violent conflicts erupted in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where poisonous substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group said that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
Announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
a term set by this organization based in The Hague for the destruction or to prevent the operation of all chemical weapons and machinery for the mixing of chemicals for the creation of poisonous gas and filling of munitions.
Completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
But Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
This country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as the fighting raged in the town of Safira on Thursday, which experts refer to as the headquarters of both the chemical weapons and repositories factory, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, said, based in Britain.
A group of activists, which monitored the total number of casualties through a network of activists in Syria, reported on Thursday that 120 296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of the armed forces of Bashar al-Assad, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Among those killed are also expected to be 2,22,20 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25. On July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira, many of whom are associated with Al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The observator atll said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific figures.
The fighting underscored the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in their mission to get rid of the chemical arsenal of Syria in the middle of the ongoing civil war, have to deal with the narrow deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which is working closely with the UN, it was said that his team was now "satisfied that it has verified - and watched the destruction - of Syria's declared crucial equipment for production and mixing/concerning."
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit two locations because of security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that the two sites had been "released and ... the items in the chemical weapons programme it contained have been moved to two other declared sites that have been checked," according to Syria.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I bow to the courage and bravery that you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission that this organization has ever had," observers' director Ahmet Uzumcu said in his commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government, with its security forces, are facing each other in the civil war, which are full of members of the Alawit sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the Observer, Rami Abdul Rahman, said there was a powerful explosion on Wednesday inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lázikiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
"We are witnessing a milestone today: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in his statement.
This project is a key element of the European continent's energy security.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the Russian export routes through Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, say officials.
Miller says that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "always" removed.
As soon as the entire project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says the construction is expected to begin in other countries in the direction of the flow at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Early puberty: Advanced Previously
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanics reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is coming
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind it
Experts say one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an obesity epidemic.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in the boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in the health of children and family problems.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start to grow at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Physicians this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, explained that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent much of my time assuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic hair on ohanz and under the armpits and body odor, appear in girls earlier.
Over the last forty years, however, there has been only a small shift at an age where the first menstruation takes place.
It is now an average age of 12.5 years in the United States, compared to the age of 12.75, in 1970.
"When breast boobs start to develop, it will be at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (Time Brief Bum on Girls: An Injury Guide to Matching This Frequent Problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is the time.
Discussions are discussed for what activates the actual start of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered to be "prematurely mature."
In most cases, the process is slowed down or stopped – which can be closely monitored by pedigree doctors.
Faster growth may be a reason for the endocrinologist to carry out tests to avoid serious problems such as a tumor or a cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to a halt to growth and stunduct in adulthood.
Recommendations on medication and hormone treatment are dependent on the child's age, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
When it comes to the use of medicines, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that "suppressing puberty can alleviate the woman's behavioral problems and her feelings that she differs from her peers."
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have their period.
"They're worried he can get pregnant or manage the sanitation," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started to be menstrual at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends's.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, environment chemicals or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys – like girls - reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped carry out a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9, who combines body fat with the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations vary.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are already at a young age in the pubic hair in the face and on the bud, the trend towards the full flowering of early puberty is not as clear as the girls do.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Children's Physician Association (AAP) added additional complexities to the subject.
Acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endhancer at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from their paediatric doctor on how to speak to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the child sooner than you'd like to assume," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who develop earlier need to be reassured that even if it does so prematurely, the process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
They face a decisive battle.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamún.
According to the still-reliant reports, Israel destroyed rockets for Hezbollah in two locations in two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of its army.
Its agenda is also to fight Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of weaponry to Hezbollah's hands to Lebanon.
News of the Israeli arms depots in Western Syria on Wednesday is yet to be clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but was confirmed by U.S. sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news station claims that two warehouses in which the missiles were prepared to be transported to Lebanon were hit.
According to its sources, they were Russian-made missiles of the SA-8 production.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said that Syria is continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles, and the Syrian air force is teaching members of the Hezbollah armed section to handle missiles.
The SA-8 are outdated missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are mounted on the moving chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, it is easy to hide thanks to its mobility and small size.
They are equipped with radar, which is switched off after the missile is fired, making it difficult to lock on.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alaves.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He says he helps protect the Syrian Shiite community, to which the Alaskans belong.
Now, reportedly, the 15,000 of his fighters are ready to help conquer the army back to Kalamún.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalamún lies between Damascusk and the country's third largest city, Homs.
The battle, according to al-Arabi's source, is in retaliation for the opposition's recent attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Shiite Brigade, Abu Fadla Abbas, in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to win back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the rebels from Kusajr went to Kalamún.
In it, he argues that Maliki has played a large part in the reconstruction of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly the work of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
For the ČSSD, Sobotka negotiates.
Social democracy is crumbling, the people and the grandmothers speak to each other and are preparing a joint approach.
If the Social Democrats get better in a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly well-played partners who put a ready list of demands, including ministerial posts, on the table.
The ČSSD envoys will then either swallow the sour coalition grapes or give a nod to the fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka first came across after four days of being on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to take over the political body and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party so far is only him, the other team members will only be allowed after a key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the board and now to the citizens.
You're not supposed to lie, in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hašek, said after the meeting of the Social Democrat's inner leadership.
He added that he did not cling to the post of first vice-president.
"I will communicate my decision on 10 November at the CPSU," said Hasek.
The deputy chairman of the ČSSD, Zdeněk Škromach, and the head of the deputy club, Jeroným Tejc, spoke similarly.
He pointed out, however, that he had been elected just two days ago.
The two MPs then said they would do their best to make the 50-member ČSSD club sounding with one voice.
The embrial theatre was given the crown by Michal Hašek: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities."
So another lie on live television.
Or did he forget, in his call to Sobotka's resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team, that the ACT in August, with 57 percent, had agreed that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party's candidate for prime minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, by convening the ÚVVV, made a powerful army of enemies until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of the 1921 members of this institution and the media with a collection of various gossip and rumors, or to recall the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
There will be powerfully laundry to wash, and there will be hints of a dark alliance between the coal baron Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
A friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential attorney Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
They will be debated in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the ČSSD.
The cheering are the words of the mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka's ally, Petr Kajnar: "I signed the Charta 77 so that the country should not be ruled by idiots."
If the CISA had met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritual sacrifice of their functions.
Traitors sprinkle their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently victorious ČSSD chief will then quit with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
UN celebrates new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work promptly on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which would be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
Speaking at the summit overnight, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said it was now time to "get over national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to establish the general Sustainable Development Goals - the SDGs," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the MDGs.
Babiš: The government with only Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political trade in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one at all.
The ANO president admitted this in an interview with Právo, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin promised environmental Olympics, plan hatched by giant secret landfills
Winter sports fans are already cutting a meter by the start of the Sochi Olympics, while others are looking at their preparation with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, though not starting until February, is facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be failing to deliver on the promise that the preparation and hosting of the Games will not in the slightest disturb nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After all, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high bar, with the Canadian Games in the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
But it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to hold "zero waste" games long ago.
AP reporters last week discovered a giant landfill of building materials in the village of Achshtyr, near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulation foams was found in August by environmentalists, which they immediately reported.
Russian authorities have been kal fork and the landfill has disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters got a glimpse of a landfill the size of three football pitches.
It is not the only one to create several in the area of such places, the British newspaper The Times described.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly that is building a roughly 60-kilometre route between Sochi Airport and a sports resort, is working on the site.
The business, which has already consumed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways resisted that the landfill had been set up by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achštyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
According to experts, the waste is at risk of contaminating the local Mzymmt River, other streams, and finally the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates the Soc water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimyev of the environmental nonprofit organization EWNC told the British newspaper.
The illegal landfills are not the only problem with the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
By way of comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics came to $43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and worries about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there were also reports that human rights were not respected at the sports and infrastructure exhibitions.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth shut in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers will grapple with a new law during the Games that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gay men at the Olympics.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on the aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airline passengers will have to continue to switch off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landings, even disregarding the changes in the US to relax the regulations on these facilities.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies the leeway to change their procedures, allowing passengers to read e-books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in the "airlift" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but it annoys many people that they cannot have access to their e-books during take-off and landings.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined this announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on the aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they obtain from the crew.
Virgin, which had already spoken to CASA about the extension of the use of its on-board entertainment wi-fi system, was in favor of the change but announced that it would undergo a regulatory decision.
"We would welcome CASA to analyse the permission to use electronic devices because we really think that it would improve the customer experience now that we have (wireless on-board fun)," the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will stick to the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon," he said.
The FAA's regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
But we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful to our travellers, and we will certainly study the FAA's decisions and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will be different from the company to the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio jamming of mobile phones, as well as revising manuals, training material, hand luggage programmes and passenger information.
"Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and light electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to disable the device during the landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier devices be safely stored under the seats or in the overhead storage area during take-off and descent.
Nonsense in Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the universe of Gravity sold out in the Czech Republic for some time after its premiere.
It was seen by nearly 150,000 viewers in October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, earning over CZK 26 million.
Most reviews rate the picture positively.
Others, however, find certain inconsistencies.
Lidovky.cz asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Observatory and Planetarium Brno): I like science fantamy films that I consider modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity included, although it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean he's wrong.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice the hair of Sandra Bullock, which somehow does not come in weightlessness.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station move on significantly different orbiting, so they cannot be seen in one frame.
Some viewers blame the film for the unrealistically acting effect and the whole behaviour of the fire in weightlessness.
The suits, they said, would also not withstand such wounds.
Heroes in Gravity often collide with various objects, and suits can withstand everything without too much difficulty.
Criticism was not spared the plot of the plot.
Such a large-scale tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, according to some debaters.
In addition, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to correct the technique.
People argue on the forums about the "unreal" behaviour of the ropes.
It is said to be as if it were intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Observatory and Planetarium of the City. Prague): I have only seen it on a wide screen so far, but I can clearly say, I have been enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, it was science fiction.
And for such a story, the author has the right (almost to the obligation) not to be consistently observed with reality.
"More than the discrepancy you mentioned, I was touched by the number of times as the space station with the degrading level of technology (most recently Chinese) is shown."
"Chinese, after all, will be in the end of the decade and will probably look better than it is in the film."
Vladimír Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In the computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in not breaking the laws of physics, and so the naturalized viewer will appreciate that the moment of moment of momentum, in the vocabulary of physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is very realistic, including the thin skin of the atmosphere and the aurorag flickering on the polar regions.
Irregularities will surely be found in a more detailed examination.
Additionally, for example, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various cosmic trash in orbit appears in reverse in some scenes than should actually be the case (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things were adapted by the creators to their needs, but I did not record any fundamental and blatant transgression against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus, you can see that the creators took care of the credibility of the events depicted.
From moments that make no sense to name the fact that the Hubble Space Teofel is orbiting in an otherwise downtrodden orbit than the ISS.
The consequence is a significantly different mutual speed and the rescue operation could not actually take place as it was shown in the film.
Then, at the moment of the Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) department, I didn't notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces the two players to let go at the moment they are no longer moving towards each other.
Bombardier's profit plummeted as a result of a drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, which is due to fewer orders and aircraft deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release any air test data for its new aircraft of the type CSeries, nor did it offer up-to-date information on whether the aircraft would adhere to an ambitious plan to launch a commercial operation from next September.
After the launch test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not meet estimates, and shares on the Toronto stock market fell by 8 percent.
State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded his rating on Thursday from a "higher return" to "profit-seeking" to the sector, with the expectation that the stock market would experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While we mostly expected smaller shipments of aircraft, the profit margin in the field of transport has been significantly disappointed by us," Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the trial program continues, we believe that Bombardier will get new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market's scepticism to the programme to increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will fight their way into the bottom of the market area, which are now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was detected in March and the first flight was held in September after a delay of several months.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177 as potential buyers are waiting for the results of a test flight to verify the company's low-consumption claims and savings on the cost of this airliner.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and liabilities from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to achieve its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was launched for commercial use.
Leaders also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that the ground-based rehearsal and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did that.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the others not long after.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the first customer starting to run the CSeries for 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims to have evaluated its plan for commissioning the aircraft and providing updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight tests – even though it is in line with Bombardier's internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
From USD 172 million or 9 cents per share the previous year in the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier' net profit fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share.
Adjusted returns per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
The turnover has fallen marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Under Thomson Reuters' IBES system, analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it supplied only 45 aircraft to the quarter, compared to 57 aircraft the year before.
Net orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aerial division accounted for 32.9 billion as of 30 September, which is unchanged on 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our prospects, but the low order reception and the overall state of the market disappointed us," Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said the return in the division rose by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts accounted for 32.6 billion as of September 30, a marginal increase of 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by the problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Leaders said new outlooks would be provided in the fourth quarter.

Mick Jagger says he definitely didn't leave after the then 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview with the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that she sang the backing vocals for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" for Jagger's song.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he came out on it.
She added, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very kind to me."
In a Thursday statement, Jagger's (70) said the representative categorically denied that he had ever made Katy Perry's proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers (sepings) who appeared on the Rolling Stones' concert tour this year.
Her new album, "Prism," debuted in the first place this week.
Kenya's press outraged by the controversial media law
"This is frightening news, and it is fair to ask what will prevent parliament from simply sweating the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper said, deeming the bill to be unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be prejudiced because it is the government's extension hand" and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to the Star daily, the bill effectively hands over to the government "full control of the media" and the Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "hit a harsh blow" and criticize the bill as "strict."
The approval of the bill comes in the midst of a series of measures to strengthen national security immediately following the Islamic shooter's attack at the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The authorities' anger was approached by the Kenyan media when it broadcasts a security camera footage of the soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looted a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by summoning two journalists and a head of a media officer for questioning, but the summons were later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million by Kenyan shillings and individual journalists can be fined up to one million, along with the risk of "depacted from the list" or be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The General Court also has the right to seize the assets of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "there is also one fine enough to dispose of most of the radio stations."
It is also reported that these measures may have a winding-up impact on what is called Kenyan's "living blogosphere."
Politicians know that if they shut up the media, they can do what they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen," the journalist for the Nation Mutuma Mathiu wrote, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of the system of mutual control and balancing in public life.
"Leaving it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and cast us back for hunting and harvesting," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been criticized by the public in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of abolishing the cuts imposed by the National Wage Agency and the resumption of their hefty salaries of around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, making it the highest in the world.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble is bursting
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the proceeds of the financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborn, who presented a 7% transfer fee in the 2012 budget for buildings at a price of over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who own properties within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds from the transfer fee for the transfer of real estate in the housing stock in the districts of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached £708 million in the tax year 2012/13, exceeds the total total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: ‘Given the increase in the transfer of real estate at the home of high value and the presentation of the related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are little taxed, regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system."
He added that "this move may have caused some foreign investors to make properties in London reluctant to buy, or that the existing owners are reluctant to sell."
Front properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in a rich strip ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, they saw an increase of a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in the centre of London continue to show steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but were overshadowed by the booming "domestic market" at which the real estate agencies Savills surveyed the southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the increase.
Arctic Monkeys postponed Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys moved up the concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with larygreze inflammation.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
But the disease of lead singer Alexa Turner forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys group says: "After the decision to postpone today's appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham, and on the basis of medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the appearance at the Hydro in Glasgow complex scheduled for Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngeal inflammation and, unfortunately, he will not be able to disperse."
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will thus take place on 20 November and a performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
