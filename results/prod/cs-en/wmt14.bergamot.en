Economia and the Centre connect management.
They will offer, for example, a joint advertisement
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Karlín, Prague.
Economia took another step to transform the Centre holding into its media house.
As of Friday, both Economia and the Center have joint top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house," comments the aforementioned changes to the Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economie and the commissioned CEO, Kamil Čermák.
Čermák, who will head the unified management, will be joined by the Executive Director of the Centre Holdings, Andreas Demuth.
The new joint director of the business was appointed Pavel Vopařil, to whom the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tylčerová, is also subordinated to.
The new head of information technology was Stephen Burda.
The joint director of the editorial staff is Vladimír Piskáček, whose team includes the director for transformation, Jakub Unger.
The newly established role of marketing director was commissioned by Adéla Pitts.
A separate corporate communication unit is now managed by Věra Lhotská.
The joint finance director is Karel Žalud, the management of human resources for both publishers is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will, among other things, enable us to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better link the production of content of all published titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the company's business management," Čermák added.
Economia, which is owned by the financier Zdeněk Bakala, entered into a contract to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of this year.
The Centrum Holdings portfolio consists of the servers Aktuálně.cz, Žena.cz, the web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto, or a portfolio of other nearly two dozen smaller websites.
Economia is the publisher of Hospodářské noviny, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly Respekt and the Economist weekly and the number of printed and internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to the newly built modern premises in Karlín, Prague.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was to be Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military aircraft reportedly bombed a military base close to the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
Citing an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported the news.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the attack was not confirmed by the Israeli government.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli military, asked by CNN, declined to comment on the information about the raid.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
The target of the Israeli raid, according to a US government source, was a missile and related equipment that the Israelis thought could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, reported that the target of an Israeli raid on a target on Syrian territory was Russian missiles SA-1125.
A second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was the allegedly highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area, however, showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles, according to DPA.
In addition, they said they showed a battery of missiles SA-3, including a radar-seat radar to track missiles and their targets.
The recorded missiles have a range of 35 kilometers to reach the size of 35 kilometres and could carry warheads weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP reported.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly claimed to have affected any shipment of weapons destined for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that a return was unlikely.
In a late-night interview to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he resigned after ten years in a leadership position, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks about British politics, confining his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy of the Beezac's Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his reply from the London-based Evening Standard quoted as follows: "Yes, of course, but that is hardly likely to happen, so..."
Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport for shooting
Shots were fired at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport because of this, allegedly the terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, claims that the men of the law shot with a rifle of an armed man.
The Los Angeles Times, referring to police, said there was a shootout that injured two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration.
How many people were injured in total and whether there are any victims but it is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more injuries.
Berdych and Stepanek will be joined by Rosol and Hájek
For the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players, Jaroslav Navil, nominated the four-player Tomáš Berdych, Radek Stepanek, Lukáš Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech national team defends the trophy but are going to play on the pitch of their opponents to the Belgrade Arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in the last five years.
"We know we're going to the hot ground, that it's going to be wild and we have to focus on our performances as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said Stepanek, the architect of the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Brno observatory takes visitors to space in the new digitarium
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can dig into the new comfortable seats and above their heads a projection area with a diameter of 17 metres in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To be perfect, the painting is scattered in the hall by other smaller projectors.
Another important part of the entire facility is hidden behind the hall walls.
"This is twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Brno observatory, Jiří Dušek.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a complete impression.
"Computer performance is 30 to 40 times higher than for classic personal computers," said Tomáš Hladík, a technician at the observatory.
The digitalarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body, or the bottom of the ocean.
Viewers find themselves right in the middle of the universe or the brain of a person.
Another similar facility is closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to screen purchased shows and their own productions in the hall.
There have been two shows on the agenda since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is for adults.
In it, people learn about the astronaut training, go into space, turn into centrifuge, and then see, on graphic examples, the challenging conditions the astronauts in space face.
The second show is for children and is called the Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colourful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the eruption of a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitarium cost roughly fifty million crowns, which was paid for mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory from its budget also contributed smaller amounts.
The design area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed by audiovisual technology and computers," Dušek explained.
The installation of the digitarium followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory passed through two years ago.
According to director Dušek, there could still be 25,000 to 30,000 visitors by the end of the year.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's Health Care Act
The Supreme Court in the US ruled that the Health Care Act signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
With a vote of 5:4, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection Act and affordable care - which requires citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014, or face a fine, against the Constitution under the authority of government's tax authority.
The president of the court, John Roberts, sided with the four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the rest of the Act on 2700 pages and further ruled that the statutory health care requirement that mandates states to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise the loss of all funding for social security insurance from federal sources, is not law enforcement and contrary to the Constitution.
The action to block that law was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
During the 2012 primary, the law was strongly rejected by each of the leading Republican candidates, including the presumed proposed nominee Mitt Romney.
Nadia Konvalinko in the role of pub.
Does she have a new job?
Actress Nadia Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the saloon in the role of a pub and was very good at it.
Had the popular Czech actress planned to change the profession and embark on a business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinki appeared in James Joyce's Irish pub and was shooting beer.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I was good at it.
The boss even offered to hire me and I could make a living by spinning beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stick with what I do to this day, with acting," revealed Konvalinková, who was a guest on the twentieth anniversary of the Irish pub's operation, with a smile.
"I like Irish beer and I'll have Irish whiskey from time to time," the actress said.
Nadi's long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nový also appeared at the event.
I am dead and must not drink in my new life today.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I try to keep that up," the actor added.
Egypt launches first freely elected president
Muhammad Morsi took the inauguration, but his triumphant day will be hard-pressed to end in the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMISTA Muhammad Morsi promised "new Egypt" when he was inaugurated as the country's first freely elected president, after Hosni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his commission before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges clad in black roasts in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony a live broadcast on state television.
"The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy, and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer graduated in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most of the 84 years since its creation as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived in a small motorcade of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time, the building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police.
Only a few hundred supporters met in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and, unlike the presidential ostentation of Mubarak's period, traffic was only briefly halted so that the motorcade could pass through the usually busy road connecting the city center to the suburbs in the south.
The personal prestige of Morsi, derisively referred to as the non-charismatic "residential tire" of the Muslim Brotherhood, has soared since his victory and his speech on Friday, which was aimed at presenting him not only as an Islamist candidate, but also of all those who want to bring to the end of the rebellion against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional, and modern state," Morsi, clad in a blue, formal dress with a red tie to the judges in the wood-picked chamber where he was sworn in.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to present an inaugural address.
As he stood at attention, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
Present was the military commander of field marshal Hussein Tanthai.
His arrival was accompanied by the chants of the "army and the people are one hand" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s it became a stronghold of the Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square on Friday, the place where the revolution that ended Mubarak's authoritarian government was born, and solemnly promised to seize the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council, which took them over from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath in court rather than in front of the parliament, as is customary, he acquiesced to the will of the military, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Anyone who really wants to get to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the manners' centre with the sights, churches and galleries, more than the bedeker would reveal.
Many people "read from the graves."
They roam the cemeteries slowly and gain intimate insight into the local reality.
They are investigating what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what beliefs they are, how big and cohesive families they belong, at what age they die here, how important their degrees and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, their taste.
And from the state of the graves, they will find out how the survivors heeded about their dead.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up late and show off to the neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a cheapskate.
For two years, there hasn't been a candy in my apartment, and this year is probably no different.
However, the statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween, the black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), this year's most Americans - in fact 158 million of them - will celebrate Halloween this year, and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes, and ornaments.
But what I look forward to every time on Halloween is the trends.
According to the NRF, $6.9 billion spent is expected to go to $1.2 billion for costumes.
This year, the latest fad in fashion is the sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy doesn't have to be just women anymore; it can also be sexy foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots.
As for the men, I expect the parade of the dead to see a lot of zombies, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will make it to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with going according to tradition.
Last year we put our dogs in costumes and, to my astonishment, we weren't the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, the Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for pets.
So he'll see a lot of funny doggies.
As for sweets, we don't waste time.
According to Nielsen, the Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's roughly 300 million kg of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is an amazing report for the 41 million trick-or-treaters who, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, are about to raid our neighborhoods.
In fact, during Halloween we buy, and believe it or not believe in, consume, 45 million kg of chocolate.
The only thing we don't want is corn candy, and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners, nearly 16,000 tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candy.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" "The Horror behind the Walls, which, by the way, is a real prison) "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are officially insiders in the United States of 1,200 haunted homes that, according to the company American haunted houses, have a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing pictures that you're watching the fears that your friend puts on Facebook, and you can't remove them, and the person you like, looks at the photo and comments as "you look nice."
Finally, a little about pumpkins.
Ever since we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the big pumpkin (Great Pumpkin), and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree - we've done it since we were a little kid.
Luckily, the "child in pumpkin" trend started with the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up to carving the gourd instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the US Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with the shimmering flame on your front porch is probably from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins grew this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from the city of Napa, California, and try to cut up their pumpkin weighing almost one ton.
How the Insects from Thailand picked up the sales of the Paris bar
You may be scraping yourself over the insects, and yet you have no idea that you eat it quite voluntarily every year.
For example, grounded in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you have a unique experience taken care of as well.
The insect offer was the first to be included in Paris on the menu of his establishment at the beginning of October by Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, which was inspired by William Burroughs' book Naked Lunch, would be found in the fashionable 18th arrondus near Montmartre by well-visited by tourists.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail egg, guests can now only bite the sketches of various larvae, locusts or water beetles, and scorpions can be tasted here.
Carefully and specially packed vans (so as to avoid harming insects, do not damage the wings, or damage their eyes) are sent to Daviron all the way from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it's common elsewhere.
The owner of a Paris bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons to consume insects.
The first is an ecological benefit, because insect production is much less costly for our planet (what is about finance, space, and water consumption) than with traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef will not deny his profession, simply aiming to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just conveying a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be excited about the idea of consuming a bug decorated with pesto, but the reaction of the Paris bar's customers to the restaurants served in the insects are, according to the owner, very positive.
Even the skeptics are said to eventually taste it, even if they begin with the smallest souwels, and only finally pick a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting saucers range from five to nine euros.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing hands to you CHANGE I NEW.
The experiment was attended by 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an intractable role.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group, which washed their hands after the setback, gave a far more optimistic impression than the one where its participants' hands were nothed.
The group also "with washed-up hands" did better in the next test than the other.
Yet those who washed their hands, in the next tests, achieved worse results than those who did not have them washed.
The results of the "artifold" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not record any previous failure.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical cleanliness removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, motivation is decreasing, with the testers having to focus much more in the next tests.
If we had transferred the research results to the Czechs, perhaps the most optimistic would be when we returned from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs are not washing their hands, but along the way through the city transport it is a fifth.
Hygienas are mostly also adhered to after work in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 per cent of people wash their hands.
The baby pet's baby motivates 78.7 percent of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after a hand-shaped to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks will wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a bit better," commented the survey results of the skin doctor Klaudie Komárková.
A tunnel for drug smuggling was found between the US and Mexico with its own railroad
It has been able to discover one of the most sophisticated drugs smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and an electric railway.
U.S. officials described a tunnel measuring roughly one by one meter as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever discovered.
The tunnel, which winds to a length of nearly six football pitches, connects a warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego, USA.
This area is full of indeterminate warehouses, where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before the drugs could be brought in undetected.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine to distribute them.
If convicted, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In the town of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are infiltrating extensive drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which puts the problem of how to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible before the drug cartels.
In 2010, the authorities found a corridor of about 650 metres furnished with tracks that ran from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
Is Europe's elite ready for trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign (a trade for Britain) was launched in April with the promise to bring together businesses and define what changes in the relationship with the EU to see British entrepreneurs and job creation companies.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked the leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov interviewed 1,000 leading businessmen representing British businesses of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritising new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than plunging into a long and arduous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When we asked for their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels' regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trade area - even with 40 per cent of large enterprises, the most pro-European companies, traditionally the most pro-European companies, who have already given their consent.
Finally, our business leaders survey revealed the most telling knowledge, that the unequivocal majority wants Britain to seek to amend the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not policy.
The findings, with which businesses of different sizes and the main business groups have identified, show that the business sector is pushing for a "meaningful change" that will bring back influence to Britain.
There is a big deal at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better agreement for Britain can mean a profit of up to 16% in the vote in the referendum to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British membership of the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift from the current balance of power back to the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and increasingly necessary, given the eurozone's path as a narrower economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be for jobs and growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, for business it means a re-oriented focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.

The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2's work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said she would "twine the UK together" the project.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he had been "excited" by working with the British Government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase Two, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from £32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion.
The British government, which held talks with the national transport agency Transport Scotland, instructed HS2 to find out additional rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for the North and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: 'Our goal for the HS2 is really the national network that will better connect the UK and its cities.'
We gave the SH2 the green light because the benefit it will bring is enormous.
Without this, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
However, it is also a link – across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected thanks to the UK.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added, "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
Under the Scottish Government, Mr. Carmichael called on Mr Carmichael to "unambiguously" support for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: ‘The trek-speed line has the potential to bring immeasurable economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the overall case of the high-speed rail across Britain.'
So we are enthusiastically working with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed rail to Scotland and thus benefiting everyone and adding the Glasgow-Edinburgh route, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study, together with the British Ministers, over the next year and the joint decision-making on the next steps.
Frontier Airlines is about to charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to USD 100 on its flights for storing a hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to USD 100 for hand luggage and USD 2 for a coffee or soda, although they said in their announcement on Wednesday that passengers would be able to keep the whole can.
The new hand luggage fee applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so the small luggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if the passengers are waiting to be paid until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to charge this fee," she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second baggage handlers in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these fees and stuffed them into the carry-on luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so that there was often no room in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the purpose of this new fee was not really to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier's most lofty customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company's website will not be valid.
This means that one passenger queued at the Frontier gate can bring in the luggage for which he will pay nothing, while the other ticketed queue for the same bag pays $100.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures would be modified to ensure that passengers learned about the fee before arriving at the gate.
Frontier's new fee for hand luggage will not yet be in force before the summer, but a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
She argues that handling luggage costs money, and the passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street view another baggage fee as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air traffic after years of loss.
Most, however, did not touch the charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost company, Allegiant Air, followed its example later.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that the pay for hand luggage to Spirit would bring in USD 50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former senior executive at Midwest Airlines, was flying with Spirit recently, wondering what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual payment from Spirit for hand-held baggage.
"Assetting on a plane was the most leisure I've ever seen in my air career," he said.
I expected to see teeth gnashing and arguments at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the boarding took place in an instant."
Frontier will also apply the fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, along the lines of Spirit.
Frontier said that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and the coffee will be replenished for free.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to introduce beverage fees in 2008, but backed away from it seven months later after complaints from passengers, and no major airline subpoenaed it.
Frontier's latest move to charge for hand-checks if a passenger does not purchase a flight directly from this airline is to direct customers directly to their website.
Airlines pay online travel dealers such as Orbitz from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, rather than doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone furthest in this area.
In September, it started giving customers who bought a travel agency via an online travel agency for only half a mile as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for the flying mile to 25 percent of the journey.
So a trip with Frontier, a 1,000-mile-long one purchased through an online travel agency, means a $250 million reward.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make the purchase directly via the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and lose money.
According to financial results reported Wednesday by company partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity shrank by almost 13 percent in the first quarter
By selling this airline, Republic is also trying to resolve Frontier's financial problems.
We've studied 11 TISSWN OF THE INZERTERS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured over 11,000 job-seeker-laying advertisements, of which 4300 were published in the daily newspapers and 6800 advertisements (62 per cent) on the internet.
The internet is thus becoming the most important media outlet for posting job offers.
As recently as 2005, when the survey was first conducted, his share was 26 percent.
In the last two investigations (2007, 2010), it has stabilised at around 60 per cent.
The advertisement of the employment options in themselves, according to the analysis, reflects a considerable degree of current situation on the labour market.
An example is the simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during periods of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same reporting period, up from less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the internet is geared towards a narrower, in particular a more skilled professional group.
By contrast, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including workers' professions, said the author of the analysis, Pavlína Šťastnová.
The degree of representation of selected professional groups is different for both media.
On the Internet, adverts attracted the focus of adverts seeking managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or leading small businesses was only on the internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, while a large representation is mainly due to the service and working-class professions.
The most frequently cited requirements that employers express through an advertising offer, of course, include education.
Other areas surveyed included a knowledge of foreign languages, in particular English.
In the daily press, the requirement to know a foreign language was made in three percent of the advertisements, 37 percent on the internet.
In only two percent of the advertisements were employers demanded active knowledge of the two foreign languages.
Claims for 'computer literacy' appeared in 40 percent of advertisements (in daily newspapers in 11 percent, on the internet in 57 percent).
Experience in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
Practice requirements are generally associated with skilled professions.
These are in particular the head of production and other managers.
For the blue-collar professions, it is mainly about mechanics and repairers or producers and processors of food products, or the author of the study, added the author of the study, Jiří Tillner.
Employers also set out in half of their adverts requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most frequently sought-after skills, communication skills have already appeared in the advertisement in the first place in the first place.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, autonomy, accountability, organisational skills and reliability.
A fifth of shopping centres face low attendance
This is according to data from the real estate consultancy Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre is opening to the public in Bohnice, Prague, the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centres in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centres.
The main problems are inadequately large centre-breaking location and bad layouts, i.e. too many floors or a complicated and messy arrangement of passages, or dead places of the centres," said Michal Soták from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to retail property department head Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the department stores are facing low attendance.
The main reasons include, among other things. poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or market oversaturrents in the place.
Some of the projects opened almost fully booked, but their results were mainly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, customers are a bit conservative and don't like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping centres must try harder to 'tack' their customers at new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," Samadi added.
The occupancy rate of shopping centres is generally stable, according to Soták, rising for some centres, as landlords were willing to discount their rent in the crisis and to doapj some units.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully booked and the average occupancy rate is reduced (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, Šantovka in Olomouc)," Soták added.
Shopping malls opened in the past two years have been a very slow market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
But there is a market place for new projects.
The number of sites suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
In Prague, for example, we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', focused on the purchase and services of daily use for the population living in the immediate vicinity," said Samadi.
According to Soták, there is also a place for other shopping centres on the domestic market.
This is for both small 'service' centres and for major projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or expansion in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, České Budějovice, Brno or Plzeň have room for further growth," Soták added.
In Prague he sees a space for the upcoming shopping centre on Victory Square, according to him they have a clear potential of Na Příkopě and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developing, which allows traders to be covered and expanded to smaller cities for friendly rents and operating costs, the space is still in some locations for smaller local or housing shopping centres, respectively their reconstruction such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubánková from DTZ.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centres in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square metres of rough lettable area.
A quarter of all these shopping centres are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centres, according to the number of tenants, nine are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags behind by about 50 square metres per thousand inhabitants.
Parents of teenage boy from Georgia who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of the teenage boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a coiled wrestling spirit in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the town of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a straightened ghost behind the bleachers in the high school gym where he attended.
The sheriff's investigators at the Lowndes County district concluded that Johnson died accidentally, but the family of the 17-year-old refuses.
"They are unequivocally convinced that their son was murdered," lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacququelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he'd died the way the sheriff said he had.
"They believe it goes against logic, the laws of physics, and also the common sense," Crump said.
They believe that this is to cover up what really happened in order to protect the person responsible for their son's death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school, and he came back in a body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions had gone unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
said Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is sufficient basis for a routine investigation," he said.
Moore told the newspaper that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "send-up choking."
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, gave a different cause of death.
"There are several question marks that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence in the Johnson case to investigate the crime or violation of civil rights, he would ask the FBI and its implementation.
A deputy to the Sheriff's Office from the Lowndes precinct was not immediately available for commenting on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the surveillance camera videos that investigators had examined.
The teenager's parents hope the video footage will include a clue leading to the discovery of their son's death.
Report: Obama campaign considered swapping Biden for Hillary Clinton
The next adviser to President Barack Obama, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton on the 2012 ticket.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times magazine obtained a copy of the incoming book and announced Thursday evening that the president's senior ausps had hosted intense group meetings and surveys in late 2011 to estimate whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama's fading hopes of re-election.
According to the Times's National Political Compatter, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials within the campaign, and in the White House, namely Bill Daley's former White House chief of staff, to measure the effect on the election of the move of former Secretary of State to Vice President.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign's infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Just a few of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – were known to consider the change.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move when the data showed that adding Clinton to the ticket would "not raise Obama's chances substantially."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been researching a whole lot of things intensively, and this was one of them," he told the Daley.
You mustn't forget that the president had a terrible prospect at the time, so we were like, "Christ, what are we supposed to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as "appropriate care," Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had made considerable investment to see if the move would be worth it in the election.
"In campaigns, that kind of money is not spent on elections and qualitative research unless something is really being seriously considered," Martin said on AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering the exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential binge of the cards.
While Daley said he did not think the president was "aware of the potential changes," the former office manager admitted that it was "possible" to be known to Obama.
Martin added that the book "Double down" does not finally answer the question of whether the political probe reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought he was aware of the research into removing Biden from the ticket.
"Maybe," Martin said.
No, Mr. Hasek.
We have a unique way to tell politicians that this is not the case.
Pressure is to be put in place to relieve Martin Hašek of all political positions and leave the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already slim.
Martin Hašek is shielded by the promise he made, but everyone and politician in particular need to be aware of the consequences of the promise and give great consideration to what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital the politician has (Mr Babiš also has the tangible one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The self-improvement program championed by the liar is untrustworthy.
He's not apologizing in politics, he's stepping down in politics.
Mr. Hashka, if that's what you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements make me sure you don't, if you weren't lying right now - here you see how difficult it is with the lie), you leave politics yourself, like a man.
People will then accept your apology as the expression of the man who made the mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless weakling whose words or actions cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be a proud, if erring, person or a lifelong sket.
It may seem to you to be unfair when I only address you, but you are the leader and they are just misguided sheep.
And you're the leader and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you're trying to lower your ears for a while, regroup your strength, sit out the embarrassment, and then attack again, but that's what the guerrillas or the backstabber's act.
You, I repeat, in your eyes, a leader, the alpha male, behave like one.
Accept responsibility and get out of politics.
The black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find the money to repair the crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black cabinet that fits easily into your car's dashboard.
The devices that track every kilometre the motorist drives, and which transmit this information to the authorities, is at the heart of Washington's and state-planning authorities' controversial efforts to renovate an outdated US major-road funding system.
Usually, the bland design of the highways suddenly sparked an intense debate and the emergence of a variety of leeries.
The Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these small cabinets to record the miles traveled and perhaps where you were going – and then using that information to compile a tax cut-off.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Union for Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy problems.
And while Congress cannot agree whether to continue, some states are not waiting for anything.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they can move to the system in which the driver pays per kilometre of the road he's on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
"This is not a matter of which we can choose too much," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to start tracking the miles traveled by every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The impetus is that the Road Trust Fund, funded by the taxes that Americans pay for at the petrol stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
Cars can travel a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of petrol, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax by just one cent.
"The petrol tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
Its state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this system of paying for the mileage.
"In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user charge by the number of kilometres travelled.
It is no surprise that the idea is enjoyed by urban liberals, as taxes can be used to change driver behaviour patterns, which, for example, can help reduce traffic jams and greenhouse gas creation.
California designers look to the system in planning strategies to meet the targets set out in the ambitious Global Warming Act.
But Republican Bill Shuster (deput to Pennsylvania), chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also saw it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market officials at the Reason Foundation are also in favor of the idea that drivers will pay for the kilometres travelled.
"It's not a tax that disappears into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, the vice president of strategy at the organization's Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former US transport ministers who encouraged Congress in 2011 to go in the direction of paying per kilometre.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives' leadership rejected the proposal and did so because of concerns from rural lawmakers representing the population's components, whose daily life often means traveling many miles to work outside the city.
But a few states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
The scoreliest is Oregon, which has included 5,000 drivers in the country's biggest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a tax on the mileage, instead of tax on petrol.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is researching the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent for trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state ministries of transportation, along with coastal states to the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement the change.
But this concept has no supporters.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
"Fearing concerns about the Big Brother-type surveillance and a similar issue were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads the management of strategy and operations at the Department of Transportation in the non-Gaid.
It wasn't something that people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union warned in Nevada on its website: "It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices."
There is no need to build a vast, cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be extended to the record of daily trips and the arrival of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find the available technology to enable the state to track how many kilometers the car will go, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage (real distance travelled).
This firm was originally not involved in the action to help the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market for legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they would drive.
But this device that tests attracts the attention of the road network's designers because it does not use GPS and delivers only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded by a modem.
"People will be willing to go for it unless you're following their speed and their location," says Ryan Morrison, True Mileage's CEO.
Some of these pilot programmes have produced a number of major errors.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, the designers experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage travelled by all the residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accept this concept if the device is able to do more, no less.
In the city of New York, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay for parking meters, to provide insurance by the mileage and to collect the speed data of other drivers, so that motorists can avoid traffic.
"The motorists will be willing to take part in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them," the city's design document says.
However, some transport designers would like to know whether all discussions about paying per kilometre are just a giant proxy.
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Committee in the San Francisco Bay area say Congress could very easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the petrol tax increase.
A one-off or annual tax could be levied on drivers of hybrids or other cars that do not consume much of the fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"No radical operation is needed if you can take the aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislaturalist and Public Affairs Committee.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Which billionaire are you going to phone with next year?
Kellner, the owner of PPF Group, wants to buy O2 operator.
Both firms confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from the agencies and from the backstage, the hand is said to be up in the sleeve.
The announcement of the transaction is expected to come in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequencies auction, before 11 November.
Kellner's competitor, Karel Komárek, owns the KKCG Group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, it embarked on an auction of frequencies for LTE networks.
And to a general surprise, until then, the company's appetite for leaps and communications had not been mentioned.
But Sazka is now led by a very experienced telecommunications maverick Robert Chvátal.
He started out as the marketing chief of the Radiomobile (today T-Mobile), then became director of T-Mobile, Slovakia, and most recently headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She applied for auction and now admitted to launching a virtualist at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Vodafone would probably not like that under normal circumstances, but according to Hospodářské noviny, this may be part of the much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of rival O2 and T-Mobile operators, who will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that may be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender for LTE networks (as a newcomer, it can auction a specially designed spectrum), Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not mind the auctioning of only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for all).
Vodafone and Sazka can share the networks.
Vodafone will release Sazka to its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz), allowing the company to start the network quickly.
In between, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network that Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The money saved could then be spent by Vodafone on some fixed internet or cable TV provider.
And Kellner?
He would buy the Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the Czech one's daughter) immediately acquired a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big mogul that's going to be expected to restructure.
In the auction, Kellner would have won the LTE networks for O2 and, very likely, in conjunction with T-Mobile.
Both firms have already declared that networks will be shared.
The auction could thus finally end in success, but quite probably not with the high amounts enjoyed by the state budget.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between a call with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Komárek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained in Russia since September over a protest against planned oil drilling in the Arctic have been shipped from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
AFP reported the news today, citing the international environmental organisation Greenpeace.
It also claims that the original allegations of its piracy activists have not yet been dropped.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women, detained in Russia after a nonviolent action against an oil rig in the Arctic, were transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg," the organization announced in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to DPA, it was a planned move.
Authorities first charged environmentalists with piracy, for which they faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
But last week, they announced that the charge would be replaced by a more lenient riot service, which carries a lower sentence with a lower sentence of seven years imprisonment.
But Greenpeace pointed out in a statement today that the charges of piracy have not yet been dropped by the authorities, as they have promised.
That means the detainees are now charged with two felonies.
The powerful Committee of Investigations announced last week that it would replace the charges of piracy by accusations of disorderly conduct.
But when the 30 prisoners faced the committee this week, the charge of piracy was not dropped.
Instead, a new charge was filed against each," AFP quoted a Greenpeace statement as saying.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at the Gazprom oil rig in mid-September.
The environmentalists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which was flying the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been remanded in custody, against which they have appealed, but the court has dismissed them all.
Environmentalists complain about the conditions of the imprisonment.
According to AFP, Greenpeace's CEO Kumi Naidoo said today that the move to St. Petersburg would facilitate a meeting between those withheld and consular workers.
But there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"They can actually be worse," he said.
The aid was requested by the Dutch king Willem-Alexander by one of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen.
In a handwritten letter published today by the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, it called on the monarch to speak out about their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a mobster against a police investigation is in prison
Basharat Ditta (42) was to pass information on to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared his drug addiction would come out.
A Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who briefed a drug mobster on a major police investigation because he was afraid his drug addiction would come out was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) was supposed to be giving the head of the underworld to Neil Scarbrough's undercurrent information to the head of the underworld, after becoming a suspect in his drug smuggling activities.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was hailed by the criminals as the best legal guard, was arrested at his home in his home after police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he represented in previous narcotics proceedings.
Officers saw Sarborough (32), leave three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Blackburn, which had just been at dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on tests to find traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of a Class A drug.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried to covertly gather information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being tracked at the time as part of a major investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After police intercepted about £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, along with a total of GBP 1,000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in prison with them.
Ditta (42) passed the information to criminals for fear of his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at the Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, had a shameful time before the Liverpool Crown Court when, after a three-week trial, he was found guilty of defending justice in two cases.
During an earlier hearing, he confessed to holding cocaine.
The lawyer's downfall came after a police investigation by Scarborough found that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's home, and spotted him placing drugs about the purity of 60 percent under the lawyer's black golf gaunt.
Subsequently, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers Stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home to find the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two.
The court heard that traces of the A-grade drug were found in his hair, wallet and his credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, and said he spoke to the suspect dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell under "confidential communication."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
During the police interview, he said he ran an office at both his home address and at the workplace, and that clients had also visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Whoever else is more aware that he must not violate the law other than the criminal prosecutor."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as an attorney and of getting in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here is not just about the drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who's supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He obstruwed the police investigation as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession; he disgraced it.
He became too close to his clients, especially with Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta dismissed the offence, saying, "If I were a corrupt lawyer I am not, and I would like to give Mr. Scarborough information, I would not have waited 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately."
However, after the hearing, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said, "Mr. Ditta himself became a criminal from the criminal attorney himself when he started getting drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading representatives of organized crime groups, which tasked him with gathering valuable information about the police investigation.
Legal advocates must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and are to inspire confidence and the public feel that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire has conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of cocaine possession and now for obstructing the administration of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing the criminal to justice.
This case should serve for all criminals as a warning that no one is beyond the reach of the law's hands.
We'll find you and bring you to our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being declared guilty of collusion for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another thirty-five people involved in the trade were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, saying that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death block in America, as a guest at dinner he would like Mohammed Ali to be and cited inequality as motivation for the job.
Obama backs away from healthcare
After a wave of criticism, President Obama backed away from hist-repeated and ambitious promise yesterday that "if you like your health program, you can keep it."
Citing hundreds of thousands of reports of testimonies from providers Republicans have accused the president of deleveraging the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama flinched from his original promise.
"The vast majority of people who have functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in his speech in Boston.
Considering what he called a "message in the media" about the testimonies, Obama called on the Americans who received these announcements to search for new safeguards in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than anticipated.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not come as a surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchased the insurance for themselves can be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements given by the Affordable Care Act.
"I'm telling these Americans to this: you deserve better," Sebelius said in her testimony to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet market had been "inhabiating" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to win back your trust.
The irritated Sebelius phrase, which was picked up by the microphone on, spoke yesterday in the direction of the adviser sitting behind her at the Committee's meeting yesterday, which took place after a turbulent exchange with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, about whether she, too, had to join the Obama program of care herself.
For more than three hours during the hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly lashed out at the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up on government-sponsored insurance, and did not forbade the program through HealthCare.gov, which is now imposing on millions of Americans.
He travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in the countries of West Africa; just one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 female candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes Award, you can vote for him or any other of the top ten main candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Cameroon's capital city, Yaounde, in 1981.
At first he was treated only with a broken arm, but subsequently developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he created a hematoma that had caused problems for him all his life.
"There weren't any neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him outside of Cameroon if we had the money to do it.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received the kind of treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., hurry to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first to be.
There are many patients.
Some people only die because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, things have not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per population.
And even if the Cameroonian doctors could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two of the country's five people live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's healthcare expenditure is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
With the sake of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon doctor at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the nonprofit organization ASCOVIME, whose members attend rural areas over the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped his group of volunteers with nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are packed in vans, attaching medical supplies to the rooftops, and travel through rough terrain to villages that need help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles must be pushing through the river and the mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome as real heroes: a feast, a singing and a dance, and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
In these villages, medical care is really a free reason to celebrate, and Bwelle, with his broad smile and unbridled energy - is very willing to join the local merriment.
The next day, the team begins nursing hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition," Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a 60-kilometer radius, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide various medical assistance.
Many are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a free birth certificate – a document required by the school, but which many miserable families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team does simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in a school building, at the town hall or at home; after the surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make way for the next patient.
Using the generator light, the operating room and the sanitary facilities of Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose their motivation.
"To stay awake and keep working, they play the drums all night long," Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free surgeries last year, realizing that their help could mean a lot to local residents.
One man said he would be able to work again after the hernia operation.
"That will change our family's future," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for the private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says it is this second job that funds about 60% of his nonprofit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
"I'm not sure when she's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is in her second year of medics at the Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteers for Bwelle's group.
He's always in the hospital or he's trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it's a great practice they wouldn't get at home.
"We were washing Dr. Bwelle thoroughly and removing blood stains or holding his instruments," says O'Malley.
As a second-year medical student in America, you'll never get to know.
Students volunteers usually pay for their own trip to Cameroon and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But as soon as they reach Yaounde, food, transport, and study, Bwelle provides them with.
"He's a hero, no doubt," says O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the constant struggle is not a burden.
To help others live happily, to fulfill the promise he made to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," Bwelle says.
And I think about my father.
I hope he can see what I'm doing.
To laugh at people, to alleviate their pain - that's why I'm doing it.
Check the ASCOVIME website and you'll find it as much as you can help.
Central banks to keep swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent tool to allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need.
The banks made the comments in their joint statement.
"This is a very sensible step," commented Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays, a London bank.
"So far, all the transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is not surprising to me," adds Vojtěch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are reinforcing the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market falters for the first time.
Central bank agreements have allowed access to euros, dollars, and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
Central bankers' decision comes at a time when the US Fed is preparing to end its US-economy support program, which could drive the price of money in the global market even higher.
By default, the swap contract is used to overcome the liquidity shortages of one currency, with the current liquidity surplus of the other currency.
It can be seen as a repository for one currency and a loan of currency to another.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to return confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed to a banking supervision, with the ECB overseeing 150 banks.
Number of HIV infections exceeds 1,000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infections grows every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed an infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and by 2010 there were 180 of them.
Last year, there were 212 infections and it was a record number.
"The fact that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200, I don't think there is any doubt," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who ran the Prague House of Light for Patients for Professionals for years.
According to him, 165 HIV patients were added in the country last year from January to September, with 176 over the same period this year.
From the beginning of the follow-up until the end of this September, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, 206 infected residents.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from the Moravian-Silesian or 116 from Ústí nad Labem.
The fewest in those infected come from the Highlands, there were 19.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with a blood transfusion in the past.
Such a case, however, has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of the testing, i.e. more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, and transferred to them from their mother.
Children should learn to myths and legends as "models for the way of life," says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that "gross power cannot be equal to clever cunning," while the arthis legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Much of myths would be "more wild for teaching at school, far too scandalous and, in some cases, too obscene," said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of works of the appropriate age.
"I think it's great that myths and folk creations are already part of education," he said.
I have defended this plan for 20 years.
He added that the "openly instructive" authors and teachers are a "subdued" message for children in an engaging story with a "switch" message.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon, and who also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Tories, says: "You may have good intentions, but you will do better to keep them to yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is taking some sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end in a happyend, but there must be a natural sense of purpose and of evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly established.
The old truth about showing it better than to describe.
Miloslava Cejpková: November's smile
It came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not used to yet.
First she put down her smile, the one she kept on display as a defense against the would-be friendly surroundings.
That made her very feel better, because it was a mask she'd decided not to put off in public.
He was only sincere at home on the days when she grandmothered and had grandchildren Elinka or Adíka around her.
And, of course, when her sons phoned her.
She remembered very well the lesson of endless trading skills courses.
Now they were finally in handy.
So she doesn't grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into the corner.
Like a costume to a costume party.
November, or another month, can't do the miracle to really smile, like they did when they were on the trip with the one who hasn't been around for almost three years.
Pierre Rainera: I try to make Cartier's style evolve like a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition while leading our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier, explains in an interview with HN.

GM is pulling down some new light trucks in the US to repair the seat backrests
According to a Friday announcement by the U.S. Automotive Safety Authority, General Motors is withdrawing nearly 19,000 of its new (2014), the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra's light trucks to repair the fault with the manual tilt of the backrest.
For some of these vehicles, the front-seat tilting mechanism may be a fault.
As a result, the seat backs are not in line with the federal standards of automotive safety for headrests.
A notice posted on the StateSurric Safety Administration's website on the Road (NHTSA) says that "if the car gets hit from behind, the headrest may not properly protect the passenger, which increases the risk of injury."
The downloaded models were made between August 1 and September 10.
GM made the shipment available in June and is the most important launch for the leading US automaker since restructuring to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery owner of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the announcement to the owners because of the government's 16-day dysfunction, which weakened the growth in car sales in October.
Sales of deliveries of the Silverado and Sierra, which were revised for the 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 of the Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models, from its deliveries.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Too inquisitive newspaper to be investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
New Express, based in Guangzhou, made a rare public petition to release journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to make up stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The administrator said the New Express newspaper would now make a "full correction."
The regulation for "replaced" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong Province.
A preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, New Express newspaper from the Yangcheng group Evening News had published several false reports of the said company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was disorderly," the administrator said in his statement.
He said he had to decide to "have Chen Yongzhou's administrative punishment in the form of the cancellation of the journalism license."
He also "arrived the Yangcheng group Evening News to carry out a general correction to New Express, and recommended that the relevant people in charge in New Express be examined and immediately change the management of the New Express paper."
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express on financial irregularities in a building equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper issued two requests for his release on the front page, claiming he was behind his journalism's work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and confessed to making false stories for the payment.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and also to the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust," he told the state news broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was hungry for money and fame.
I realize I've acted badly.
After Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued an excuses on the front page in which it said it had failed to do a sufficient check of his reports.
Recently, several high-profile suspects have been admitted to television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly coerced, regardless of a change in the law this year, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
With the growing misery of the middle class, pawnshops are taking place in Singapore
At a pawnshop in the Bendemeer shopping cent in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's tuition.
"My husband and I just bought the house and I put all my money on it," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 of SGD (SSAD) every month as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family's monthly monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is such that ValueMax, where the woman is making her transaction, became the third pawnshop on the list this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quicker route to borrowing cash - the SGD 1300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga - but is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The Singapore pawnshops routinely apply an annual percentage rate of 17 per cent, just above the 15.4 per cent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, paestrials have the advantage of not requiring the person to be verified or proof of income, and they can provide a loan faster than the banks.
And that is why, as families feel pressure about rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit backed by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households, mainly because of the increasing rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in view of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about the high level of consumption debt in Thailand, which this week just came out of the technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with increasing costs, people from the middle to the low [revenge scale] will try to replenish their income wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia's CIMB Bank.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to people hastily stopping their personal assets and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family's jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in the city's 200 stalworship are gold.
People say: the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's golden necklace and get it back next month.
The largest pawnstrike operator in Thailand, EasyMoney, recorded a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
Growth in the pawnbridge sector is so large that ValueMax, the branch's operator in the centre of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax Executive Director Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of SGD's 66 million on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount creditors have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the pledge offers lower rates not only lower than other creditors, but also does not directly increase the debt.
"Customers are stopping items they already own, and the realisation of personal property does not increase the household's debt," he says.
In the company, the pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means to provide short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, among those who use the pawnshops, it is not just people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use the ValueMax branch when they stop the Rolex's gold rods or watches, allowing them to reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are from all sorts of backgrounds.
"They are the ranks of rich individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of their bold shops or investments, or small businesses that need help solving the problems in their cash flow," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as fast as they can.
The NSA website's downfall is not blamed by hackers but by the "internal flaw"
The mysterious National Security Agency reported last Friday that its website crashed for several hours last week due to an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some claimed online.
"The NSA.gov posters were not open for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be eliminated during the evening.
The claim that the outage was caused by an attack by DDoS (distributed service rejection) is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA website had not worked for at least six hours, and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
Previously, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the internal sensitive networks of the agency had not been "at a global risk.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacking activists claimed online that it was responsible for disposing of the NSA's sites through a DDoS attack.
The DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overlapped and the site is dropped.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple, and the purpose of attacks is not to penetrate the target system's internal network.
The former NSA's super-secret agency, which was once dubbed No Like an Agency, has become the focus of public attention in the past few months following a string of revelations in foreign and domestic surveillance programs, and the target of a biting critique of the product of the NSA's secret NSA files and their disclosure by the disillusionmented former employee Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency prompted earlier speculation that today's accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of HIV infections in Prague exceeded one thousand
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the start of the 1986 surveillance to the end of this year's third quarter, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to statistics from the national AIDS reference laboratory at the National Institute of Health.
According to her, there were 2,063 infections throughout the Czech Republic so far.
In 396 immune deficiency illnesses have already broken out.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year in the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, the examination revealed 156 new infections and in 2010 it was 180.
The number dropped to 153 the year before last, but it was a record-breaking last year.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"I don't think the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year, I don't think there's any doubt," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavatý, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for Professionals for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people and 47 last year, Hlavatý said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed by 1710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has broken out in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of this country: presidents on the brink of power
It is almost a rule that, at the country's key moments, the head of state was not in the form of being able to fulfil his stateccordial duties.
If he were T. Masaryk, physically and mentally, five years younger, would live to see the end of his presidential term, and the events surrounding Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We probably wouldn't have won the war, but after a symbolic backlash, the air force could fly across the border, the heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London right away and not struggle to fight laboriously for its legitimacy.
And most of all, the nation would not have had a hangover from that surrender to this day.
Beneš was not a statesman and was still in shape for Munich, but it started to go downhill with him during the war and behaved accordingly in February 48.
To be a little better, he could go into exile for the third time and undermine the legitimacy of the communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hách.
They elected him, saying that "the president will not get into a situation of deciding."
But he had to, though it probably wasn't, with a knife to his throat at Hitler's chancellery.
The head of intelligence, František Moravec, until the last days in March 1939 said what should be done, so that the occupation, which he knew exactly on the day, did not go so smoothly and with such a profit for the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, both did not believe him, and were afraid.
The human wreck, Gottwald, had his age-old fellow-comrades execute, as Moscow had told him.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitely barred by the share of normalisation and they had to depose him, already completely senile.
That Husák was powerless and the sick depressing old man facilitated the events in November 89, but that is the only positive.
Havel was lucky to have not met him in office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus may still be a fresh tennis pensioner, but many of his actions suggest that thought processes are not what they used to be.
Now here's this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces look like what he looks like and we don't know all that yet.
Fortunately, there is no threat to the Republic's external threat now.
Or maybe it's threatening, just not to see.
Then the question is whether, exceptionally, it is not (in historical terms) as well as the president not entirely at strength.
But it is not a normal state.
Couldn't we elect someone who, acceptably, as receptively thinking and conventionally healthy, in this country, as a president, again?

Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
TOP 09 President Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the last one in an interview with Aktuálně.cz, he said there was no other way out of the vote, and every government resulting from last Friday's vote and Saturday was an impossible patchwork.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, estimating the lifestyleship period's lifetime within two years.
He disagrees with the objection that voters will hardly choose in a very different way next time, "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the TOP 09 president does not admit that his party could still lose voters in the next election as it did this year (it lost some 300,000 votes compared to 2010.
Schwarzenberg estimates that should it be clear within two months that the early elections will be held, it will strengthen the ANO 2011 movement of Andrej Babiš.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babiš will be losing ground.
The turbulent situation in the ČSSD, where the chairman, Bohuslav Sobotka, said after a secret meeting of the party leadership in the party leadership that either he or Michal Hašek would remain in the leadership of the Social Democracy, Schwarzenberg comments in his own way:
"Hearing for the leaders of the democratic party as little boys go to the head of state to allow them to take a coup in the party."
"I thought Mr. Hasek was more skilful and intelligent."
"Because I have never seen anything so impatiently performed in my life," added the chairman of TOP 09.
And in the direction of President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the fight for the presidency), he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take the party's seizure."
The first laws have already been tabled by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you personally?
TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the House of Commons, including the Farsky Register of Treaties, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with the early elections.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the TOP 09 chairman argues that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are needed."
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the ANO election leader, Martin Komárek, accused TOP 09 of the election fight that the idea of introducing a register of treaties "craising" the ANO program.
TOP 09 took advantage of the lead now - it simply brushed off a proposal that had already been poised for a second House reading.
Coulson hacked into the phone to check out the tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used the methods of "tramming into the phone, watching and confronting" to confirm a fraudulent tip for the love affair that was to involve then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
U.S. Attorney Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that the News of the World newspaper captured fake news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed the private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemail and break into her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson, too, had called her and left her with voice messages.
"The prosecutor suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now NotW's editor, is not the man in front of the house, hoping to catch people out there, but a person who likes to give people the stories to see what they say," said Mr Edis.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
He obviously knows about the other one, the surveillance, he must know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about hacking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "Oh, of course he does."
The rumors about the love affair that Clarke is involved were first captured by the NotW newsletter when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, "You're wasting your time, she's with Charles."
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions, was obtained at Mulcair's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found the records on the private investigator's computer, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as "Projects."
During the time Ms. Pawlby was under investigation, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls in asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief correspondent Neville Thurlbeck and former correspondent James Weatherup were overseeing the monitoring of Ms Pawlby's movements.
Coulson eats 18. In June 2005, he left a voice message in which he told her: "I got the story we're about to publish tomorrow and I would love to talk about with Charles."
Mr Edis says that Coulson's involvement in the story was based on the same model as other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The court heard in court on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett for a love affair with a married woman, while he himself was seeing co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied collusion with other people to hack into the phones in the period from 3. October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hacking into the phone.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of New York's Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It could be argued that the city of New York is the place where a solo comic performance was born in America: almost a century ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the people of the chatter's point of conversation.
Fay's innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Festival comedy.
The festival, founded and run by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the solo comedy Carolines, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year - along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of these titles appeared in the Carolines and became successful to the point where they are too big to be played at the club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes" (starring heroes), an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, featuring, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
Just as this festival has expanded, the world of comedy has spread.
Several comedians attending this year's festival came from non-traditional channels such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll rose with his sitcom (the cheerle's spicy "League" to a fantastic-football theme on the FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both the "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation" program, but was most famous for her fast-shrouming series of "Marcel the shell with shoes on" films.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognisable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the snide, racially oriented by W. Kamau Bell), is the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will speak to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial historian of the comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting is held at Town Hall in Midtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he walks down the aisle between two buildings sometimes and he's like, man, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Many things have moved, and it's different.
For example, the commentator Pečinka spoke in such a way that one could agree with it, whereas Chairman Štěch was stirring up a discord.
The commissioner, Chovanec, was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau and confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the misery of the ČSSD.
The other gentlemen showed off their weaknesses in the main thing.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and readable and unusable, with Vice-President Zaoralek making it the most impossible to interview on television.
On the basis of this, I do not see a better option than for the ČSSD to propose Senate Vice-President Gajdůšková as Prime Minister, the only one would not have had an initial handicap and I think she would perform at a standard.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support him.
I would add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done and to proceed without breaking the party.
Alena Gajdůšková could safely form a minority government with a mere blessing from President Babiš and without the Peoples, but with the People's Minister of Health, Hovorka, who is actually a religious social democrat.
This mini-state government would have great stability, because it would enforce a proper referendum law, and such a commitment to support the President of the Dawn, Okamura.
In the end, President Babiš would accept the progression of the taxes, as he is keen and sees that it cannot be done without it.
The Peoples would not bring problems, because Hovorka is the recipient of the best they have, and they would not be in the government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, there would be a valuable minister, too, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but will provide support, also well.
Let's give courage to Alena Gajdůšková!
The detention of Bárta is related to Janoušek and Bém: Is he behind the leak of the wiretaps?
The chairman of Public Affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested by the police on Thursday.
Along with him, the head of the Department of Analysts and Informatics of the Anti-Corruption Police, Jan Petržílek, was detained.
The detainees are linked to wiretaps of lobbyist Roman Janoušek and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the wiretaps, which was contacted by news server Novinky.cz, was confirmed by a trusted source to the Czech Press Agency.
The intercepted phone calls by Janoušek and Bém published last March by the daily Mladá fronta Dnes, in which the two men address each other "Mazánka" and "Kolibříku," show Janoušek's influence on the actions of the city under Bém's leadership.
The daily reported at the time that they were procured in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which they leaked to the ABL security agency two years later.
It was then owned by Barta.
News.cz reported that the detained criminologist Petržílek worked for the BIS before joining the anti-corruption police.
Petržílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which was subsequently involved in the interception, at the same time it was published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravský of the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
He and Vít Bárta also detained an anti-corruption police officer
Bart's defense attorney, Oldřich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption by VV deputies, did not want to comment too much on the case either, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter as well, but I cannot comment further, given the protection of the classified information."
According to Právo, the case is being handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS).
The tn.cz reported that Bárta could have been buying classified information from the police.
According to the server úctu.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment Barta was allegedly sought.
But the Law's latest information shows that the detention of Vít Bárta is unrelated to Petr Lessy.
Police Presidium spokeswoman Eva Kropáčová declined to comment, saying the case was being handled by the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
"We will not comment on this inquiry in view of the protection of classified information," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, told Právo on Friday.
It is the prosecutor there who is overseeing Bart's case, and her words therefore implicitly imply that the file or the criminal proceedings are conducted under the secrecy regime.
The reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of Vít Bárta, Kateřina Klasnová, in front of their residence in Klárov, Prague.
She was loading her suitcases into her car and leaving.
She declined to comment on the incident.
On Friday morning, Dawn's leader, Tomio Okamura, commented on Bart's detention.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vít Bárta was one of many of the candidates of many parties on our ticket, and as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not even a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," he added.
Vít Bárta, who unsuccessfully ran for the Dawn of Direct Democracy movement of Tomio Okamura in the House of Representatives in the Pilsen Region, is known for his corruption case against the bribery of Public Affairs MPs.
In April 2012, he was sentenced to 18 months, suspended for 30 months.
The sentence was subsequently changed and Barta was acquitted.
Concerns about Mozambique's security escalate over the conflict between strong figures
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founding president of the Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo to call peace slogans at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, the managing director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she traded her corporate clothing for a T-shirt decorated with the words "we demand safety" in Portuguese and joined the crowd at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, news of the conflicts between the government forces and the Renamo party came almost daily, one of the worst fights since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, originally backed by the white government in Rhodesia and then the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 Peace Agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that an open conflict breaks out again in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
A rapidly growing economy is at stake, as the discoveries of large-scale coastal reserves of coal oil and coal deposits in the northwest may bring more than $50 billion worth of investments worth more than $50 billion over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale, Brazil's Brazil.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo have accused each other of the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party alleges that the government triggered the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members in the province of Sofala, the traditional Renamo Party stronghold on September 17.
The violent attack of the former rebels subsequently culminated in the warranty of attacking the Renamo party base and attempting to kill the Afons Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo Fernando Mazanga, told the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo to launch the conflicts because he is said to have attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to alleviate his fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told the French press office AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama had seen himself as a "lossskotka" who wanted to use "anything left of his strength to try to prove that he could order the government to make his own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo claim to want to avoid war.
But fears increased when Mr. Mazanga's words were quoted that the Renamo party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr. Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease the tensions between these parties, fuelled by a series of scuffles this year.
It's a skirmish between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator, and neither of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which sought electoral changes, has already commented that it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the dying movement to gain benefits and financial proceeds from the government.
Renamo's campaign stake has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Mozambique (DHM) movement, founded by a former member of the Renamo party, will improve its position in the election, as expected.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza – who is out of his second term next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a democratic system of multiple parties, he doesn't want a transparent election, he doesn't want to make peace because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options Renamo has, but has carried out divisive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key north-south road.
Most of the skoffins took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres away from Maputo's capital, but where is the city of Beira, a port on which the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, relies in its coal export.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad for about a week when the Renamo side threatened to attack the route.
Mr Mazanga would not comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community for the situation in Mozambique that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased the government's frustration, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also worried about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of abduction.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president, and that he is to be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultuane says people just want stability.
"None cares about Renama or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads," he says.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour Minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be under investigation by the State's Corruption Supervisory Committee.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied that he was changing the policy of the coastal lease at the request of his political advisor, Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on the government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday expanded its search to see if Mr Obeid had lobbied to a few state ministers to rent to the Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, without having to take part in a tender after his expiration in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the claim that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's clandestine interests in these properties, based on evidence presented on Thursday by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole.
Over the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed to go to public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, leases for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in the tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was the Minister of the ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a fan of the public tenders.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, Mr. Tripodi admitted, had urged a shift in government lease policy.
The transcript of the calls submitted to the ICAC showed the calls of August to September 2007 between Mr Obeid and Mr. Tripodim and Steve Dunne, the lead official who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Unit.
"Was he the subject of interviews during these phone calls the development of commercial leasing policy?" aide, aid commissioner, Anthony Wheala, asked Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but certainly not about this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
RIGHT, 1 November 2013
Dog summarized carpet, president tripped and ended up on crutches
On Thursday, President Miloš Zeman left the Motol Hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and left for the castle in Lány.
What kind of health is he in?
Cabbage bubbles in Kunovice, they don't add chemistry to it
They want to produce more than 1,000 tonnes of sauerkraut in the coming months in Slovácká Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and will last for about six months.
He has produced a healthy delicacy here since 1925 in the traditional way, i.e. stepping right in the big tanks.
In modern industrial times, it is a rarity.
Our female workers are on the shift for a nearly ten-kilometre route.
Each of the ten tanks can hold fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," said the director of the Slovácká Fruta plant, David Kladroba.
Cabbage mussels are brought to the company's premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostrožsk and Břeclavsk.
Fruta's employees then clean the vegetables, remove the broomsticks and throw them into the swing.
From there, the already sliced cabbage falls into pools of six metres in depth, at which pedalers tend to work tirelessly, dressed in white clothing and boots.
This oars the unwanted air.
The last trodden layer of cabbage is covered with a tarp and loaded with water.
"The noticeable hump is then aged for six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation substances," the director of Kladroba stressed.
The natural process corresponds to production in domestic conditions, with the individual layers absorbed by salt and cumin.
The cabbage after the fermentation travels to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet and sour brine for sachets or jars and subjected to sterilisation.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
It also registers interest in it in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Damks are said to be banned by UEFA from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chairwoman of the referees' committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing the sentences for the judges.
She is forbidden by UEFA rules, as she said in an interview with the daily newspaper Právo.
Otherwise, he said, the FACR would face penalties.
Damkova also refused to sideline the Socceroos from Pilsen, where she came from, in her role.
This speculation is really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example, from Prague.
So in the case of voting I can lose 1:6," Damkova said in response to the criticism that stormed after Plzeň has recently played twice as many penalties as the other league teams.
Thus, although the FACR has stopped publishing penalties for referees in recent months, Damkova assures that the referees are paying the price for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the board finds out that the referee made a mistake, he will restrict his delegation, whatever the match," Damk said.
The reason for not to be released is a ban on the European Football Union, according to Damka.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and punishes the breach harshly."
"We're very disgraceful, and we're looking for something behind every mistake."
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we don't stop doing this, there will be harsh sanctions," Damk said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
Should disclosure continue, the commission is said to be able to lose UEFA's money to educate and develop referees.
"And they are very important to us."
"Without them, we could not fulfill the program for referees' education," Damk added.
Does the internet mean the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit forecast and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base pre-tax profit to be between $325 and 340 million, compared to USD 305 to 315 million from the previous forecast.
If the current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17% increase in the 2011-12% record profit of US$250.4 million.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half of the year and began a sharp rise in the second half, mainly in Australian and British business travel.
"As of today, our 10 countries are profitable and several are moving towards a record annual profit before interest and taxation," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which is traditionally our greatest profit-makers.
Entrepreneurship with recreational activities has risen during the second half of the year in Australia, compensating for the slightly weaker domestic travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
US trade has recovered after a loss during the season's weaker half-year and is expected to make its third-round year in a row.
Flight Centre's shares were 3 cents higher yesterday at $38.20.
British police deliver extradition notice to Assange
British police today delivered a call for extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had delivered a "issued note" to the 40-year-old Australian, saying he was asking him to attend the police station and that if he did not, he could be threatened with arrest.
Assange has exhausted his options under the British law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sex crimes.
Fearing to be extradited to the US by Stockholm, he sought it out on 19. June's refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard "delivered the extradition notice to the 40-year-old man he asks to appear at the police station on the day and hour that was addressed to him," the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate the terms of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage because he has released 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The Supreme Court ruled: Nečas can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas could also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the dissolute of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by the procedural immunity that applies to speeches in the House.
On the contrary, in the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Mark Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, he ruled that they could not be punished for possible offences until they gave up their parliamentary mandate last November, said Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
The court's decision rejected the motion of the public prosecutor, Iva Izzard, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the MPs.
According to him, they accepted a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not causing problems in approving the laws.
On the contrary, the former prime minister who offered them these posts can be further prosecuted.
Aircraft manufacturers argue over the width of seats, big orders are at stake
There was a dispute between the aircraft's lead manufacturers over the width of seats in the second-class seats for long-distance flights, hinting at the bitter exchange of views at the Dubai air show earlier this month.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that airlines would usually be preceded by, but whose assigned space is the key to the demands for efficiency in the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industrial standards to offer at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but US main rival Boeing says airlines are to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing for sale the largest version of their twin-engine long-distance aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way the rear of the aircraft is disassembled - especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats side by side - is the basis for economic performance claims for proposals for new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the improved "777X" will transport 406 people in economic seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46-metre-wide economic seats spread out by 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
He recently tentatively showed what the start of a new advertising war might be when he showed financiers a picture depicting three people tweaked in a restaurant with the headline "Would you like to be hitting?"
"Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats closer than those in regional turboprop aircraft," said Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
As the eating habits change, people are bigger, but the seats on the planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air travel, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent until the turn of the century, according to data from the US Department of the Health Department.
According to American health statistics, the average American has a waist of 100 cm in the 21st century.
Airbus claims that its rival sticks to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average seat width of the newly christened aircraft was lower.
Airbus claims to have conducted research to indicate that the 2.5 cm seat expansion will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus seat dimensions and says it is under the authority of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export charges and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more matters than just the width of the seat.
"It really is about giving the airlines flexibility and enabling them to do things they believe they have to make them successful," said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
More space for elbows is essential for passengers, but it is a growing problem for suppliers that can affect yields.
Behind this dispute, the plant is in aircraft orders with an estimated deal worth at least $700 billion in the next decades at catalogue prices, enough to deflect the scales of the US and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to be 20 per cent better efficient for their latest designs for the twin-engined long-range aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
Boeing's performance demands depend in part on a comparison of the design of the 777X with the 10 seats in the row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in the row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat-folk concept.
"The reason Boeing does this is to pack more seats and make its planes more competitive than our products," said Kevin Keniston, the passenger's comfort for Airbus for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins with 10 seats in the row for the existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for the denser layout, which can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"The four-five-centimetre-wide seat would be great for the passengers, but the reality is that from the business point of view Airbus's design is motivated by the threat of the 777," said the cabin interior expert, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers to airlines to choose from.
The travelled aircraft dealers even carry with them a measuring band to check the competing order.
While I fancy comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a highly dense arrangement for low-cost companies and regional travellers.
The Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for a larger cabin to be modified by offering wider seats in the aisles on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of the only new manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industrial standards will remain unheard, but may deter the waves of 777X sales.
CME targets the TV business.
They release almost a quarter of the people.
Media group CME will be firing.
By the end of the year, he wants to slim down by a thousand people.
He intends to sew up all the ailing activities and only wants to focus on his core business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.
As a result, almost a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
CME is part of CET 21, which holds licenses to broadcast TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs around 650 people, and what it will mean for TV Nova's domestic TV number one, is not yet clear.
"This is premature and we really cannot comment on it," said Josef Koukolíček, director of communications at Nova.
According to MF DNES, significant redundancies in the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should be on the staffing levels of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both new bosses of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who joined long-time director Adrian Sarbu, talked during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday about wanting to curb all activities unrelated to the TV business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce the cost of producing its own programmes, the filmmaking and production activities in particular.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents of the defunct Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, on Thursday, a company that it had reaped at auctioning off in the Northel bankruptcy.
Rockstar, which bought $4.5 billion of Nortel's patents, was sued by Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. Circuit District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with violating seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps combine terms searched online with the relevant advertising, the lawsuit, which is the crux of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that operate on the Google Android operating system, which competes strongly with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a starting price offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the fight for Nortel's patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal motivated in part by Motorola's patents.
"Despite the failure of the auction to obtain the patents at issue, Google has violated and continues to violate the patents," the lawsuit reads.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because, in its view, Google's patent infringement is being committed intentionally, as the lawsuit alleges.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time, there is a warning that a condition for the independent Scotland's membership of the EU would be his accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to the stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along the Hadrian Wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but - as expected, this was not reflected in the headlines of the newspapers.
No one also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws to suit them.
With Scotland not being in Schengen now, the offer of an ongoing discrepancy would be a cheap retreat for Brussels for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old, he became an excavator. The journalist's duck that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is one interesting thought in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe at all?
Why trade the London yoke for the Brussels one, especially now?
This is a true European story: a great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
The euro crisis is caused by the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, a party dedicated to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency is gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the eurosceptic Alternative for Germany – founded this year – came as if from nowhere, and had already taken nearly five million votes in the federal election in September, effectively "sweating" the Freedom Democrats (the British Liberal Democrats' awards) from the Bundestag.
There has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe on home.
But the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the straitjacket put on to the national economies through the adherence to the common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments running a high budget deficit – that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates advantageous to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in domestic production compared to Germany.
The only aid is to cut revenue and public spending – which is prompted by Germany.
The current problems with the budget and the currency are due to the deeper cause of Europe's mourning performance.
As a result of the "green" energy policy supported by Brussels – the code for supporting French and German firms at the cost of consumers - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for petrol as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have seen in the Grangemouth case.
Even all the pay freezes in the world would not avert the trample on the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a smoldering mutiny, especially in France, once-enthated predecessors of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would be held in check by Germany and allow Paris to stand up to the level of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a card of political legitimacy, and has pushed through its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won major additional elections and relegated the ruling Socialists to third place.
The queue is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot conclude that the fission of the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen handle her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use next year's European elections to create an anti-European anti-sharecade-like anti-sharecade across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in this election, which is likely, such a bloc may dominate the European Parliament for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
It occurs to me that in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the common currency will come together and the euro will be wiped out.
The EU will not disappear, but will be transformed into something more looser in the sense of the 'Europe of the (Sovereign) Nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will re-establish their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and cling to the United States.
But Washington's increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
And where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area of (basically) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when to let us be.
I assume that Scotland would do well in a relaxed order of Europe, provided it retains its own currency.
Working with other like-minded countries would be simpler in the unfaturated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example from Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – oddly enough – the most successful political movement not enforcing austerity measures in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to an opposition stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to now vote for independence only to adopt austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Parents of intersex children can choose the 'different sex'
Germany became the first European nation to recognise the third sex in children born with ambiguous genital tract.
Newborn babies will no longer be ranked only for male or female.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any sexes for such children, and allows them to list their birth certificates of gender as "uncertain" or "unspecified."
The law aims to stop pressuring parents to make a hasty decision for a sex operation for their child and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.
An intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain a shrimp created by the doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year, of the 2,000 children, the one born neither boy nor girl.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, the umbrella term for those with atypical chromosomes, the gorces of the gorges (wailers or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
The intersexual could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender identification is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to identify the sex, it is better to use the best available information to determine it instead of waiting and to monitor the child's psychological and physical development until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender-specific problems, said the new German law "looks like a good thing."
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but it's not like that for most children," he said.
Identification of gender can be performed without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
Knowing how a child's sexual affiliation develops is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery as to why some people are gay.
The report transmitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersexuals as different from transgender or transgender people, because their status is not gender bound, but to a biological structure that is not exclusively male or female, but typically composed with both people and cannot be clearly defined as either of them.
These features can be reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair cover, bust and character, in the primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and the sex tract, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the work field, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys not responding to any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowed to identify adults in official documents male, female or "third genders."
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexless" person in June by winning a court appeal to retain the status of "non-certain" gender for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, in addition to M (man) and F (f. (female), the German passports will have a third designation, X, for intersex people.
In neighbouring France, according to a news report on France 24, the gender issue is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this fiercely Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "sex theory" from the school textbooks.
The American website, Catholic online, also defined themselves against German law and wrote, "With the world being dragged to a new state of affairs where gender is a matter of choice but not, we turn two more pillars of civilization inside out."
One mother of the newborn from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see the children's sex assigned at birth.
"Parning itself is stressful even without further restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said, speaking to the parental care website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female gender were called hermaphrodites, based on the handsome Greek, who had a double sex.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that gender was something of a blackboard that could be deleted and redrawn again.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis of the operation, saying that sexual affiliation is a complex matter, and doctors may sometimes make the wrong choice because they don't know how, given their gender, children will feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you weren't calling for a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with the ambiguous gender was presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held that gender was pertined.
He created a new concept of "sex affiliation" and argued that the social causes and environmental influences - how parents raised their child - were affected by child genes and hormones, and formed a child regardless of whether he was identified as a man or a woman.
But in a case from 1966, known as "John/Joan," his theory became questionable.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged due to a poorly executed circumcision, to have their child completely castrated, removed his testicles and raised as a girl.
"The media presented this case as a successful conversion case, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he was re-operated to the boy and married a woman.
At 38, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors still use the "this model" to this day.
But in the '90s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared "disgruntled with the result."
It was also the case for Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old Montana writer who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex tramp.
Doctors weren't sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a "satisfying life."
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and brought up as a girl.
At the age of 12, he got female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent to a sculpture of the sheath.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was scary.
I was sterilized after I was born and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a gender disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to make the proper development of his sex tract.
After learning the truth, he turned back into men, taking testosterone doses and having his bust removed,
The surgeries caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the law group Advocates through the choice for choice, based in California, fears that the German law is "calling to be branded and stigma."
"Many activists are concerned that the German law will make it possible to encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose 'uncurious' for the child," she said.
We're afraid he'll encourage the intervention.
We believe it is better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know how the law will end up being, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported the Australian law because she "allows adults to choose to be classified as a third gender."
"The adult should be able to make their own decisions about the legally applicable sex," she said.
German law is about to be awarded at birth.
This is a battle that a small child should not sedate at this point.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest-alongress from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said German law would "give the powers" of both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called androgensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgenic receptors are faulty, Katie's female features have developed.
He's got a vagina, but he doesn't have a uterus and ovaries.
She is now married to 29-year-old Katie and is a children's psychiatric intern as a student at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is barren, he hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some room not to take a hurry to make their decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and change their minds and gives them time to write "men" or "woman."
In this respect, all is well - you raise your child and love it.
You have an amazing child and you rejoice in it.
You don't have to rush into an operation that's irrefutable.
"It brings the opportunity to involve the child in the decision-making and takes away the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child decides which sex they are more attached to – and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was flown to the coast after being found depleted on an oil rig in the Black Sea and released back into the wild.
One chorus was taken by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at the rescue centre before it was treated until it recovered.
The operations centres of Colin Seddon said: "This cribble was probably migrating from northern Europe when it was caught up in the North Sea by a strong wind."
Apparently, he was out of power and sanctuary on the oil rig.
Mr. Seddon added, "He was unable to take off again, so we were contacted for help."
By the time the Crater was released, he was in good shape and well.
Znojmo starts with stadium reconstruction
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders to carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the Municipal Stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Karel Drábek: Uhlířský vrch - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Together with several others, the testament to volcanic activity in Low Jesenik at a recent (corologous point of view).
The last eruptions were still at the start of the Quaternary Mountains.
Viewed from a greater distance, at the top of Uhlířský vrch, the striking whitewashed plastered Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of the Auxiliary, built between 1755 and 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The innkeeper standing next to the church did not be preserved.
Shortly after the church was completed, an alley was planted from four rows of lime trees, about 1 km long.
The cross road on Uhlířský vrch is the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
At the fifteen stops are wooden sculptures made by the local art carver František Nedomlel.
He used various tree species from the area of NízkiHar.
Similarly, the pedestals of rock from the area form an interesting geological exes.
Each stop also features the sponsor's name.
The coalmining hill is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from the radiometric measurements of the age are somewhat different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than Great Roudný (breasty of 3.3 million years old) and older than Venusia volcano (shests 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born in an explosion.
At the time, she cast out a significant amount of volcanic ash, along with fragments of rock from the bedrock, which were fired by firing reddish-brown.
At the end of this phase, lava leaked to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 metres powerful.
The second eruption threw out red, brownish-red and, in places, black tuffs.
Their layer is mighty up to 50 metres and part of it is accessible in the refractor's wall.
In the tuffs, the striking volcanic bombs are up to 1 metre in size. The second eruption was also capped by the lava.
At the end of the activity, the volcano leaked lava, which today forms up to a 50mm-powerful layer of slag-like basalt.
The volcanoes, which alternate between discharging volcanic ashes and lava outlets, are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually made up of layers, they were given the name of the stratovulk.
The original volcanic cone was gradually subject to erosion.
However, it was endangered to the mining of rocks in the quarry on the southern side.
The most intense mining took place here in 1953 to 1962.
Tuffas were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Mining was halted under pressure from experts and the public and thus preserve this unique place.
The problem, however, is the porosity and small coherence of the rocks, which quickly turn to weather, disintegrate and slide down the slope.
The quarry disappears quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-facing slope is the ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
The rehabilitation is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It's nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can reach Uhlířský vrch by the green tourist sign from Bruntál, or from Silesian Kočov.
Automobilists can use unpaid parking lots at the start of the lime alley, where a short nature trail begins.
A drunk doused the house with gasoline: He threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
Tensions were mounting, fear escalating.
The man threatened to burn the house down.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area went to the scene, as did a unit of firefighters from Mladá Boleslav and a unit of the volunteer fire brigade.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene, trying to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man continued to threaten to set the house on fire.
A SWAT team had to enter the house, which neutralized the man and handcuffed him.
The aggressor then ended up for a checkup at the Mladá Boleslav hospital, from where he was taken to an alcohol-fuelled clinic.
Firefighters eventually covered the house with gasoline with a sorbent, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to people, all pets were also rescued from the house.
The police negotiator was not put on by the man, so the commando went to him.
Anger at the verdict handed down over the curriculum of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombing in 2002 responded in a dissent to the verdict passed against the last of the curators to be brought to justice and said that Umar Patek should have been executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for assembling explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
In 15 years, he could be paroled.
This 45-year-old man was found guilty of a mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other counts of terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, even though it could have insisted that the man with the nickname "Demolition man" (the bully) was given the death penalty because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision rekindled the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other plotters nearly a decade ago.
Tearly, she said, Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should be following in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP, Mrs. Corteen said, "He should be put in front of a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I won't see more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when it was 12. October 2002 detonated shortly after 11 p.m. a powerful charge placed in the parked van outside.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier the suicide bomber had detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month and, while being kept alive, he "died" for doctors three times.
Mr. Hughes said Patek should befall the same fate as the three other members of the Jama Islamic terrorist cell responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one.
Keep him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive, there's just to be no reason.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more isn't that much.
Patek was the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He avoided arrests for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where, less than four months later, US forces killed former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek had been in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish a link between the South-East Asian and Al-Qaeda terrorist groups.
"He did not surrender voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he had felt no regret for how much grief he had caused to others.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be later this year, which will include the Bali and Australian ceremonies.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Theatek can still appeal against the judgment.
Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis 22. in February, it will first appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
The cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church right after the Pope and are the ones who vote for the Pope, so that Francis will establish his first group of men to eventually help select his successors.
He is now 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the Pope, the group shrinking to 120 voting cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a gathering of current cardinals known as a consensual standard would be held ahead of the new cardinals' promotion.
"Pope Francis has decided to give his decision to convene the February Consistorium in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said the number of voting cardinals was likely to drop by February.
He said the Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to raise the number of electors to 120, and as many cardinals in excess of the age of 80, as many cardinals as he wants.
The console will be significant next year because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is some orientation towards Europe in Europe and, above all, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Rome's Catholics are in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of the cardinals since Francis appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope has made his own decisions.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that these cardinals would be asked by the Pope for advice.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is an absolute novelty.
Valero said the pope traditionally elevated bishops from large places as cardinals, but Francis is "a complete surprise - so we don't know who he's appointing."
Notified series of Race Series of Land Rovers
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercoms.
The choice is for improved brakes, a service package to provide access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between the races.
Drew Bowler, the technical director at Bowler Motorsport, said, "The racetime participants who come to the Bowler have changed."
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable path to world class races.
We are pleased to offer this trip in cooperation with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that it will prepare the contestants for the harshness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge - it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and test day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Strings of Autumn
The saxophone great and jazz scene legend Wayne Shorter will dot next Wednesday for the 18th edition of the Strings of Autumn Festival.
Shorter will perform in the Grand Hall of the Lantern on 6 November together with his quartet composed of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation of the PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kumžák.
Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra will feature the track Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday this August, Shorter is still full of strength, as evidenced by the fact that the Prague concert at Strings of Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he worked with extends from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
He also met Czech musician Miroslav Vitouš and Viennese-born Jo Zawinel on his musical journey, with whom they gave the direction of the new fusion style in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade.
For the past thirteen years, he has performed in particular with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
A kind of after-party after the festival will still be the club night of Spotlight, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
Alongside the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the Czech audience will be presented with the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronica and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Secret Wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Gulf.
The Israelis demonstrated exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of pronouncements, they sent out planes, hitting the target and returning.
Without lulling in the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole event and are no longer commenting.
The exact opposite of the confused and grandiose, the actions of Obama's unmoved Syrian politics.
And the most satisfying of the attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't be fooled by the media by their claims that a "Syrian base" or "deliveries for Hezbollah" was bombed.
I wrote here recently that while US aid to the secular rebels in the country remains only on the rhetorical plane, Russia is happily continuing to supply arms to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles unloaded at the port of Latakia that was the target of an Israeli raid.
A clear message.
And note, Israel once again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, though it should be the other way around, according to popular online theories.
The U.S. government honored 2 members of the spacing units, probably the Delta force.
It had not yet been noted that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the American consulate in Bengazi.
The heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city is known, I think they were members of the CIA's secret squad, which is made up of former soldiers.
There had been some speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA's elsewhere.
Now it is clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (it's the same one of those, the two SEALs were killed after being hit by a mortar) is rather surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of an American squad in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the Bengazi attack, they volunteered for the hit and, together with five private contractors, shot their way to the CIA compound in Bengazi.
The Obama administration is blamed by the fact that during that attack, the commando was not officially deployed officially and whole, and that it was simply a hesitant to do.
The commando commander, so without orders he will probably release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country has a non-standard, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents, and private contractors is a pretty interesting piece of information.
This is given that until recently, nothing of the sort of such a thing was officially acknowledged, and even now they are talking about only a kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is a good thing that the US is half-hearted to combat terrorism in Libya.
Although to resolve the nationwide situation, it would take a much bigger help.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost rejoiced Iran's air forces for prosecuting American drones.
But little is known how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to be able to discover your drone in the airspace, there's nothing you can do about it.
But if a drone is discovered by Iranians in an international space, the situation is quite different.
And so it was that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in the international space above sea level, when the first sharp deployment of the U.S. F-22 Raptor super-fighter in history occurred.
He flopped under Phantom to visually verify his weaponry without being registered by Phantom on the radar or simply noticing it, and then suddenly appearing to him and inviting the Iranian pilot to return home, he did not obey without a grumbling.
No wonder when the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare to Raptor.
Court blocked order on the procedure for stopping and searching the police department in NY
A federal appeals courtamber on Thursday blocked a court order calling for changes to the program to stop and search the people's search at the New York Police Department and removed the judge from the case.
A second U.S. appeals federal court said Judge Shira Schein's decision would be postponed until the appeal decision filed by the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program to stop and question people.
The city has challenged its conclusions and its amending regulations, including the decision to assign supervision to the police department to help the police department change its procedures and its training programme associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested postponement on Tuesday.
The appeals court said the judge had to be removed from the case because she had come into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judges, by not acting as a judge, as a judge, as requested to avoid the appearance of bias, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements to which she openly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search people.
It has established an independent oversight to oversee the main changes, including reform in training, training and surveillance procedures, and order the launch of a pilot programme to test cameras worn on the body in some areas where people are being stopped at the most common stoppage.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the naming method of preserving the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled to take place sometime after 14 March 2014.
The tactic of stopping and searching people has been criticized by the ranks of civil rights defenders.
In some form, stopping and searching people has been around for a number of decades, but recorded searches under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically risen to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom were among the minorities, wrote the lawsuit that had come up with a group lawsuit.
Supporters of changes to the Permission and Search program by the Police Department in NY argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and influence how these procedures are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morality, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but it will not solve the wider problem of the police force under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand people over the past decade.
The judge noted that she had not ended the practice of stopping and searching the people that was constitutional, but she had reformed the way the police department had put the searches in place in NY.
CDC has issued schools guidelines on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in case of child allergies to food at school.
This is the first set of such directives to be issued by the US government, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States has an allergy to food.
The CDC Center found that the incidence of food allergies in children had risen by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The directives contain information for schools on how the faculty and staff are aware of child food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
Schools are also advised to have adrenaline rush available – the EpiPen automatic injection is most commonly used - to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislators have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more simply.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms occurring in interviews with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child can say, "It's like someone's been in my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue" or "Itching my tongue."
How Tipsport (doesn't)revent personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered a registration on the Tipsport.cz website.
But I didn't finish that afterwards, because there was just someone at the branch who couldn't finish the registration from the internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch, the registration forfeited, then I moved, and as a result, my ID number changed.
When I wanted to finish the registration later, I was told that I couldn't do it because I had a different OP number, the address and that I just couldn't finish it and that I should ask for the data to be deleted and to do a new registration.
So I did that and on 24.10.2013, I wrote in technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database under the applicable data protection law.
At that, a short-lived day, she wrote me a technical support to finish the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where they eventually wrote after the 4th urgacus on October 25 that the personal data had been deleted at my request.
So one would think that he could make the new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I do not understand erased - it is not a personal figure, but in the end they also eliminated this).
So I used a different username and jumped out to me that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how could they have stored something they said they deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When asked how it was possible to write back to me that the personal data had actually been deleted on October 25 and to send an e-mail with the mistake.
I did that (glound around 15pm) and on that today they wrote back to me that I registered on the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that this is why I cannot, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What does it matter that I have been contacting technical support for a week and I'm dealing with them that I still can't.
What about it that if what was true was true (as it is not) that no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, I actually registered in the 1 p.m. on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictitious e-mail and a phone number and, wonder, a page appeared to me that I was sent a link to the e-mail to complete my registration.
But how is that possible if it is not possible to register in the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport binds registration to an email and a phone number and just didn't drop the data as he claims.
So I once again communicated this technical support that they are simply lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they are writing) because what they write is not true.
I documented several screens that the registration problem was already before 31.10. so the "false" registration simply has no effect on this.
Tipsport wrote off a curt sentence for me - I'm sorry, but by the fact that you're back on you, we can't check your claim.
And he stopped the communication.
Respectively, it repeats the same sentence over and over again that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
Nor can they accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the email and so it didn't actually take place.
So if I summarize, Tipsport not only has not deleted the data as he claims, but he is still lying when he says otherwise.
What makes it worse is that it is easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer's side.
Incidentally, after the launch of this matter on my personal blog, things were set in motion a bit and from the Technical Support came an e-mail that the matter was being passed on for examination and I would be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and noting the same mistake).
We are sorry to kill, but we are innocent, the leaders of the Khmer Rouge plead
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Roughem in the Khmer Roughem, and Khieu Samphan is the former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge, which rebuilt on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1979, they lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunishment, disease, torture, torture, and executions of more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population of the time.
This commander of the notorious S-21 prison was given a life prison sentence for Cambodia by the International Criminal Tribunal in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the nation's best interest and unaware of the true extent of the killing.
"It's easy to say that I should have known, understood everything, and thus intervened and corrected the situation," Khieu Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think that I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadres to "take people to have a mistreat or kill them to deny them food or commit genocide."
But he did admit to "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to the all-Kemboji people," he said.
Bin Sivla, 55, who lost eleven relatives to the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP that she could not accept Nuon Chea's apology."
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be exonerated."
"There's no care for the second," she said.
"If he didn't give orders, his subordinates wouldn't kill," she added, noting that the leaders of the Khmer Rouge were "worse than the monsters."
The "foreign minister" of the Khmer Rouge Regime Ieng Sary was also to be in court, but he died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then-Famed Minister of Social Affairs, was founding an incompetent trial in September 2012 for dementia.
The Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998.
A fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
The British entrepreneur has made the first ice cream to shine in the dark - using a jellyfish.
Using the fluorescent properties of this marine animal, Charlie Francis developed a luminous treat.
The idea came up when he read a scholarly treatise on jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically manufacture the protein that causes llenlocking.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer's tongue - increasing the pH level of the protein and then causing it to be radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it responds with the warmth of your mouth, which is why the more you lice, the brighter the brighter.
Charlie, the ice cream company's founding ice cream company, "Lick me I'm delicious," says: "It's an amazing fabric, but when it comes to making, we're at the beginning, so for GBP 200 you get about 2g of this fabric."
The protein we use in the ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice cream starts to shine.
We've tested it over the last few months and seems to be a great idea for Halloween to celebrate because it's causing this fantastic, shining effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellylact is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every hill costs me about £10.
But it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But its next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I really wish I could make an invisible ice cream."
It's basically impossible because of the refractor of light caused by the ice-cream crystal that makes the ice cream, but I'm counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.

Oil price plummets further to $96 per barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high inventories were offset by a report that showed a boost to China's energy-havering manufacturing sector.
The US oil indicator for December deliveries fell 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in European e-commerce trading on the New York trade exchange during the late morning.
The decline was 39 cents on Thursday, and was 5.8 percent short of the month of October.
Rich oil reserves have been weighing on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that US stockpiles have increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, inventories have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, from two reports on Chinese manufacturing, the impetus for more demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after the growth that rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the previous two weak decades.
Brent crude oil crude oil in U.S. Rafes fell 26 cents to 108.58 per barrel on the International Trade Exchange in London.
Martin Doktor on problems with the Sochi Olympics: Communication with the Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth are indicated by a slight smile, and then he exhales only a deep breath: "It's challenging."
Cooperation with the Sochi 2014 Organising Team of the Sochi Olympics is a little more complicated, according to Martin Doktor.
We can forget about what was at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same way," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A number of things work slower and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of the invoices, they are relatively quick, not so much in terms of delivering information about essential things.
Perhaps we have been lecturing from them for three months to deliver to us how the individual villages will be officially designated, so that we can do a whole lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating with this thing.
There's a lot of things they're still communicating.
Is the Olympic Village at least already finished?
But it's not a disastrous condition anymore.
A month ago, we walked around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean they're empty?
Are the floors ready?
Only the basic concrete, that's what the condition was a month ago.
But they still have time.
While there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26th as a vanguard, he will still smell of glue.
And if they're late, what?
President Putin would you think of the military there?
That's probably how it's going to be.
Just so it's not that the Olympic Village = Potemkin Village.
Rather, they are in danger of not making a trip, for example, they will not finish the details.
Maybe they'll have the roads in such a state that we'll have to take our boots from the London Games.
But I believe they'll work it out somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
There are roughly 78 of them now, although depending on the nomination criteria, the figure changes.
Perhaps the figure skaters will probably ride in the trio they went out.
No one has to doubt about speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Still a trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should not go there until January 26th.
What the houses in the Olympic Village will look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves by subway so as not to believe just sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the mission chief do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I am doing a normal agenda in the sense of communication with the Sochi Organising Committee.
Instead of a post-election sirloin, a post-election stew
The October elections brought a bunch of losers rather than the winners.
These are not just parties that have not even made it to the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also previous governing parties (ODS, TOP 09) and, finally, the ČSSD because of its internal split.
Instead of a holiday sirloin, the politicians served us a post-election stew over the weekend.
The jumper of the election was the Andrej Babiš movement, which promised voters to change the political style of governance to date.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party plays into the political (depending on) President Miloš Zeman, regardless of the wishes of the voters, who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported or elected to the House of Commons.
While the president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he has a few more ways to get it back - for example, by selecting a future prime minister.
While the CSSD is moving away from the chances of winning a premiership in my eyes, the businessman Andrej Babiš is closer.
Post-election developments are miles away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing ČSSD government supported by the Communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy is still better news.
Given ANO's vocal opposition to get together with the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely option is still the most likely option for the coalition of the ČSSD, ANO and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies).
Given the split in the CSSD, which has thus become an unreadable and weak parterre in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations may be rather distressing for the CSSD.
The minority ČSSD government composed of the "non-Nazans" at the Castle is unlikely to pass.
Moreover, any government in which the CSSD will participate will be threatened by the unmet ambition of many Social Democrats, which may lead to a further split in the party sooner or later.
So I ask myself: "Are we not conducting the gravity of the next early election?"
Another election would be more of a referendum on the strength of the ANO voter mandate.
The GOP's plans to introduce sectoral taxes, more substantial increases in income taxes, or the building of a state-owned bank have most likely fallen under the table.
The parties of the ČSSD, ANO, KDU-ČSL and Úsít, on the other hand, agree on, for example, to promote entrepreneurship, a sparing fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged people, to reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
Friction surfaces are most common in the view of social policy and the size of the state.
But ANO now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition so far, the ANO, ČSSD, KDU-ČSL, would be leaning rather to the right.
Which, in my view, is a better result in the end than the left-wing tax program for everything that is still moving in the economy.
More recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted an early election.
The reasons were given for corruption, the squandering of money for overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases, and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the election results, it can be concluded that most citizens were comfortable with this state of affairs.
That they didn't really mind and were actually satisfied with the state that was (the steal and debt of this state) were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I can't explain to myself that there were 3,413,497 voters in the election, with 596 357 voters voting for TOP 09 38,4147 voters, in total, the ODS voted for a total of 4,394,028 to support the original governing coalition, which represents 52.16% of all rightful voters.
Which is an absolute majority.
When I add 1,016,829 GOP voters to the aforementioned parties, then with the old order (because all of the above parties were involved in the "harvesting" and the debt of this state), then 64.23% of the right-wing voters actually agreed to this state of affairs.
In fact, this signalled by the majority of voters that they were not in favour of punishing the culprits of the uproarting and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think the members of the GOP who participated in it will work for the proper laws?
Is it even to help us?
Olomouc to open a public ice rink in the historic centre
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas and winter skating markets, Pavel Spálený, said that the preparatory work at the rink started on the 26th. October and from Wednesday, an ice generator is in operation.
The ice layer is already seven centimetres thick and the area will be ready for the first visitors by Friday morning.
The rink has an area of 375 square metres, the stage took up 358 square metres.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two stalls with punch.
"We have extended the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the stalls and almost the entire area of the podium is roofed so that the skaters can comfortably change," he described.
The streets of Olomouc already resemble the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the skating rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square to repair the Lower Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed in the late summer, so the ice sheet could return to its original location.
People could skate for the first time directly in front of City Hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice rink then became an integral part of the city's Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be launched in the Upper Square a month before Christmas Eve.
Scientists have more illuminated how the movements of the tail are related to the dog's mood
Earlier research has shown that joyful dogs wag its tails wag its tails to the right (from the dog's view), while the nervous dogs wave their tails mostly to the left.
But now scientists are saying that other dogs can record and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said, "With men, it is well known that the left and right sides of the brain have different links to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
We tried to observe the same in other species.
He added that, as is the case with humans, dogs are also responsible for left-handed movements of the brain and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information about how dogs respond to the asymmetric wagging of other dogs' tailings, researchers were monitoring the animals that followed films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't be long before we understand why their tail goes to one side, and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, "We have scattered dogs' films about dogs - whether in the natural version or in the form of silhouette - to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the movement of the tail and depict it more to the right or left."
When the animals saw the otherwise insignificant dog moving the tail to the right (from the view of the dog wagging its tail), it remained perfectly at ease.
But when she recorded the tail shoot mostly to the left (again from the point of view of a tail-written dog), their heart rate increased and the animals looked insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think the dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they have to take and that they don't have to watch out for.
He said: "If you meet dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behaviour and movement to the right begets less friendly behaviour, you will respond on the basis of this experience."
Researchers say that the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog conduct expert John Bradshaw, a university lecturer at veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right side was important to the dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they watched the aggressive dog and on the right when they looked at a cheerful dog.
And in another scholarly treatise from Victoria University in Canada, he said, "The dog robot was more likely to be introduced to the dogs when it flogged its tail to the left than to the right, when they were becoming more insecure - quite the opposite of the Italian study."
The difference, he says, can be due to the fact that dogs in these various studios did not transcribe animals in films or dog robots as dogs.
He explained that a study could help on how dogs react to real dogs.
"Although in the case of many different mammals, there are strong evidence that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won't be long before we understand why their tail goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
RBS suspends two foreign currency dealers
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Scotland's Royal Bank (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, another indication that global investigations by the control authorities concerning suspicious monetary market machinations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the competent authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders in question would be the first RBS employees suspended in the context of an outreach response to the LIBOR (London's interbank interest rate" scandal).
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
"Our relentless search is continuing on this matter and we are cooperating fully with FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the event said that RBS had given financial behaviour records of e-mails and quick messages sent from the accounts and to the accounts of the former trader to the financial behavioural.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been released from his current position as European President of Foreign Mute Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European chairman of cash trading in Citi, took a holiday this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former head of currencies at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Neither of these traders was charged with any offense.
Mr Usher's Quick News group included the Barclays and Citigroup bankers, said the people of the event.
UBS said this week that it had taken action against one of its employees, following the Swiss inspection body Finma's announcement that it had investigated suspicious machinations in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority, Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining the claim that these bankers were in league to move the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combed through years-old quick messages and emails to find cases of misdemeanours.
News of the investigations has alarmed traders in the area, which was one of the largest engines for making profit in investment bank closures in previous years, but which was disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the gravity of the situation by claiming that a large and highly liquid foreign currency market is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily foreign currency trading, the liquidity-raising of different trading firms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that "you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The news came the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired from its stock trading department of a trader, which caused a loss of nearly $6 million late last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the relevant authorities and cooperates with their inspection bodies.
"We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved," said Credit Suisse.
He negotiated the government with both Klaus and Špidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babiš.
The People's Party won fourteen deputies in the election, or only a third of the number of Social Democrats or ANO representatives.
But they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In a team that has already begun to argue with the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who debuted the terms of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002, and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrej Babiš have such a matador on their side.
It will probably be reminiscent of the first negotiations this time in 1992, when the ODS was also a whole new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates of how this year's talks will develop.
The driver was fined £1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The motorist was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie (35), from the town of Tiptree in Essex, was spotted in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to accusations that he had been driving carelessly and inattentively.
Seven counts were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to reimburse £90 costs and a £100 premium for the accused.
Sleep: I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have a juyer, lust and enthusiasm
For Prospal, the family has always come first, so he wants to submit to her full submission at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and he'll extend his career, or he'll finally quit hockey.
"I want to play the role of daddy and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Despite the fact that he is a renowned worker who will never cheat anything.
Despite the fact that he always lets his heart out on the ice and can pull his teammates off.
And also despite the fact that he was Columbus's most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," he says firmly.
He may see it, reportedly wanted by the New York Rangers, who failed to make the season, and they have injured two forensic strikers - forwards Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does your arrival at the Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in dwelling on it.
I know there was an article in the New York Post that I should be signed, but that's all.
Nowhere was it added that it had indeed happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not.
Didn't you even get back from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place daily.
That's the idea of getting into a situation where the contract really comes.
When, for example, a player gets injured or someone can't do it and the team doesn't step up.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get that contract.
But in New York, that's the circumstances like this, aren't they?
The injured is Rick Nash with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make the start of the season, so there's some chances, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The second thing, though, is you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't received one yet.
Unfortunately, that is the reality I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, are you in anticipation that something might work out after all?
I've got the expectations since 5. July, when the NHL's free-agent market opened up, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to be reminded of yourself?
I'm going to Tampa to see the kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sunshine and see you again.
Do you have any planned program?
This is due to the fact that I am the father and the husband and that is what it takes to do.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of daddy and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday Vasik has two hockey games, that is a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Wondering you could do this in a full-time quotes?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This, too, can happen.
I tried it out three years ago when I missed 50 fights for knee surgery.
And I enjoyed it very, very much.
Someday it'll get to the stage of it, all the goals, victories and passes won't make up for what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the purpose of life.
Whatever your job is to be.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could have happened to me besides my family.
You've had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
As I am a hockey player, the first place - in addition to the family - is a sporting achievement.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that's what family life is based on.
My children, I mean, sorry, our children - my and my wives - grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we'd love to see them continue this trend.
Because what we're going to tell ourselves, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else entirely.
That's the chance we should offer.
So are you planning on staying in America permanently?
We'll practice it like we'll do.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia in the Czech Republic and around České Budějovice.
And in the winter, back in Tampa or where our steps take us.
That's perfect being warm all the time.
I've been extremely lucky in my life.
You could say I went to meet him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took away a lot of things I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I could choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who crave this one to choose what to do and how they will live.
How long will you have the will toil, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport. That desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have the NHL, that I'm still better than someone else.
But I can't tell how much longer it's going to stay.
It's impossible to plan.
So you could say that this season you'll wait for the way it goes and then decide what to do next?
I'm at the stage where I'm going by the day.
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasies about extraterrestrial life on earth are not themes that the American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would pitch casually.
In the conception of his quartet, which will culminate in the grand hall of the Prague Lucerne in the grand hall of the Strings of Autumn festival on 6th November, everything is related to everything.
The garnishness of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations younger colleagues are supposed to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair, and think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film images.
This principle, however, the newly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-time Grammy winner, a former teammate of Miles Davis and, now, arguably the largest living jazz saxophonist - is not reluctantly to explain.
He doesn't talk much about music, even though his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of eighty, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to be surprised by life.
"Too many people plan everything and then they are disappointed when things develop differently," Shorter says.
Jagr joked: Goal from the breaker?
He got the puck in the defensive zone and was never caught again.
He also converted the leak after a quick forehand loop.
Jaromir Jagr scored like this against Tampa on Wednesday night, then commented on the 119th NHL winning goal on the social networking site Facebook on Thursday night.
"After viewing this video, my agent Petr Svoboda contacted the director of Czech Railways and asked him if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" Jágr wrote at the outset.
They say we're very similar in type.
I guess I'll have to quit my night practice so I don't accelerate any more.
"I'm afraid the Defense Minister could call in afterwards and he'd like to advertise for jets!" he added with the smiley faces.
In addition, New Jersey claimed its second win in a row.
"And most importantly, you've noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrova is working," concluded Jagr.
Brutal murder of senior citizen on Dec. will be re-litigated by regional court
The Regional Court acquitted a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men pleaded not guilty.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the High Court had overturned the regional decision and returned the matter to him for trial.
The reasons behind the judge were declined to comment, saying the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the teenagers ambushed a 79-year-old man in his home.
Senior died a harrowing death.
According to the indictment, the men strangled him, beat him and kicked him all over his body, and also, with a metal object, apparently with a gas pistol, he inflicted about three dozen blows in the head.
The man suffered severe injuries, such as skull fractures, brain swelling or bleeding in the brain, which he succumbed to at the scene.
The teenagers reportedly took about 3,000 crowns from the house and jewellery worth about 14 thousand crowns.
According to the regional court, they were the only, and only, circumstantial evidence against the defendants' scent traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established in the sense of the legal instructions.
The scent of the crime scene and other items coincided with the defendants in more than a dozen cases, but the police initially treated them as factual and not scent trails.
In addition, certain errors were found in the handling of them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was not established without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
The dead senior with a smashed head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
The violent death was not highlighted by the called emergency services doctor.
It was only after a few days that the forensics officers were contacted by Olomouc doctors, who discovered the hallmarks of a violent death during the autopsy.
Police could no longer work with all the traces of the crime scene, which had been cleaned by the relatives.
No DNA was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradišťsko.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was finally confirmed by the Delhi High Court last year.
The man, he said, was the head of an organized group of six teenagers who were responsible for the jewellery store robberies.
The robberies happened in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior citizen in Slopnny.
The younger of the accused of murdering the elderly lives in Uherské Hradiště.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Will Czech Television ever do without signing events?
She entered the era of President Zeman with a legendary ashtray scene, so it is not difficult to listen to the complaints that collect the documents of the castle's entreprenchory's favoritism.
In the past, the traditioned influence of such an Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík was not documented in this way, let alone to sign it.
True, the editors stood up for the leadership.
The cases described, however, do not give an answer to the question of where such a attachment of some journalists to the yeomen is taken away from - whether it is a response to a direct order or, lest we use vulgarism, a typical sign of outrageous empathetic friendliness.
And, assuming general rottenness, one cannot forgive the question of whether other, equally unscrupulous, power interests that have not yet been given to be sought by the change in circumstances in television.
The truth is for those who say that in developed countries, the obvious attempts to intervene politicians to intervene in the broadcast do not take place.
But the truth is also that this does not mean that complaints to public media do not exist there.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticise mainly what they see as the tenderness inherent in them, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have simply not reached this civilisation stage yet and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps it is also in a country that thinks of itself as the most corrupt in the world, black-and-white stories about evil politicians and good journalists are spent more comfortably than more complicated descriptions of a messy situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings comes up against each other.
While crowds of experts were gathering in Cardiff to show off to fight for the Tangue of the Year, it was clear to all that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet attending school and only a few months ago took his first steps, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly trotanged through three rounds to eventually win the grand prize and leave behind 30 protracted adult rivals.
This inseparable pair – with the same height - were praised for their appearance, and in appearance, and style at the annual competition operated by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry, near Cardiff.
He faced the gentlemen and ladies in the elegant hats, tilted his beret to a cheerful angle, and had his two-year-old Toffee paraded around the circuit.
The faenton was praised by the jurors for his natural ability to control the horse, far exceeding his age.
And Toffee got the highest grades for insight and personality.
Fenton got Toffee in March for his third birthday and has been practicing with this Shetland pony on a daily basis ever since.
His mother, Donna (30), said, "Fenton and Toffee are working together brilliantly."
They didn't have high hopes, but they finally left with a gold cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffe, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and complete strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing off her horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded."
He ran across the sand along the length of the arena and, though so small as it looked so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - he loves horses, tractors and a farm and was in charge of two chickens.
Considering the way it started, he'll be back at the Horse of the Year competition again, and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse-treating contest said, "There's only three of the Pentones, but he already knows how to use pets."
They make a great team together.
The judges picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork between the pony and the one who runs it is – and Fenton and Toffe were the best at the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's delighted outfits were also helped, and he really fitted in with him.
Snowden is willing to "co-work" with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a snitch in US intelligence, announced that he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
The letter from Mr Snowden, who was forwarded to the media by the MP in Berlin on Friday, states: "Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as deserters and seeks to criminalise political speeches with difficult lawsuits that do not give room for defence."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that supporting the international community could persuade the United States government to withdraw the criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the United States Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible."
Tensions in the relationship between the US and Germany began to rise when it was claimed that the NSA had tapped in Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who is running a parliamentary panel overseeing the coverage, said that if there was any opportunity to interview Mr Snowden as a witness "without putting himself in danger and that relations with the US would be completely destroyed," should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a picture of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
On their trip to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Sträbele said that according to the former NSA contract lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left one day.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be "failure" there, a member of parliament said.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said he had faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave home.
But he said the world's reaction to his "actual political expression" had given him the courage.
Citizens throughout and senior officials – including those in the United States – assessed the revelation of an unjustifiable system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities, "as far as the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved."
Not to be balked in hatred
Writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, he lived but did not write, publishes the VACLAV KAHUDA (1965) a new novel, The Wit, Darkness, Present.
That it will not be a slim volume is suggested by the number of pages comparable to his most famous work Houština (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another prominent Czech writer of the present - Emil Hakl - confessed.
What did it move that you wrote a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it - not to choke on the hatred.
To see around you all the new and new clones of that human foolish pettiness, the young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavor.
I am not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by helpless lustre, sew-like souls, and vice-vasuraed ideologues who try to sell their "product" with the air of a small saleable whores.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my jubilant friends, weirdos and hidden formations.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from my life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks, and then I read books by the lamp at the evening.
You're talking about feeling frustrated, hate.
Was there a break in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, just like all of us?
The breakthrough came a long time ago, at about the age of ten.
It didn't have a name at the time.
Well, that's what I did to live after.
There's a quiet boy still surprised, in there.
I see more isolated practitioners, each in their tornado of anxieties.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm attending this giant, thousands of years of movement of the life system on this planet - the birth of the elusive future.
That immense, breathtaking complexity of life, when every stone is the direct heir of our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game where the next and next generation of beings are created on the path of trial-error, creating some superhuman, official intelligence in the biliots interactions per second.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as a rolling process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-transport, or rather, the dialogue that is conducted by the right and the left half of the brain, occasionally floats to the surface and is formed in the book.
As periods of peace are laced with quietly sleeping metastases of wars that may wake up one day - so my book is twelve years of silence dressed in words.
I felt the mute avalanche of life grow in my brain, and if I don't do anything, it will one day humble me silently.
It's a set of questions that have been formulated by the brain and placed by the layers that are stored in the darkness "under the surface of consciousness."
Neokortex, a grey cortex, asks older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient ringtone of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, asks the snakes, seeks the answer in the flight of the birds, raises his gaze to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heaven above me.
Finally, the brain asks the world.
Quite often you're a metaphorical ego - could you define it biologically?
The brain keeps in its billions of connections and electrochemical links all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has endured.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, the brain is used in its recognition, cognitive, process, subjected to a constantly changing present, in a relentless effort to try to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are overload disturbances.
By analogy - as if you "fell up" a PC, from a speech emulator and a foreign-language translator program, you would be entangled first in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarches, ended up with a darkly green-glowing Biosu screen, in the basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about - I am talking about a psychospirital crisis.
You mention it often - why do you regularly care about this kind of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the doposc at the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a breakthrough will appear.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He stared into the abyss for so long, until the abyss looked into him."
A pure feeling - that one is lost, if all hopes disappear, mentally "art" and a new quality comes in.
And why do I care personally?
I'll answer the parables.
Once upon a time, one had fallen into the pool and drowned, running for days, months and summons, he was still drowning and reading, and those books had taught him to swim - to live, that is.
He became a "diver."
Perhaps someone's sentence written by me will help someone, as Hrabal's lyrics once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the particular person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it a consciousness, another super ego, but in my opinion it was best characterised by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else-this reader is involved directly in the process of word and phrase formulation."
From an early age he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in a submarine of Captain Nemo, ran around the Shadows in the dark streets.
In the end, in the end, behind all the authors' branches and their messages, is: 'The sun of the clear worlds of others, Hynek Mácha'.
And when the book is out?
Do you care about the reader's opinion?
On the back bounce that gets to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, even after years, they randomly contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are actually "life" or, rather, "worlds."
They are encoded in the characters of the letters, bearing experience, the history of the regions of each language.
Whenever we can bring them to life if we let their sentences flow into the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to old demonic books, we are committing witchcraft.
After the book is published, you - as it are - awaiting a chain of author readings.
I remember you used to like reading.
Will you be happy to get into it again, or do you feel differently years later?
Today, I'd rather just tell.
And what did I find in the process?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic sign - they are unobtrusive, they don't draw attention to themselves too much, they have friendly radiated, you don't feel lonely with them.
I'll give you an example - in the town of Red Kostelec lived (and I hope still lives) a curly-haired bookwritten (it is convenient to be Clush), a cheerful sidekick and a good girl's bull.
In one leech, he presented to me the individual articles of the readers chain of readers of my book Houština.
I stared into their eyes, and then I was shown a romped, read-quidated specimen of my book.
In embarrassment, I put down the just-read sausage and briefly wept in the man.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and tearing drunkenly with emotion.
Then the young blond half-breed couldn't take it, and roared, he sprang headfirst out the window into the snowdrift.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night's countryside and, with the fortunate rabies of the quibble rabies, the aching soul of the countrymen, and the homesickness of the backstre patriots - howled and bragged like the werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is, formally and content, different from the previous ones.
Is it also true of the text, the wind, the darkness, the present?
It's a storytelling.
It's a fairy tale about a land behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
In his novel Suchodol, Ivan Bunin inserts the words of an old Russian fable in the people's healer: At sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujanu.
There's a dog, a gray chest on it.
Horror, horror, secrets.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Perhaps we were devils in hell a long time ago and drew lots - what role we will play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or will you leave it back on a free influx of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar Brezina.
Writing is a marvellous way of dialogue.
Something of the vast and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our wanting from such depth and in such a wide manner that it completely transcends our horizon - and so, with utter commonplace, we act exactly in the terms of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We're biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes a malfunction happens and we give in to compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of different disorders, standing on the ocean coast of the unconscious, and it catches the tides of warm wind in a leaky sack made from a dirty handkerchief.
I have to write to be human.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, it will be necessary to study at least one of Shakespeare's plays, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction from 1914.
The test will also include a "hidden text" to encourage deeper reading;
The combined courses of English literature and language will be cancelled.
As of 2015, students will be required to have a graduation certificate on the language, and they will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Education Ministry should issue a new curriculum tomorrow for English and Mathematics – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other crucial subjects are expected to be changed next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exam's exam, it will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with the new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our test system to regain the trust of society," and that we need to insist that the graduation exam is "more demanding, ambitious and stricter."
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
By way of comparison, schools in Australia devote an average of 143 hours a year to mathematics and about 138 in Singapore.
Although there will be no official request to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that a comprehensive maths exam, coupled with more emphasis on the subject in the scoreboard rankings, is likely to encourage schools to provide extra classes.
The curriculum will focus more on "real world problems," including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: I am not the one with cancer in the CSSD
Ahead of the election, the long-smolling controversial controversy between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava-based ČSSD was in full swing.
It all came to a head when the Mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, went to court over the undemocratic formation of the candidates.
Still, the players in the case did not want to comment too much to damage the party before the election.
But the votes of the electorate are now counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava-based ČSSD called on the Mayor of Ostrava to leave the party on Monday evening and will probably push for him to lose his post as well.
But Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What the disputes are after and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview with the Journal.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The CSSD was certainly counting on a much better result.
Did it hurt her with the fact that things were being settled in the media in the media within the party?
I imagine that a social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it fits the state of the CSSD's now in.
It is a party that has its internal problems, is mentally ill and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of the CSSD?
The ODS has been going through the decline for some time, I think, and unfortunately, things like this are happening in social democracy.
It is the case that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their predicas with the ODS, had moved to the people of the CSSD and had influence over them.
It then has to do with the fact that the Ostrava Municipality's offices are visited by the police and collect computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not only made up of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think of their own good in the first place.
The CSSD is divided into two implacable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Haškovci and Sobotkovci.
But that, too, had been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a harbinger of what is happening in Prague.
The Hashk's wing gradually filled its positions so that it could then, after the election, create a situation that would weaken Sobotka's wing.
One is in a situation in politics where one sometimes has to compromise.
But everyone has some internal boundaries where the compromises can't be made anymore, and that's the case with me.
Originally, I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing within the party, I made a deal with Luboš Zaorálk to try to get on the regional ticket to strengthen Sobotka's wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But Hashk's wing gave it a stop.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Hašek?
Slávek Sobotka, in my view, is a man who always talks primarily about the ČSSD program and, to some extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I confess I have not heard anything like this from the other side.
Michal Hašek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can only start sacking the party chairman.
This is a power struggle, regardless of everything and against the statutes of the party.
In my opinion, what Michal Hašek has now done in Prague, he ended his political career.
How you perceived that the Ostrava-based leadership of the ČSSD did not approve you for the ticket.
Political parties are based on a competition to see who will be positioned as of their members.
The contest should for the most part be based on the program visions and the capabilities of these people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have much ability or vision, but a political party is a lift to the money they would not receive elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start to come to the fore by breaking the rules without scruples, breaking the rules.
They make their practices out of the political parties of the Mafia and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to take into account whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties start to respect the statutes.
That is why, before the election, did you file a motion with the court for a preliminary injunction against the form of the ČSSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current district executive committee of the ČSSD in Ostrava is consolidating its power by the fact that it can abolish the organizations that do not suit it, purposefully establishes new organizations, gradually fires inconvenient party members.
One example is that they wanted to expel Richard Bednarek from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then rescinded the resolution to dismiss him.
This shows that while seeking to uphold the party's statutes through the courts is the last resort, but the only option is the only option at the moment when the other ways and control bodies within the CSSD have ceased to function.
The Ostrava-based ČSSD leadership, headed by MP Adam Rykala, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumír Palyza, is keen on the post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to call me off.
They promise people positions, win votes, and for those votes, they consolidate their power in the party.
Going back to the past, everything that might have happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged to be described as a man who puts money where he doesn't belong.
At the same time, the city bought the property, which is strategically of great value to it.
So how do you see it with your continued presence as Mayor?
The district committee has already invited me and even more people on Monday to consider our stay in the CSSD.
But I think it's like a thief screaming, "Catch a Thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I don't see anyone in Ostrava's social democracy who will initiate and enforce, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many development things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Yet everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don't read it any other way than to get in the way of the others to make their way to the places they want.
Will you still be fighting these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, then political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively run the state if they can't run themselves.
So I'm not thinking of leaving the GOP now, because I think the one who causes cancer in this party isn't me, but these people who are trying to drive me out.
We want to show that Plzeň still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been doing well in the lead recently, Viktoria Plzen's defender or midfielder, František Rajtoral, has a form that earned him a return to the national team after a year.
He is also doing well in shooting, he is buzzing with activity, after a tackle on him in the match in Teplice a penalty kick was ordered.
The Victory reached the final two rounds against Slavia and Teplice after the victory, but in the end they took only one point from these two duels.
František Rajtoral believes his team will break the unpleasant streak in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will beat Jablonec at home," promises František Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match with the Saints, who play offensive football.
Everything is heading towards the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative attracts the fans to the Doosan Arena stands.
Plzeň's last matches have not worked out as they would have liked, but the word of the crisis is rejected by the Victory defender.
That's the way football is, sometimes you're in good form and sometimes worse.
But I would not be talking about the crisis in any way.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," the West Indies defender.
The Victory team will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's played on Friday night, and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Defend academic freedoms, this applies to both Zeman and ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called in open letters from students, educators and the management of secondary schools in several regions to defend academic freedoms for the election campaign conducted by President Miloš Zeman at the schools.
I was seeing more or lesser success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused a lecture by the honorary president of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received remands in the form of not being invited to the celebration of the Czech Republic's national holiday.
Here is a list of representatives of schools who were no longer brave and were allowed to visit Miloš Zeman: Brno University of Technology, Gymnasium Hladnov in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Commercial Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
We are now seeing in Pardubice a continuation of the promotion of policy at universities.
The newly elected ODS MP, the dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, finds it normal.
Professor, this is really not the same as staying as mayor of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to join the GOP's governors, who are simultaneously challenging the office of MP and the governor and, like them, downgrading both professions?
You are telling people that they can manage both of these demanding, left-back functions.
I know, we have the example of Michal Hašek, who even manages several dozen functions at once.
But that's probably not exactly an example of the person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. Štěpánky Fraňková, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post to fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the dean's office is that by the concurring functions you are violating the apolitic nature of the academy of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current tenure in both posts as an advantage for the University.
"But you will be able to help your school without remaining the dean.
I think that a similar view to me and the rector Miroslav Ludwig will have a similar opinion, so will your students.
Consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count it for you in the next election.
And that doesn't have to be long-lasting.
John Kerry admitted: The spying has gone too far!
The United States has occasionally gone "too far" in spying, with the head of US diplomacy, John Kerry, admitting to AFP during a video conference between Washington and London.
But collecting information, according to the minister, was used to avert terrorist attacks.
The AFP's "First Reconciliation," according to AFP, was echoed amid fierce controversy on both shores of the Atlantic because of the scandalous revelations about mass data surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which has also been targeted by America's allies.
"In some cases, I admit, just as the President (Barack Obama) did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he especially defended the previous practice.
The collection of information is necessary, in his view, to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the US, the Madrid bombings in March 2004 or London in July 2005.
"We prevented planes from falling, the buildings exploded and the people were murdered because we were able to be informed about the precipitities in time," Kerry pointed out.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases has gone unreasonably far off."
The American intelligence affair, which reportedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls, erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans had also been tracking the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their outrage, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States to ban or significantly restrict surveillance.
The Royal Commission learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men's (YMCA) Christian Association (YMCA) had been charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Sexual Child Abuse has learned that before the 2011 allegations against child tutor Jonathan Lord of Caringbah were brought, two employees of the Christian Young Men's Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of sexually abusing children.
But it was said before the commission that in its opening statement to the commission, the association said that they had never dealt with the case of sexual abuse of a child in their organisation.
Chief Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one of the employees of the YMCA was charged with offences involving child pornography, and another, when a gym teacher in Caringbah of the YMCA was convicted of sexual harassment of children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, the commission's adviser, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the initial YMCA statement was also inaccurate inaccurate in stating that external audits were being conducted in the YMCA to award the organisation as a leading supporter of children's rights.
Evidence submitted by the panel indicates that the YMCA was alerted to the fact that it received the second lowest of the four possible evaluations in an audit of the Ministry of Education and the Company in August this year.
Mr Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the management had failed from him downwards when he received Lord, without making sure that the staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys he had committed during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a breach of child safety by the Lord.
Members of staff had given evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that Lord had been alone with the children, guarding them privately, leaving them sitting on his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of the children's services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to him about."
The director-general said he did not accept the evidence of staff that they felt uneasy if they were to contact their superiors and report the deeds.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had clouded their judgment, and therefore they did not report the problem.
Mr. Hare said he had given his view to the YMCA board in New South Wales that the "Jonathan Lord's case" for the organization was that the staff had "undered no report" to the staff, and the council agreed to it.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to let the staff sign the confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged, the general manager for the children's service at the YMCA, Liamom Whitley, had taken the decision to have signed.
He said the aim was to avoid disrupting the evidence, but it was "overly zealous" and mismanaged.
Sexual abuse expert Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organisation for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruitment, vetting, working, training and staff management.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
President of the Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New Green to Savings Should Continue
Since 2008, the Czech Construction Industry has been facing a steady decline in the volume of orders and the lack of interest of the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after implementing the measures, save substantial amounts for heating, but also for the chances for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2700 new jobs to the state.
In terms of the state's fiscal policy, the leverage and multiplier effects are significant, it is also one of the most important pro-growth growth-enhancing measures.
The Association of Building Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government's resolution and is asking for the implementation of such steps that would allow the programme to continue to continue so that further calls can be announced within it.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological achievements on airplanes (but they are not allowed to call from their mobile phones)
Airlines passengers will be able to use their electronic devices "from the gateway" - in addition to calling from their mobile phones - to read, gaming, watching movies, and listening to music on the basis of the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
But passengers are not to expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary from airve to airlines, FAA administrator Michael Huerta told a press conference.
Airlines will need to demonstrate to the FAA administration how much their aircraft comply with the new rules and have updated the on-board crew training manuals and the facility storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among the companies that have already handed over the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the expanded use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in its statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the airline's doors are closed.
They can't turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain doesn't give the permit.
Passengers are expected to switch off their devices again when the plane descends to land and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft, which have been modified to enable passengers to use the Wifi at a higher altitude, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Stewards' Association, welcomed the changes.
"Once the new rules are implemented safely - and we work closely with the transport companies on this - it will be a success," Glading said in her statement.
We are, frankly tired of looking like "watchers."
However, surfing the internet, sending emails and sms or downloading data will continue to be banned under 3 kilometres of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to aerial mode.
So there was still no Words with friends, an online scrabble-type game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was, as is well known, was fired from an American Airlines flight because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored because of fears that they might hurt someone if they float around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are determined not by the FAA, but by the US Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, a national security expert at CBS News, said mobile phones continued to be considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from the FCC data that they can cause the jams of broadcasting towers in the air," Rosenker said.
The FAA industry advisory committee set up to investigate the problem proposed last month to allow the government to use the wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been pressured in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, argue that there is no rightful security ground for the ban.
Restrictions are also finding it increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers also forget the obligation to disable or ignore their devices.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the jamming of navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, the technical achievement of the time.
New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than aircraft of previous generations, but are also designed, and approved by the FAA to make it resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, the airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
The plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should be adapted to make use of electronic devices more widely under the new rules, Huertová said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intensive radio broadcasting than in previous generations' devices.
For example, e-readers issue only minimal broadcasts when pages are turned.
But the broadcast is more powerful when the device downloads or sends data.
Among those pushing to loosen restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded the airliner with their Kindle e-readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem emerged.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aeronautical Passenger Association said he believed the interference from these devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only snippet messages from the pilots to support the fact that such devices could cause the cancellation of aerospace systems, and most of these reports were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to disable the device during low-visibility aircraft.
The travel industry group has welcomed these changes and is, in its view, a sensible procedure for the travelling public, which uses the technology to a large extent.
"We are delighted that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with security," said Roger Dow, Executive Director of the American Travel Association.
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said US espionage "has gone too far"
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the US defense stance on his surveillance programs, saying in an unprecedented admission that in some cases espionage "have gone too far."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as a "author" "author" with the "autopic" about the NSA's espionage activities, which arose through the "autopilot" information officer.
The information released sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry, via video-related to the open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the President and I and the others in the government have actually learned about some of the things that have taken to take up inertia, because that option was there, with reference to the Second World War, the difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, on 9/11."
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the border but stressed that no one's rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify it to the people and is already conducting a thorough review to make sure that no one feels that there has been an abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this trial.
But Mr. Kerry insisted that the NSA sought good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, "We are addressing a new world in which people are willing to detonate themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world that is firmly committed to murdering and blowing people up and attacking governments.
And what if you were able to capture and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing down, buildings exploded, and people not executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that US lawmakers were preparing to respond to foreign concerns about alleged American espionage and convinced Europeans that they needed to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week, and that he was worried about their threats to stop their participation in anti-terrorism organizations because they were disillery with the surveillance of the National Security Agency (NSA).
It is really important for the national-security interests of the US that Europe remains in the same boat with us, in view of the joint efforts to combat terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the democratic party and the presiding President of the Senate Subcommittee of Foreign Relations for European Affairs, in an interview from Washington.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their rage over the NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some of America's allies, even though the agency's chief executive said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstandings of metadata collected and shared with the United States by NATO allies,
Other revelations were quoted as saying in documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA had been tracking German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and another as many as 34 world leaders.
National News Director James Clapper defended the Allies' espionage as necessary and said it was a routine matter on both sides.
In the middle of the turmoil, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year and hopes that members of both parties and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to be involved are to be published.
He said the program was still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the aim of the trip was to help to repair relations, he added that "well-intentioned educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to the spy programs they have used for years.
"While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also realise the fact that we are not the only ones doing espionage here," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland as planned this weekend to respond to the animosity sparked by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as American surveillance activities.
For the words 'Mugabe is a limp donkey' no longer in danger of jail, court annulled the law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to be very careful about the talk in public about the 89-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and has been at its forefront since late 1987.
Under section 33 of the Criminal Code, the disrespect of the presidency was punishable by a fine of $100 to one year of imprisonment.
"State representatives should not be keen to blame people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the representatives of the Constitutional Court said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermined freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal the court's decision, the British BBC reported.
The law was loudly opposed by a number of injured Zimbabweans, among them Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in an argument with a police officer in a bar.
In May, an opposition activist who ended up in prison in public with a "listed donkey" with Mugabe's swearing-in.
In August, the prosecutor charged a 26-year-old man for his intention to use a poster with the face of Robert Mugabe as toilet paper.
The court also declared an unconstitutional law restricting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements will later turn out to be false," said Deputy Attorney General Luke Malala.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed the person who discloses the false information to be sentenced to twenty years of prison.
"The existence of the law allowing the criminalisation of someone for false statements has a freezing effect on the right to express themselves freely," Malala added.
Not to mention that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
Small steps away from the country's one-man dictatorship, he came in in 2009, when the agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangiraj to the premiership.
Nevertheless, the country continues to be plagued by the economic crisis and, until 2008, the world's highest inflation, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government therefore abolished the national currency in full.
Today, in Zimbabwe, it is only paid for by currencies of other countries.
The impoverished economy is being driven by Mugabe's ill-considered agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redosted the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with the running of farms.
Young couple outsmarted to live with their parents, new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was given the award to design the house on the plot, which lies on the corner of two streets, with the property itself sloping down a bit.
The request further stated that two generations would live in the house to live together, but each should have its own clearly separate space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house is on the corner of two streets and on a gently sloping plot of land.
The architects therefore decided to place each household in one of the floors of the house.
"In making the design, we respected the family's ties, history, and the memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the building, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their privacy," the designers explain.
The parents' household is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognisable from the outside, as they differ in different finishing facade treatment.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was shaped with boards, the part where the office is, is plastered in white and the remaining elements have remained in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, which makes the interior of the house very intertwined with the exterior.
The parents' household, more specifically the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree that is of great importance to the family.
The intersection of the interior with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which starts in the garden and continues up to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance to the hall and from there climb the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main landmark of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to fall cascadingly through them.
It was by this that the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique to it.
The young couple's household is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room combined.
It is separated from the terrace by a glass wall with a sliding door.

The second floor is composed as one large open space, which passes freely to the terrace, where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office on the top floor itself is conceived in a pure white and black combination.
The staircase is the dominant feature of the interior of the house.
The young couple enter the house through the main entrance, find themselves in the lobby and then climb the stairs upwards.
Fire crews arrived to rescue the lost puppy, which got 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous outcropping in a quarry
The Kokršřiři ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was spotted in a stoneware by a man walking the dog.
Firefighters rappelled down the cliff face to rescue the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by fire crews who came to rescue him after somehow imprisoning himself on a dangerous outcroyer in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days himself until he was extracted from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson (25), and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were in the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After he escaped when he got into a small accident, they frantically searched for their lost dog and posted calls on social networks.
On Wednesday at about 14.15 he saw a sharp-eyed dog-walker stranded Ruby on a curtain in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station hurried to the scene and rappelled down to free Ruby, using a carrier bag for the animals to retrieve the rock.
The technical rescue team's expert commander, Andy Clayton, said: The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall - 15 metres from the top and below.
He didn't flinch like a flip in the rescue -- he was totally frozen.
But he's fine now.
He then got the cookies.
It was a very unusual exit.
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.
The technical rescue team's expert commander, Peter Lau, said, "Ruby was very lucky during his escape."
There was the possibility of him being very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and was fine in addition to exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall of Halifax in West Yorkshire said, "I was afraid to look at the rescue effort."
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was amazing to hold him back in his arms.
The vet said that if he had too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably have fallen.
Firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We're very grateful to them, they've all just been huge.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added, "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
Firefighters were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
The refrigeration tower was burned in the industrial site of ČKD in Prague at night
A large-capacity magazine was on fire in the ČKD industrial site in Prague, apparently a refrigerated tower, according to the fire department.
"Firefighters were already riding out to the fire before 11 p.m. on Thursday, and they were still putting the fire out in the morning," Prague Fire Department spokeswoman Pavlína Adamcová said.
The amount of pollutants in the air in the vicinity, according to the measurements, did not exceed the permitted limits.
The amount of damage and the causes of the fire are as yet unknown.
Approximately five dozen firefighters arrived in the area in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire at a large-capacity reservoir, probably cooling towers," Adamcová said.
"There is no functioning hydrant network in the area, so we are extinguishing by means of a transport line from the trustees," she said.
According to the server tn.cz, the extinguishing was complicated by a malfunctioning network of hydrants, so firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The firefighter's intervention commander issued a second fire alarm.
There are four degrees in total, with the fourth in the most serious situations.
Chemists also rushed to the scene to verify the level of hazardous substances that could have reached the air in the fire.
"However, they did not focus on the air with a number of pollutants that would be above the hygiene standards," the fire department spokesperson said.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmansan health service
The federal government insists that a $325 million rescue package for the moribund health sector in Tasmania contains tough conditions to ensure that the state government does not undermine funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union was taking "accelerated measures" to avert the crisis caused by the island's aging population, a higher number of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided following government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilki.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Ms Plibersecová said today.
The package of $325 million contains $31 million for surgeries at the request of the patient.
A further 2600 operations including orthopedic operations and cataract surgeries will help to remove the indebtedness.
There is also money for free-access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic systems of medical records in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the thoughts that leading clinicians told me to help the Tasmanian health system in the best way," Ms Plibersek said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting and registration rights regime.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive the money of the Australian Union and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State supplies the services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million will be of no use "until a genuine reform is followed to lay down a more sustainable basis for the Tasmanian public health system."
Yet he praised the government for his response to his request for swift aid, which he first made in negotiations with the Prime Minister in early May.
"I believe the federal auxiliary package can free the state's public health service from a critical condition," Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional procedures chosen will significantly overturn recent cuts.
Federal opposition spokesman for the health service, Peter Dutton, believes today's statement is just a "paper."
"The reason for I am here is that the Labour government has taken out $430 million from our health system," he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes back almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union, which is donating $300 million to it, and to pretend it's good news.
Mr. Dutton called on Mrs Pliberseck to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package would be spent on a higher bureaucracy.
On the metro on the Bridge, the music plays
The transport company, hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the Music on the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during the metro operation, is the A Bridge to the exit of Wenceslas Square.
The trial will take six months.
There will probably be police specialists in the ghetto, to ease the tension
In the future, the ghettos in the Czech Republic should be active in the Czech Republic.
They'd spend up to half their errands here.
They would keep an eye on the ground and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from impoverished places and residents from the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Interior Ministry is counting on this.
According to him, the situation in the country would be helped mainly by the "special-jawing provision of social housing."
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were around 300 shantytowns and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living in them, mainly Roma.
Ghetto-ghetto adults were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
She was awe-inspa.
According to experts at the problem sites, meanwhile, the number of people has added a hundred.
Relations between their residents and others are escalating.
In several places there were anti-Romani marches.
The extremists were joined by people from the surrounding area.
According to the Interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in areas with ghettos.
The essential condition, he said, was "the retrospective application of equal access to law enforcement."
But this is said to be impossible to achieve without detailed knowledge of the place and the people.
A specialist would take errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest he would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he would oversee order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better address the problems or offences.
"Thanks to the established confidence, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of infringements," Interior said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive bonuses, at between CZK 500 and CZK 1,000 per month.
The introduction of special police officers to problem areas is to be paid for by Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now roughly $15.5 million).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations have begun this year, and a detailed proposal is being worked out now.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbours.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem with socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements," the authors of the report said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to be given by an analysis to determine the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year for these officers after the end of the project.
According to the project's design, the selected police officers will first undergo an internship in Slovakia.
This training should be attended by five dozen members a year.
They will produce the most suitable candidates.
There should also be a special education for police officers who will be active in the ghettos.
According to the authors, it would mainly help social housing to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration, he says.
According to the Interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be given to social housing that would be comparable to normal housing.
The tenants would have to implement an integration plan to be put together by social workers.
They would have to abide by the accommodation regulations, take care of their health, send children to schools, retraining themselves and actively seek work.
If they tried to integrate, they would be up to a higher standard of housing.
According to the Interior, the impenetrable housing system should operate for at least 30 years until the next generation grows "integrically-motivated environments."
The social housing model is being prepared by local development and labour departments.
They're supposed to propose it by the end of the year.
Together with Barta, the inspection also arrested an analyst of the anti-corruption police
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was reported by the news server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon discovered that the General Inspectorate of Security Forces (GIBS) took charge of the case, its people were to arrest Bárta in the center of Prague.
It took place in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection addresses cases where the accused are police officers, but its authority also applies to civil persons.
According to MF DNES, among those arrested, one of the anti-corruption police officers - the lead analysts and informatics Jan Petržílek - is among those arrested.
He has worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej, however, declined to comment on the information with the implication that the media must turn to GIBS on the matter.
But her inspection spokeswoman Radka Sandorová, too, did not want to say anything about the case, promptly referring to the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this inquiry with regard to the protection of classified information," said the spokesperson of the Prosecutor's Office, Štěpánka Zenklová.
It is also clear from this unspecific response that the event took place, but is in a regime of secrecy that does not allow the speakers to say anything specific.
In a similar situation, Bart's lawyer, Oldřich Chudoba, is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "even on this matter," but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or uphold Bart's arrest.
Some media first speculated that Bart's arrest might be related to former police president Petr Lessy.
He was promoted to the post by Barta, together with former VV chairman Radek John, who was at the head of the Interior Ministry.
The dispute, which sparked over this over the event, even had to be dealt with by then-President Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from on my person.
I wasn't contacted, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about the matter," Lessy told iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
It was officially pushed by Radek John, but the party's real leader was Bárta.
Barta has now run for the Dawn election, with a seat narrowly locking him - by 175 votes.
Dawn's leader, Tomio Okamura, said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vít Bárta was one of the many candidates of many parties on our ticket and, as I said repeatedly before the election, he was not even a member of Tomio Okamura's Dawn of Direct Democracy," Okamura distanced himself from Bárta, who said before the election that he had given Bart a space to run for the Dawn because he helped him solve the problem of the bailiffs.
Vít Bárta found himself in court in 2012 with his former running mate at the VV, Jaroslav Škárka.
Foreigners with visa rights may undergo a "legitimate" test
As the government intends to extend police crackdowns, it is considering a "legitimacy" test for foreign workers with a visa authorisation 457.
The test, if adopted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 from being used to fulfil unqualified jobs, or as a backdoor for the relocation of family and friends to Australia.
When a government debate article was issued today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's rhetoric on foreign workers, saying it might offend Australia's neighbours.
"The challenging 'alienatives at the end of the queue' and 'working first for Australians' are a very unpleasant remnant remnant from the time when the unions demanded a protected labour market,' she told the Australian-Indian Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the white labor force was to be protected - and I would not be surprised if anyone in this region had heard the echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion article discusses the 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he is in talks with officials for people smuggling, implemented five of the recommended changes and the rest is left to consider.
If the criteria of "legitimacy" are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail in detail whether "the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal association with the owner or the relevant person of the sponsor of the business."
After previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man from Sri Lanka seeking asylum has died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on the Christmas Islands as a sailing ship this week.
The man's nine-year-old frightened son traveled to Australia with him, and was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on a boat after his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities and the man rushed to the hospital on the Christmas Eve Islands, where he died.
Israeli military aircraft attacked target in Syria, responsible official says
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, a responsible official for the administration confirmed to Fox News.
This responsible official did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was the target of Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice before this year, Israel carried out an air attack on missile shipments in Syria.
From the villa she moved to a block of flats.
Ivana grew up and spent a better part of her life in an apartment building with a garden and a swimming pool in one of Prague's prettiest villa districts in Ořechovka.
The original owners of the house, however, recovered it in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance package.
Ivana was therefore quickly looking for alternative housing for herself and her then older mother.
From acquaintances she received a tip for apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to a large forest park and the dam excited me on the other side," Ivana recalls of the first impression.
At first I thought it was going to be a makeshift for, like, three years.
"We have lived here for more than thirteen years today and I would not change not just for the gradual reconstruction," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter were then moving from a hundred-dollar apartment to a smaller apartment with a smaller area of 62 m2, and gave out almost all the equipment.
The action was not easy, the items were stored with friends, and the gradual arrangements took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but necessary modifications had to be made, such as painting doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner crashed the core, but the owner was most annoyed by the impractically designed and unnecessarily large hall, and a small bathroom.
The combination of two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to define the individual zones and subdivide the room, which allowed for the new placement of the lights.
The first intervention she had committed to after a few years was the removal of the partition in the living room.
This changed the apartment to the layout to 2 + kk, but got the room in the airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to a partial improvement of the standard was to replace the PVC floor for the laminate one.
With the bathroom, Ivana didn't know what to do.
For years, I took home magazines and looked for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Douděrová.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivana.
Thanks to the bathroom reconstruction, the available hall was also modified.
The architect joined the toilet and bathroom space and replaced the two doors with the opening wings with some slides, saving the space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently wheelchair accessible.
High-quality tiles imitate sandstone, plus a comfortable seat is in the shower, a bidet shower at the toilet.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Douděrová continued.
As part of the show How to Build a Dream, a fast but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, which also involved the architect Martin Čeněk.
In the space, which was created by the combination of two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, residential and sleeping, without helping ourselves with the classic principles of optical division, such as semi-transcripts or Japanese walls.
"This would break the openness and unity of the space as a result," the architect explains.
It was originally possible to separate the sleeping and living areas.
All you had to do was turn the back of two sofas and put a custom-made box on the covers between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and the painting.
On the kitchen and dining area floor, the architect used a high-quality marmoleum, the sliding door brought the sliding door to its pattern wallpaper.
The kitchenette, if necessary, is covered by sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new anti-allergic marmolea floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate: a softer uncluttered surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of alcoves and ceilings from the plasterboard highlighted in the colour is a demonstration of how to work with space in the block of flats.
I left the colours to the architects, I wished it was joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The cassettele of the graphoscrek with a motif of a blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, the books were able to store, among other things, in the space under the windowsills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.
The redesigned interior features a superbly contrast of the new one with the older one, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier as well as with high-quality art objects Ivana has collected her whole life.
The kitchen was the last one.
The cabinets had previously been placed on either side, and the owner felt a little like a tunnel.
The architect took away their number and rescheduling the placement.
Furniture in a simple design is custom-made, with a slightly pearle-like surface softening the white area.
The small space was fitted thanks to the imaginative solution of the washing machine, the dryer and the dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen was revived by the all-glass wall cladding above the worktop.
The unique chart-tock with the digitally printed theme is attractive, plus it is well maintained.
Ivana chose magnolium flowers that remind her of the popular neighborhood she had lived in for years.
Now she seems to be happy here, too.
The original bathroom contained a small bathtub and a sink, and the new owner chose a neutral shade of the cladding.
The large shower has a glass Ronal door.
The task was to make the environment a clear, simple space in which the functions and devices would be in harmony.
We unified the interior in material and colour and attempted to make its elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
"A further condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of objects of daily use," adds Kamila Douděrová.
Minister Holcát resumed the role of Main Sister for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalised, that the nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - the representative to whom they can always turn to if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, the Minister of Health.
I respect the work of the nurses, and I think that the field of nursing desires, that he is also given due attention from the ministry.
The pursuit of this profession requires not only high professional professionalism, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I'm afraid, and with all the responsibility, I'll try to pursue those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilful nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who are not helping us too much with their approach to patients to perform their calling with all their empathy and help us improve the image of the sisters in the public eye," says Alena Šmídová.
The newly appointed Main Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena Šmídová, also said on the occasion of her appointment that she wanted to deal with various aspects of the nurse's job and intended to cooperate with professional associations, professional societies, emerging, other non-medical professions and doctors.
"I don't want to separate the profession of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, with everyone having their own remit and, together with other healthcare professionals, forming a well-matched work team that provides health services to the benefit of the patient."
"I myself encounter a number of problems that occur in the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties, and I intend to be involved in addressing them."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical records.
"I know from my own experience that some of the administrative tasks of the nurse unnecessarily burdens and take away from them the time they could and should devote to patients instead," says Alena Šmídová.
Other areas he intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to co-operate the team and with the management of health service providers, the regulation of competences, as well as employment issues such as respect for the Labour Code or the non-employment of nurses by their insufficient number in a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous complaints, but they are not documented for fear of possible recourse to a specific case where violations could occur.
"Where there is no plaintiff, there is no judge, and so the function of the Main Sister of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee in this case the anonymity of such a complaint and have a specific case examined by the relevant authorities," concludes Alena Šmídová.
Mgr. Alena Šmídová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Health Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Philosophical Faculty of the Charles University in Prague in the study programme Nursing - Pedagogy (she graduated in 1992).
Since 2010, he has served as the head of the Department of Nursing and Other Non-Medicals and the Recognition Recognition at the Department of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
Throughout her professional career, she worked as a bedside nurse in the internal ward, as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She published several scholarly nursing textbooks and articles in specialist journals, devoted to lecturing in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted Denis Diderot's novel, which brings an exceptional film quest and a rendering of the times, but is also more boring than it should be.
It unfolds in the 1860s in France and tells a grim story about Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent by her family to a monastery.
When he rebel, he experiences extremely cruel treatment from the reprehensibly perverted mother of the forehead, and for another becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never descends into lumpy or sensationalism, and that's its problem.
The concurrent character of this story leads to the viewers also experiencing an ordeal-like wearing of a horsehair shirt.
Jana Péťová: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big jump - a jump a few years back, to the memories, to my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash the dishes, vacuum and do your homework.
Although these "duties" were mostly just theories, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was very different - coming from school, throwing the bag in the corner and running out.
Play ball games with the other kids, jump a dummy.
Then, during the series Helena and her boys, embropped with a chain-stop stitch a celebratory tablecloth for her grandmother's birthday.
And only then, after several notifications, to finally wash the dishes, vacuum, to fetch the wood to the tiled stove in the winter, and to do the tasks after dark under the lamp (or to rely on a classmate and write in love with school love instead of tasks).
In the morning, eat homemade strawberry jam (from the real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, the contents of which were not even lying next to the strawels) and to drink it with the tea of the dried herbs that my mother and I were so fond of collecting.
I also remember the magic evenings when the deathly silence in the nursery was when my sister and I recorded the songs from the radio on the cassettes that were loudly filmed in an old tape recorder by my mom.
And then on the pencil, we rewaped the tapes and played the same song over and over and over, our favorite, and toasted with a siphon.
Or we phoned across the table using cans that were tied to each other with string - and while we're on the phone call to be better heard, it was necessary to clean our ears thoroughly, the ear-ears of the ear was a match at the time, the ear-ear heer-off.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live on it so that we didn't miss anything.
We didn't need any of those iPhones, iPads or even mobiles and laptops or designer clothes.
The outfit was a generation to generation, and the best "bottle" in the wardrobe was a bromisled home-made T-shirt with SAVA.
From electronics, the aforementioned cassette-man was enough to us to please, and to the maximum, Walkman, which my sister and I shared with and, incidentally, used only on the train on the school trip anyway.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Kloboučka Hop or Man, Don't Be Mad, or as I said, to go "just out."
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, surely my parents saved for it for a long time, but unfortunately we didn't warm up for a long time.
My younger sister stuffed the strudel in him, said he was so beautifully cheated the tapes, so she tried to see if she could sleep a strudel.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last bite.
Well, this episode is still on his dad's plate, poor, on his dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she stuffed the strudel in the video and thought she would play it and not play it, that's why she still can't bake it.
I remember when we were all able to communicate with each other, to make arrangements without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I, together with my grandmother's granddaughter, we arranged for a holiday with a neighbour's granddaughter, when we would meet again next summer at my grandmother's' house - and that was the case, that's what was true.
We're gathered.
Promise with someone now that you'll see each other in a year's time?!
I also remember the winter when we ran outdoors with the whole village, built snowmen, rode a snowmeter on a snow-covered hill by the church on bags stuffed with hay.
Then the whole family and I had dinner and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I would hear the notorious phrase before each dinner: "Beinghed your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but I'm sure you don't have the bathroom to the tap tied in the lemon net.
After dinner, when my dad "worked" over a beer with Jarda from the village in the garage, my mom and I laid down on the floor, rested our legs against a tiled stove, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackle of wood that was made of the stone.
We were closer - really - not counting how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated - we talked - we didn't write messages daily through various cottages, SMS messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew a lot more about ourselves.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is beautiful to remember, especially if I add these memories by viewing albums where they are neatly glued to the black horns of the in-white black-and-white photos.
And in case I didn't know how old I was then, the back of the photos is always written for a year of taking the picture.
I am looking to see that although the pot-creations didn't suit us very well and, moreover, we had our pants two sizes bigger after the cousin, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd better get back that step forward - to reality.
By 2013, and I'll be waiting to see what the modern age will come up with for, say, one day for my children.
What I do know for sure is that these my memories are now, for the younger adolescent generation, at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they're missing a lot that they won't experience this "pre-monkey" time either.
I wish they did!
They must save, young Czechs know.
But most of them have no idea with what interest
More and more Czechs are putting their money aside.
Still, they do not reach the region's savings champions.
The most money is saved aside by the Austrians, who save an average of €181 a month.
A little more than Czechs, people in Slovakia are also saving.
This is according to a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer group in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of savers was improving, and two-thirds of respondents planned to put more money aside.
While Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking of savers, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little of saving products.
For example, almost every other Serb, according to the survey, saves at home "under the pillow."
Domestically, the number of those who save higher sums per month has risen this year.
As recently as last year, 26 percent of respondents were putting aside a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns of savings each month, up five percent more this year.
However, the average monthly storage fell slightly to CZK 2078 year-on-year.
The biggest hit among savings products is the supplementary pension insurance.
This is favoured by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to appreciate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, with interest in investment funds also falling significantly compared to last year.
Only 16 percent of respondents already use these, compared to almost a quarter of people last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what returns they make on individual products.
Young people under the age of 30 in particular do not know how their money is being remunerated.
Conversely, the earliest awareness of the profitability of their deposited money is the oldest group, with 73 per cent of respondents knowing this among people over the age of 50.
In an international comparison of the Erste group, Czechs lead to online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by the Slovaks and the Austrians with 12 percent detachment.
Australian woman appeals to Thai prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to a 15-day prison in Phuket Island when she falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally 15. In June, the provincial court on the island of Phuket accused of perjury when she told the Thai police that the driver of the taxi, along with two other men who were holding her, attacked her in the early hours of Sunday 10. June.
However, a footage from an industrial television television later revealed that after she had broken up with her Australian boyfriend, she had returned safely to her hotel.
Police from the island of Phuket interviewed Bamford for two days before confessing to making up the story.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security low-security detachment facility in the Phuketi instead of being placed in adult women's prisons.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canbera for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Satan newspaper Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"It's a challenging time, on the most, but we're hoping to be safely back to us as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia say she was spending her holidays in the Krabi recreation area in the south of Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but is said to have been warned that the appeal may lead to court proceedings that will increase her sentence and result in placement in adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to correct the bruised picture for tourists, which may have just been behind the acquittal verdict.
Michal Horáček introduced his new double album, band and three singers
The lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the hall of the Cologne Municipal Social House not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the show Among Us singers Lenka Nova, František Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Matěj Benko.
After the opening intro and acting etuitus about the delayed musician, Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers to the stage, came alone with a candle in his hand, recalling the story of how they last played in Cologne and the theatre and the electric current fell out in the whole city.
"Otherwise in Cologne they produced two types of cards that I came into contact with a lot of," he recalled.
He also recalled the native of President Zeman.
"Perhaps we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka u Bratislava," he quipped about the birthplaces of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horacek, who had not left the stage and, if he had not spoken, sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical feat.
The calendar was also done by Josef Mánes, who put it on the astronomical clock, but about ice hockey he had no idea at the time, how we meet in those squares and chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That's the name of one song from the Czech Calendar, but we won't play it here today," he amused.
Ondra Ruml, however, sang from this record for him a very suitable Sleep in the day, sing at night and accompanied himself to the guitar.
Otherwise, if he didn't sing, he played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band in the composition of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
The three vocalists sang together a little of the ripper To the Sloe of Heat, a seat, which immediately sprung up the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which didn't surprise me in Kmoch's town," responded Michal Horáček afterwards.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, I heard I get offal in the form of František Sgrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with huge applause, Hana Heger was reminded of the song Dad He liked by Lída Baarová as well as with Horáček's explanation of the communist ban and replacement of Baar by the American actress Mae West.
Composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the song Sebastián, Segrado then sang the gorgeous song Prague by music by Jarda Svoboda, a consecutive native and a former Kolíňák.
But it was the end, the applause standing and the addition in the form of an optimistic piece We Live in a wonderful time.
There was another encore for the playlist, but the fans didn't get kicked out.
Almost immediately after the concert, the entire four sat at the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horáček's books and even the cover from the legendary LP and she took a photo with prospective buyers.
Recently, the CEO of CEZ announced that he was postponing the decision to build the 3rd and 4th units of the Temelín power plant until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and the Government's agreement for the Contracts difference of the difference.
With these reasons, the current management of ČEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, the majority shareholder.
But a qualified manager should give the shareholder a recommendation, not hide behind it.
Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave programme
Billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest because of a parental leave programme because his daughters can become pregnant and benefit from it.
The Mining Magowmaker, who is in dispute over the $6 million coal tax credit for the payment, made the claim when he tried to take the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate to play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be in a conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
"He's been in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if either of his daughters were to become pregnant, he would have a direct interest in getting parental leave," Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission, after recounting the vote, officially declared Mr Palmer the winner in the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast district with a gain of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughter Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the polls are closed?
"We must have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details into the computer, vote immediately and get the results at 6:30 p.m.?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to label ballots.
Is it that the results can be erased if someone doesn't like it?
These days and at this time, the use of penguins seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission studied electronic voting options and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said that his policy programme also applied to the airport in the Sunshine Coast area and that he would take his new job "very seriously."
The public office is a public service.
"We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve society at this critical time," he said.
The new Civil Code is being prepared for six companies out of ten
Six out of ten companies have been intensively preparing for the impending effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act since 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the company's surveyed representatives said they did not address the issues related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This is according to a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the upcoming date of effectiveness of the two key codes, it is only now at the last minute that many managers are beginning to realise what a significant impact they can have on their companies' business.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the lavishing of politicians, the business sector has long been in in the dark about whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually take place.
"Now, however, they only have a few weeks left to make the transition to a new right for their companies without complications," commented partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spáčil.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively dealing with the new laws, 26 percent said their firms had already taken all the necessary measures to be ready in time.
Furthermore, 35 per cent of companies on this number are about to take the necessary measures in the near future.
Against this, one in five companies has not yet addressed the recodifications, yet they have a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and are unable to assess the issue.
Only eight per cent of companies admit that the issues associated with the recodification have not yet been addressed.
The most important legal issue related to the new Civil Code is the contracting of new contracts (21 per cent) for the largest number of companies surveyed, followed by a solution to the terms and conditions (16 per cent) and changes to the Land Register and in liability for damage (up 10 percent each).
Contracts will take place one of the most important novelties of the entire recodification, namely the unification of contract modifications only within the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in both the Civil and Commercialodes will lapse, with the result that the contract right should become more transparent for both citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new arrangements will offer many innovations with an emphasis on greater freedom of organizing relationships," said Lukáš Poddaný, attorney at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In the context of the Business Corporations Act, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
This is followed by themes on changes to the convening and conduct of the general meeting (15 per cent) and representing the company (14 per cent).
The new legislation means tightening up the obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially when a company is at risk of bankruptcy or reaches bankruptcy.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the boards of directors and the managers of the companies do not act with the care of a proper treasurer and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they may lose the benefit of the performance of the post for the last two years," Spáčil said.
NSA revelations increase social paranoia of state surveillance
On a peaceful day towards the end of August, a German police helicopter was buzzing at the US Consular Office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the US forward-sunled patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media claim that the BfV Office hoped it would be able to identify the presence of listening antennae, and the event triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence options "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of American companies to strengthen their international competitiveness or increase their profit."
But ever since Edward Snowden, who became an associate of an informant, began to unveil his valuable collection of undercover surveillance by the United States, European governments, and leading businessmen no longer know if to believe the director's words.
After reports that the US National Security Agency was espionage in a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data available to US cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, general paranoia about state-protection has reached new dimensions.
The last straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was perhaps bugged for a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then the potential targets are certainly also leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies more transparent.
I would say that it is possible that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, a company representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey issued in July by the EY consultancy service, German companies believe that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much of a risk as China.
However, throughout the documentation revealed by Mr Snowden, there is no evidence that the United States was handing over the trade secrets of foreign firms to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concerns that the EU lacks some IT and internet capabilities and said it should seek to reduce its US dependence:
Leading entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German Parliament that we should make the German Google.
I just can close my eyes and open them slowly...
That's not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies uncovered by Snowden is still shocking to some companies who have thought that China was the biggest threat to follow surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have more widely realized that the data stored in the US is under the jurisdiction there and therefore potentially countervailable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud security alliance business community, around 10 percent of non-American members canceled plans to use a cloud provider based in the US-based press after the US Prism revelation.
Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs of SAP, says, "Do we have a new question for customers that wasn't here a year ago - where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction?"
Many German senior officials argue that the latest reports are merely confirmation of what they already knew: that the powerful states want to alienate their most precious secrets, and that data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
"This has been a major issue for many years and it has not changed significantly during the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the agrochemical company BASF.
The Americans are doing espionage on us at the commercial and industrial level, just as we do espionage on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders generally don't want to boast of the countermeasures they've made to potentially not give the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free memory USB drive or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi's board member, says it has been a common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
The German BfV advises executives to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
The prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, there is a fear that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and tracking.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leaders of the global market in their specific areas.
"Many and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorised access," the BfV warns in its report.
The US warns its own company against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington, in February, US National Intelligence Estimate documents listed France, alongside Russia and Israel, in the second row of perpetrators involved in the hacking activity for economic correspondents, as soon as China.
A member of the council in a German risk-free society concluded that, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France's internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month, "Services know quite well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are espionage on their allies."
New nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before human trials, you need to run more tests that take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical School in New York says the first signs are good.
"We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong to overcome all current approaches," Professor Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been compiled to carry genetic information to produce anti-inicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to form a smooth stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies chase all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from taking a nicotine hit.
In the tests of the vaccinated mice, which were additionally supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But the mice that weren't vaccinated, "squitted," the researchers said, a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injection had to be administered frequently to maintain sufficient antibody levels, so they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of new vaccines should be much lower as they convert liver cells into antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for people, they could be given to children before they want to try a cigarette, avoiding addiction to nicotine addiction.
But it would be much more likely to be used by smokers to stop.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't have any enjoyment of it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that'll help them get rid of this habit," he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioning that further research is needed.
The desperate cry of Obama's voter
I voted for Obama twice - I shared hope for a possible change
He says Obama's sincere efforts derailed by the Republican Party's obstruction
Obstructive policy cannot excuse the woes of Obama's healthcare website or unmanned aircraft attacks
The Obama campaign's concerred of 2008 is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard.
I'm reading a very sad book these days.
I thought of this book that, in the bleak days of my sophomore year at the medical school, I would be encouraged and restored in me for a shred of hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and these are memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish the patient reviews in the evening and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and the speeches took your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelmingly, and the television coverage made us reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents kept the newspapers they'd found.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
During his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And I'm closing the book here.
Going to the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It is hard to commemorate these optimistic days - they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I threw in my first ballot, there were indeed changes.
It was certainly none of the things I'd imagined.
I accept that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse successes – from the Affordable Care Act to the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the "no question, say nothing" policy after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: immigration reform, among other things, the public's ability to choose health care and close the base in Guantánamo.
But after many situations in which I have defended the Obama administration from colleagues and comrades, I have reached an absolute limit when it comes to the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The Republicans' obstruction cannot explain the approval of the eavesdropping of foreign leaders or the drone raids that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by them that the National Security Agency is collecting data on the private life of Americans, or that it is persecuting those who detect the government's mishandling.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a proper trial, or for limiting public contributions and expenses during the presidential campaigns.
It is impossible to justify the discovery of a report that says the White House's efforts to silence the media are "most aggressive ... from the Nixon administration."
And most recently, they can't even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after the signing of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if such a thing was to be expected.
Whether I should have known at the age of 18 that government power could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected office clearly does not have a predictable course, and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events like the Newton massacre.
However, all the examples I have given above seem to the extent to be the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and uncharted alternative, and it seemed he could not consolidate his policies or position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of the next election, would fulfill the hopes we had once heard of.
Yet a return to 2008 – with Obama's support to fall below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
It makes me remember that series of promises that have faded away.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At the next campaign meeting, he told his staff that he had to get back to speed and remain loyal to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I agree with you.

ŠkoFIN's business and marketing is run by Abraham
His remits include product and marketing and the strengthening of cooperation with business partners.
He replaced Ludek Shantor.
Abrahamek has linked the last 14 years of his professional career to the automotive sector.
He worked at Toyota Motor Czech, subsequently at Fiat ČR, where he was responsible for the brand and dealers Alfa Romeo for seven years.
His last venue was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
ŠkoFIN was created in 1992.
Syria destroyed its means for the production of chemical weapons, says supervisory authority
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition, the Global Chemicals Asset Oversight Committee said on Thursday, while fierce conflicts erupted in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where poisonous substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian activist group said that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
Announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before 1 November,
a term set by this organization, based in The Hague, set for Damascus to destroy or disable the operation of all chemical weapons facilities and machinery for the blending of chemicals to create poison gas and fill ammunition.
Completing this essentially initial phase of destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
But Damascus has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
This country is believed to have about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as the fighting raged in the town of Safira on Thursday, as described by experts as the headquarters of both the chemical weapons and storage plant, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, said, based in Britain.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of casualties through a network of activists in Syria reported that 120 296 people had died on Thursday.
Of these, 61,067 are to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, there are 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad's Armed Forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 militants from Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Among those killed are also to be 2,22, cabinet defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25. July, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
This number has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced a population of about 2 million to leave the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira, many of whom have been associated with Al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The observatory said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific figures.
The fighting has underlined the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in their mission to get rid of Syria's chemical arsenal in the middle of the ongoing civil war, must deal with the narrow deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which is closely cooperating with the UN, said that his team was now "satisfied that it has verified - and monitored the destruction - of Syria's declared crucial equipment for production and translations/confusion."
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned."
Previously this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work while visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit two sites due to safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW reported that these two sites had been "released and ... the Chemical Weapons Programme items it contained have been moved to two other declared sites that have been checked," according to Syria.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira facility was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan to fully destroy its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I bow to the courage and bravery that you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission that this organization has ever had," observers' director Ahmet Uzumc said in his commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the civil war is opposed primarily by Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government, with its security forces, which are full of members of the Alawit sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said there was a powerful explosion on Wednesday inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikiya.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller says pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the director of Gazprom said.
"Today we are witnessing a milestone: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in his statement.
This project is a key element of the European continent's energy security.
The South Stream pipeline should add a diversity to the routes of Russian exports across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia's gas to Europe, adds to the riskiness of conventional routes, say officials.
Miller says that direct links to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, mean that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "always" removed.
As soon as the entire project starts operations in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says the construction is expected to start in other countries in the direction of the flow at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic centimetre of natural gas.
Early puberty: Advanced earlier
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty before their white peers.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is coming
No evidence to result in hormones or other chemicals
Experts say one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an obesity epidemic.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in the health of children and family problems.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start to grow at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Children's Physicians in Orlando this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I've spent a lot of time assuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic hair and armpits and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Over the last forty years, however, there has been only a small shift at an age when the first menstruation takes place.
In the United States, it is now average age of 12.5 years, compared to the age of 12.75, in 1970.
"When breast boobs start to develop, a minimum of two to three years will pass before the first menstruation occurs," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (Time Brief Bum on Girls: The Injury Guide to Match this Common Problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is the time.
Discussions are what activates the actual start of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered to be "prematurely mature."
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be closely monitored by pedigree doctors.
Faster growth may be a reason for the endocrinologist to carry out tests to avoid serious problems such as a tumor or a cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature ageing of bones, which may eventually lead to a halt to growth and stunduality in adulthood.
Recommendations on medications and hormone treatment are dependent on the child's age, development speed, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
The psychosociological aspects are also important.
When it comes to the use of medicines, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that "suppression of puberty can alleviate the behavioral problems of a girl and her feelings that they differ from their peers."
Understandable is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have their periods of their periods.
"They're worried he might become pregnant, or how he's going to handle hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter began to be menstrual at the age of 10.
Although there were indications and we spoke about menstruation, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is not yet a coherent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, environment chemicals or a sexual message in the media.
Boys - like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz advocates the assumption that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9, who combines body fat with the timing of puberty.
Further findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanics tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
The explanations vary.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are already seeing hair in the face and on the crooning at a young age, the trend towards the full flowering of early puberty is not as clear as the girls do.
Other doctors attending the conference of the American Children's Physicians Association (AAP) added additional complexities to the subject.
Acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their paediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the child sooner than you'd like to assume," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child is likely to respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need assurances that even when it is done prematurely, this process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
They face a decisive battle.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for the decisive battle for the mountainous region of Kalamún.
According to the still-refined reports, Israel in Wednesday's raids on two locations in western Syria destroyed the rockets designated by Hezbollah.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of its army.
Its agenda is also to fight Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of weaponry to Hezbollah's hands to Lebanon.
News of Wednesday's Israeli arms raids in western Syria are yet to be clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but was confirmed by U.S. sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snúbar Jabla south of Latakia.
Al-Arabiya news station claims that two warehouses in which the rockets were prepared to be transported to Lebanon were hit.
According to its sources, they were Russian-made missiles of the SA-8.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria has been continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles, and the Syrian Air Force is teaching the members of the Hezbollah armed section to treat missiles.
The SA-8 are outdated missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are mounted on the moving chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, it is easy to hide thanks to its mobility and small size.
They are equipped with radar, but it turns off after the missile is fired, so it is difficult to lock on.
Latakia lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling alaws.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has participated in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community to which the Alaskans belong.
Now, reportedly, the 15,000 fighters are ready to help conquer the army back to Kalamún.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalamún lies between Damascusk and the country's third largest city, Homs.
The battle, according to al-Arabi's source, is in retaliation for the opposition's recent attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite Brigade, Abu Fadla Abbas, in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army this year to win back the city of Kusajr at the Lebanese border.
Many of the rebels from Kusajr left for Kalamún.
In it, he argues that Maliki has a large part in the reconstruction of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly the work of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Sobotka is negotiating for the ČSSD.
Social democracy is crumbling, the people and the grandmothers speak to each other and are preparing a joint approach.
If the Social Democrats get squeezed in within a few weeks, they will sit at the negotiating table with perfectly well-played partners who will put a ready list of demands, including ministerial posts, on the table.
The GOP envoys will then either swallow the sour coalition grapes or give a nod to a fickle minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka first came across after four days of sympathy on the wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to take over the political board and, above all, force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party so far is only him, with the other team members only allowed after a key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (ÚVV).
I apologized to the members of the board and now to the citizens.
You're not supposed to lie, in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," Michal Hašek, said after the meeting of the Social Democrat's inner leadership.
He added that he did not cling to the post of First Vice-President.
"I will make my decision on 10th November at the Central Committee," said Hasek.
The deputy chairman of the ČSSD, Zdeněk Škromach, and the head of the deputy club, Jeroným Tejc, spoke similarly.
He pointed out, however, that he had been elected only two days earlier.
Both MPs then said they would do everything they could to make the 50-member ČSSD club sounding with one voice.
Michal Hašek put the crown on the absurd theatre with the sentence: "I have been a member of the ČSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities."
So another lie on live television.
Or did he forget, in the call to Sobotka's resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team, that the UVVV in August, with 57 percent, decided that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party's candidate for prime minister?
The head of the ČSSD, however, by convening the ÚVVV, made a powerful army of enemies until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of the 1921 members of this body and the media with a bunch of rip-offs and rumors, or to recall the real flaws of Sobotka's political career.
There will be powerfully washing dirty laundry, there will be hints of a dark alliance between the coal baron Zdeněk Bakala and Sobotka's wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential attorney Radek Pokorný will be discussed.
They will be debated in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization ČSSD.
The cheering are the words of the Ostrava Mayor and Sobotka's ally, Petr Kajnar: "I signed Charta 77 so that the country should not be ruled by idiots."
Had the TUVV met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritual sacrifice of their functions.
Traitors sprinkle their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning ČSSD chief will then end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
UN celebrates new goals for fighting poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work promptly on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDG, which will expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
Speaking at the summit overnight, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said it was now time to "get over national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to introduce the general SDGs' sustainable development targets," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development programme.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the sustainable development objectives that build on the success of the MDGs.
Babiš: The government with only Sobotka.
Andrej Babiš is beginning to accept that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one at all.
The president of ANO admitted this in an interview with Právo, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin promised environmental olympics, plan hatches giant secret landfills
Winter sports fans are already cutting the meter by the start of the Sochi Olympic Games, while others are looking at their preparations with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, though not starting until February, is facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to be failing to deliver on the promise that the preparation and hosting of the Games will not in the slightest disturb nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
Indeed, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a bar set very high, with the Canadian Games making the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
But it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to hold "zero waste" games long ago.
AP reporters discovered a giant landfill of building materials in the village of Achishtyr, near Sochi, last week.
Thus, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulating foams was found by environmentalists in August, which was immediately reported.
Russian authorities have been reputed and the landfill has disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters gave a glimpse of a landfill the size of three football pitches.
It is not the only one, several of them have been created in the area of such places, the British newspaper The Times has described.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly that is building a roughly 60-kilometre route between Sochi Airport and a sports resort, is working on the site.
The business, which has already consumed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin's close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railroad resisted having been set up by a landfiller by one of the subcontractors.
But the locals are already desperate.
According to the inhabitants of Achishtur, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village day and night for three months.
According to experts, the waste is at risk of contaminating the local Mzymtu River, other streams, and eventually the Black Sea.
"The water from here contaminates the Soc water springs for the next ten to fifteen years," Vladimir Kimaev of the environmental nonprofit EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem with the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
By way of comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics cost $43 billion.
Last year's games in London cost only 19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays, and concerns about whether there would be enough snow in the end, there were also reports that human rights were not respected at the sports and infrastructure exhibitions.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers will grapple with a new law during the Games that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on the aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian airlines will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landings, regardless of changes to the US to relax the regulations on these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies the space to change their procedures, allowing passengers to read e-books, watch videos or play games during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in "air" mode.
Passengers can already do this during the bulk of the flight, but it annoys many people that they cannot have access to their e-books during take-off and landings.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a great deal of work from US carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment at critical phases of flight were still in force in Australia.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regulating the use of electronic devices on the aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they obtain from the crew.
Virgin, which had already spoken to CASA about the extension of the use of its on-board entertainment system, was in favor of the change but announced that it would submit to the regulator's decision.
"We would welcome the CASA to analyse the permission to use the electronic devices, because we really think that this would improve customers' experiences now (wireless on-air entertainment)," the spokesman said.
Qantas has announced that it will stick to the current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention of changing that anytime soon," he said.
The FAA's regulations apply to American airlines.
But we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory field, which can be useful to our travellers, and we will certainly study the FAA's decisions and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US air carriers, the impact of the regulations will be different from the company to the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio jamming of mobile phones, as well as revising manuals, training material, hand luggage programmes and passenger information.
"Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to disable the device during the landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier devices be safely stored under the seats or in the storage area overhead during take-off and descent.
Nonsense in Gravity is, but the spectacle is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the Space Gravity sold out in the Czech Republic for some time after its premiere.
In October, it was seen by nearly 150,000 viewers, according to the Union of Film Distributors, and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews view the picture positively.
Others, however, find certain inconsistencies.
Lidovky.cz asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films that I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity included, although it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean he's wrong.
I enjoyed it too much.
You can notice, for example, the hair of Sandra Bullock, which somehow does not come in weightlessness.
Hubb's space telescope and the International Space Station move on markedly different orbits of orbit, so they cannot be seen in one frame.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and the whole behaviour of the fire in weightlessness.
The suits, they say, would also not withstand such wounds.
Heroes in Gravity often collide with various objects, and suits can withstand everything without too much difficulty.
Criticism was not spared or the plot plot.
Such a large tragedy in Earth's orbit is unrealistic, according to some of the debaters.
In addition, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to correct the technique.
People are also arguing about the "unreal" behaviour of the ropes on the forums.
It is said to feel as if it were intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Observatory and Planetarium of the City. Prague): I have only seen it on a wide screen so far, but I can clearly say, I have been enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, it was science-fiction.
And for such a story, the author has the right (almost responsibility) not to hold consistently to reality.
"More than the discrepancy you mentioned, I was touched by the fact that a space station with a degrading level of technology (most recently Chinese) is shown three times."
"Act from China, after all, will not be until the end of the decade and will probably look better than it is in the film."
Vladimír Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in not breaking the laws of physics, and so the science-oriented viewer appreciates that the moment of momentum, in the vocabulary of physics, also the view of the Earth from the universe is quite right to preserve, also the view on the Earth from the universe, including the thin skin of the atmosphere and the aurorag flickering on the polar regions.
Irregularities will certainly be found in more detailed examination.
Additionally, for example, I found out, when reading the comments, that the preferred direction of the circulation of various cosmic trash in orbit appears in reverse in some scenes than should actually be the case (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things were adapted by the creators to their needs, but I did not record any fundamental and blatant transgression against logic or natural laws in the film and compared to other films of a similar focus, you can see that the creators took care of the credibility of the events depicted.
From moments that make no sense, it's worth naming the fact that the Hubble Space Teofel is orbiting in an otherwise incantalary orbit than the ISS.
The consequence is a highly different mutual speed and the rescue operation could therefore not actually be done as it was shown in the film.
Then, at the moment of the Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock) department, I didn't notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces the two players to go on at the moment they are no longer moving towards each other.
Bombardier's profit plummeted as a result of a drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release any data on the air test for its new aircraft of the type CSeries, nor did it offer up-to-date information on whether the aircraft would adhere to the ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next September.
After the opening test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase was progressing well.
The results did not meet their estimates, and shares on the Toronto stock market dropped 8 percent.
State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded his rating on Thursday from "higher return" to "performance of the sector," with the expectation that the stock market would experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
"While we mostly expected smaller shipments of aircraft, the profit margin in the field of transport has been significantly disappointed by us," Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the test program proceeds, we believe that Bombardier will acquire new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market's scepticism to the programme to increase.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will fight their way into the lower market area, which are now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was detected in March and the first flight took place in September after a delay of several months.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177 as potential buyers are waiting for the results of a test flight to verify the company's low-consumption claims and savings on the cost of this airliner.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and liabilities from 15 customers and operators.
Managing director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to achieve its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was launched into commercial use.
Leadership officials also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
"The test plane did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that the ground-based exams and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did that.
This will happen throughout the flight schedule.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks and the others shortly after.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating a CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims to have evaluated its plan for commissioning the aircraft and will provide updated information in the coming months.
"This slow pace of flight tests – even though it is in line with Bombardier's internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015," Doerksen said.
From $172 million or 9 cents per share the previous year, Bombardier's net profit fell to USD 147 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter ending September 30.
Adjusted revenue per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters' IBES system, analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered only 45 aircraft to 57 aircraft the year before, compared to the 57 aircraft.
Clean orders fell from 83 planes to 26.
Unfulfilled contracts in the aerial division accounted for 32.9 billion as of 30 September, which is unchanged on 31 December.
"The results in aviation were in line with our projections, but we were disappointed by the low ordering reception and the overall state of the market," Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to USD 2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, said the return in the division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts accounted for 32.6 billion as of September 30, a marginal increase from 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by the problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Leaders said new outlooks would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares in Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google's finance director Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.33.

Mick Jagger claims he definitely didn't leave after the then 18-year-old Katy Perry.
During an interview with the Australian radio show, this pop star said this week that she sang backing vocals for Jagger's song "Old habits die hard" song.
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he came out on it.
She added, "That was a long time ago, and now he's very nice to me."
In a Thursday statement, a representative told Jagger (70) that he categorically denied that he had ever made Katy Perry's proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers (sepings) who appeared on the Rolling Stones' concert tour this year.
Her new album, "Prism," debuted in the first place this week.
Kenya's press outraged by the controversial media law
"This is a frightening message and it is worth asking what will prevent parliament from simply sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper said, deeming the bill as unconstitutional.
"This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is the government's extension hand" and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the Members," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively hands over "full media control" to the government, and Standard reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya "have a harsh blow" and criticize the bill as "strict."
The approval of the bill comes in the middle of a series of measures to strengthen national security immediately after the Islamic shooter's attack at the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The authorities' anger was turned on by the Kenyan media when it aired a security camera footage of the soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looted a luxury goods trade.
The police director responded by summoning two journalists and a head of media official for questioning, but the summons were later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million by Kenyan shillings and individual journalists can be fined up to one million, along with the risk of "assignment on the list" or be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The General Court also has the right to seize the offender's assets if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "there is also one fine enough to dispose of most radio stations."
It is also reported that these measures may have a winding-off impact on what is called Kenya's "live blogosphere."
Politicians know that if they shut up the media, they can do what they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen," wrote the journalist for the Nation Mutuma Mathiu, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of the system of mutual control and rebalancing in public life.
"Leaving it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunt and collect," he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been criticized by the public in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts imposed by the National Wage Agency and to restore their hefty salaries to around 532,000 untaxed shillings per month, ranking among the highest in the world.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble is bursting
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the proceeds of the financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborne, who presented a 7% transfer fee for the 2012 budget for the buildings at a price of over £2 million and the annual fees for buyers who own properties within the company, not as individuals.
The proceeds from the transfer fee for the transfer of real estate in the housing stock in the districts of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which reached £708 million in the tax year 2012/13, exceeds the total total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, and Yorkshire and the Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: ‘Given the increase in the transfer of real estate at high-value homes and the presentation of the related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are little taxed, regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system."
He added that "this move may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy in London, or that the existing owners are reluctant to sell."
Front properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price - in a wealthy strip ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, they saw an increase of a record 11.8% in the past year.
Prices in central London continue to show a steady rise of 5.6% year on year, but were overshadowed by the booming "domestic market" on which, according to a survey by real estate agents Savills, the north (7.4%) and the East (6.5%) were an increase.
Arctic Monkeys postponed Glasgow concert due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys moved up the concert in Glasgow after the main singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
But the disease of lead singer Alexo Turner forced her to move the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys group says: "After the decision to postpone today's appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and, on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must postpone the appearance at the Hydro in Glasgow, scheduled for Friday, 1 November."
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngeal inflammation and, unfortunately, he will not be able to get out."
The performance at the LG arena in Birmingham will thus take place on 20 November and a performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
