What will you do? The CSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the confectionery
The new councilors of the capital from the CSSD will probably have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old-new ODS colleagues in the Prague council and council.
The daily Aktuálně.cz &quot;tested&quot; the members of the new council from the CSSD as they know the notoriously introduced slang that arose at the town hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political cream during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councilors did not understand well-known concepts.
At least he says so.
&quot;Who is Voldemort?&quot;
&quot;Really do not know.&quot;
&quot;I am more of a newcomer to Prague politics,&quot; Lukáš Kaucký, a councilor for culture, responded to a test of the &quot;godfather&#39;s&quot; dictionary.
And although he is a political veteran, councilor Karel Březina reacted similarly.
For example, the term &quot;golf hole&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s the only term you give me that I use sometimes.&quot;
&quot;Otherwise, I don&#39;t generally recognize slang.&quot;
From the glossary, the terms of which were published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, the editors selected six examples, mostly those that are notoriously connected with the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists were to explain the terms &quot;Voldemort&quot;, &quot;the largest golf hole in Prague&quot;, &quot;going to the patisserie&quot;, &quot;bull&#39;s neck&quot;, &quot;betrayal of the capital&quot; and &quot;plating&quot;.
The trio of councilors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head the Prague education system in the future - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
Fifth Councilor Petr Dolínek immediately refused the test.
&quot;I&#39;m not dealing with these things at all, and I&#39;m not going to evaluate how the Civic Democrats are having fun.&quot;
&quot;Now I&#39;m working on how we understand each other in our programs,&quot; he responded.
As has already been said, Councilor Lukáš Kaucký would allegedly not recognize in the headline above that it is an influential businessman and friend of the expressor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
&quot;Voldemort&quot; Kaucký doesn&#39;t tell him anything and the only date he correctly guessed in the exam is &quot;the biggest golf hole in Prague&quot;.
&quot;This is the Blanka tunnel,&quot; says Kaucký, and immediately adds: &quot;But I know that more from the newspapers.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m going to have to pay for a language course,&quot; he jokes.
Not only matador Karel Březina, but also environmental councilor Lukáš Plachý deciphers the golf hole like the Blanka tunnel.
Both Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Lukáš Plachý is also familiar with where to find this character - he suspects the meaning of the term &quot;going to the patisserie&quot;.
&quot;I think that means going to a Prague company,&quot; Plachý is close to deciphering that it is the seat of Janoušek&#39;s companies.
Like Březina, he recalls that he drew knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to test participants, there is no similar well-established dictionary of slang terms.
&quot;I&#39;ve consulted with colleagues, but it looks like we really don&#39;t have anything like that.&quot;
&quot;We rather call ourselves names, sometimes abbreviations and distortions of names are used,&quot; says Petr Hulínský, chairman of the Prague CSSD, whom the party members call Hulda.
&quot;At school they called me Bříza, but I don&#39;t know if my colleagues call me that,&quot; admits Karel Březina&#39;s own nickname.
The daily Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and it works.
Councilor Weinert is for the Děda or less friendly parties Dědek, deputy Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to the frauds in sponsoring the party before the election, is nicknamed &quot;Igráček&quot; by some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing the Social Democrats allow in intra-party speech.
It is said that Hulínský does not like to hear Hulda, but the daily Aktuálně.cz also recorded another nickname of this Prague chairman.
The &quot;Doctor of Baton Law&quot; is said to recall that Petr Hulínský obtained his title of JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of &quot;witches&quot;, it has published a brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso tend to have several commonalities.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they cannot participate in work, for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
The one who &quot;becomes&quot; a witch is sent into isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
&quot;A man rarely catches this fate.&quot;
&quot;Even healthy young women are not relegated because they help with work and give birth to children,&quot; said a nun who cared for more than a hundred women expelled from their ranks in a special home in the West African capital of Burkina Faso.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual &quot;social measure&quot;.
She has published an information booklet that should help reduce the witch hunt.
But the thing has a catch.
&quot;More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,&quot; Die Standard pointed out the disadvantage of written education.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, poured kerosene and set her on fire.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman ignited an oil that is used for ritual anointing.
He allegedly ignited after the group wanted to &quot;expel the evil spirit&quot; from the woman.
The isolation of &quot;witches&quot; is supported by people regardless of their level of education.
Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: &quot;Human soul eaters have always been a danger,&quot; he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to moderate the witch hunt, in the Gambia the president himself took part last year.
&quot;After the death of his aunt, Gambian President Jammi launched a large-scale hunt for witches who were allegedly involved in her death and tried to kill the president himself with the help of black magic.&quot;
&quot;He called on shamans from nearby Guinea, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president&#39;s bodyguards, to forcibly take randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president&#39;s farm in Kanilai,&quot; Amnesty International said in a report.
On the farm, the imprisoned people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
The two prisoners did not survive the stay on the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were eventually released.
Bakal&#39;s tenant: Drowning in the stove, he signed a higher rent
An older stocky man walked out the door of the RPG Byty &quot;uhlobarona&quot; client center of Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
He carried a folder under his arm and new leases in it for three apartments: his, his daughter and his son, who is serving his sentence.
It was deregulation that raised rents for all three.
Instead of 3,500 a month, the son will pay 4,100 crowns for a 2 + 1 apartment in the second category from next year.
&quot;And it&#39;s not hot water there, and petrama must be drowning,&quot; the man points his finger at his son&#39;s new contract, for the signing of which he has a power of attorney.
&quot;But I signed it,&quot; he explains, half angry and half resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new lease conditions as &quot;incorrect and immoral,&quot; advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man just waves his hand over it.
&quot;One says it, the other it,&quot; he frowns.
The Ostrava region is becoming a large laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of flats that have non-market rents in the Czech Republic await.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the &quot;laboratory&quot; in person.
The Havířov RPG waiting room is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full at 9 am on Tuesday.
Right next to the door is a security guard from a security agency with a call device.
&quot;Rent 2011&quot;, a special button on its touch screen lights up.
One tap and a numbered piece of paper comes out of the machine.
You can&#39;t even read &quot;157&quot; and your digit is already beeping on the large display under the waiting room ceiling.
It&#39;s your turn in half a second.
An elderly couple comes to ask about the rent after a while, but the rush in the waiting room obviously does not apply to the new rents at all.
Most people came to solve common problems as usual - requests for repairs, insurance claims and the like.
In the Ostrava region, tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been receiving letters with new leases in their mailboxes since about mid-November.
RPG Apartments in the letters suggests to them to increase the rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new leases was opened at the client center on 18 November.
&quot;It&#39;s been running for over a week, so it&#39;s only in the running-down,&quot; the workers behind the counter answer after a moment&#39;s hesitation as the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal&#39;s former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the election, the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and a native of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek from the CSSD, took him in quite aloud, and even now the local newspaper is full of him.
&quot;Twenty years later, I want a new floor.&quot;
&quot;They didn&#39;t even change the board in the toilet,&quot; the man mentioned at the beginning is relieved.
Most of the time, according to employees, retirees come to see if they will receive a rental discount if they sign in time, as the RPG promises in a special offer.
Half of the discount on the February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign a new contract by 15 December.
However, Havířov&#39;s &quot;deregulation&quot; counter is definitely not overwhelmed by questions.
&quot;Of yesterday&#39;s 360 clients, only about forty to fifty people were here because of the 2011 lease,&quot; the workers estimate behind the counter.
At the same time, the RPG suggests individual contracting on the website and on its bulletin boards where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
&quot;This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure,&quot; RPG warns on its website.
&quot;No one will be judged here,&quot; thinks one of the RPG Apartments flats, and the man on the street in front of the client center partially agrees.
&quot;I have a 13,000 pension and I have five thousand left to eat, I don&#39;t have to judge,&quot; he says.
But then the worker is still uncertain.
&quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot;
&quot;Mr. Zaorálek tells them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting,&quot; he thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
&quot;The current rent still does not even reach the amount necessary for simple maintenance of the housing stock,&quot; reminds Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the neglect of the housing stock blamed on the angry tenant is the main reason for the increase in rents.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest four billion in rents in apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the upholstered seats of the Havířov waiting room so far repeats some information highlighted in red.
&quot;The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% or less applies to 31,200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments.&quot;
&quot;And it will always be a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter per month,&quot; appears on the screen.
Only for 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the rent will increase by 38 percent.
&quot;In these cases, it is an increase from the extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter,&quot; points out RPG.
For 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Apartments promises that deregulation will not drive out rents by leaps and bounds, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see chart) will be returned by the company to the apartments, mainly to heat savings - new windows and insulation.
They should be given priority to people who sign a rent increase agreement.
The kindergarten also belongs to the offices, the architects understood
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect her to hide a mini-kindergarten with everything that goes with it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a pile of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
From October last year, it can be visited by children of Arch.Design employees.
The design-architectural company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings emerged, has been counting on space for its company mini-kindergarten since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
She employs almost 90 people, mostly in the baby boom age, and she cared about the women designers and architects being able to return to work quickly.
Together with the possibility of part-time work, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees within the social program.
Builders thus have the opportunity to combine demanding work with child care.
The mini-kindergarten was invented by the employees of Arch.Design themselves and with the support of the management they managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
The company&#39;s mini-kindergarten is financed from the European Social Fund through the Operational Program Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant financing (subsidies in the amount of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and facilities and provide qualified staff and operations for a period of two years.
After the financial subsidy has been used up (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mini-kindergarten at its own expense for a period of 3 years.
The preparation of the project took one year and Economy Rating significantly helped with the application for the subsidy.
Care is provided by qualified staff, children are cared for all day by a nurse and kindergarten teacher, so children can go to kindergarten without age restrictions, yet most of them are older than 3 years.
Because it is a &quot;mini-kindergarten&quot;, only 5 children can be present at a time, but even more will take turns during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for school desks, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time, and stressful situations with delayed collection of children from kindergartens far from the parents&#39; workplace are eliminated.
Parents use working time more productively.
No wonder a naturally loyal employee-employer relationship is established here.
Arch.Design thus became one of the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and have strengthened personnel marketing through this program.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudí&#39;s interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the backbone of a dinosaur and the balconies are open fish mouths.
Such is the Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Thanks to its organic shapes, the house has earned the nickname House of Bones from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, a façade reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft curves are all typical of Antoni Gaudí&#39;s Art Nouveau.
The facade of the house is played with dreamy lines, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
Detailed observation shows geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the gloss of the colors is further enhanced.
Winding and twisting of shapes equally occurs in interiors.
Wood in the waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, peepholes and moldings.
The Batlló House, located in the Eixample district on the lively 43 shopping street of Passeig de Gràcia, was rebuilt in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí&#39;s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Antoni Gaudí did not design the Casa Batlló apartment building himself.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated with him.
It was on his design board that decorations were created for the representative apartment of the property owner and the use of mosaics on the facade.
Many other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
Working together on the designs of Casa Batlló started Jujol&#39;s successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudí&#39;s Casa Milá and Güell Park, which contains Gaudí&#39;s other works.
Due to its organic shapes, the house earned the nickname &quot;House of Bones&quot; from the locals soon after its completion.
Others began to call it a &quot;yawning house&quot; due to its specific window-opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted on top of the building.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Their forty-five degree inclination may seem bizarre.
In Gaudí&#39;s work, he absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when completed, the city council was terrified by the result and asked for redress.
The councilors were annoyed, for example, that the building also interfered with the pillars in the public sidewalk.
There was never a remedy, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the district&#39;s call, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two top floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social salon and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented by a jewelry store.
The whole six-storey house is intersected by a staircase that leads to the ascent to the roof terrace.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the lounge door, and a larger company can communicate comfortably with each other without retaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new façade, the house with Gaudí&#39;s reconstruction also received an unconventional roof and two extra floors.
Gaudí&#39;s play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which line the inner courtyard, and skylights is also impressive.
The play of two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which absorbs the sun&#39;s rays.
Casa Batlló, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, is well worth a visit.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and magnificent apartment open to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous artist.
They stayed on the tours, as they found it to be a very profitable business, and in addition they expanded the tours to include common and attic spaces, including a roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes have a 20% discount.
The amount significantly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of a house with dragon turrets, you have to quickly make friends with one of the inhabitants of the apartment building and visit him right at home.
How to choose a mattress and slat: women have different requirements than men
Not the ostentatious frame of the bed, but the quality of the lying area, ie the mattress and the slat, give the basis of a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit a particular user.
When choosing, many things decide, from the weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
The type of interior into which the mattress and slatted frame are purchased is also important.
A typical example?
For example, latex mattresses are not suitable for weekend cottages, where they do not heat regularly, because they &quot;heat up&quot; more slowly.
In addition, they tend to weigh significantly more than standard polyurethane mattresses.
At the same time, it is usually necessary to turn them regularly.
If they don&#39;t have a lot of vent channels in the core, and they still lie on a solid board, they retain moisture: Mold could also appear under them.
Habit also decides when choosing.
Anyone who has spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
&quot;Perhaps all the hockey players returning from the NHL have complained to me that they will not sleep here.&quot;
&quot;They needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam for their battered shoulders, heels and hips.&quot;
&quot;Such is also recommended, for example, for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they do not receive well, information&quot; from the joints and skin, &quot;explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
For many hockey players, but also for other customers, years ago, she was looking for mattresses with lazy foam years ago.
&quot;Today it&#39;s fine, Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses.&quot;
You don&#39;t have to be an NHL guy to appreciate lazy foam.
This &quot;miracle&quot; works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you won&#39;t roll over at night like after a hard match.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also acts as a protection against bedsores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is usually about 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, ie a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, such as singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For convenience and a possible visit.
&quot;Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow,&quot; advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, guildmaster of the Guild of Upholsterers and Decorators, who has been dealing with the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years and lectures at vocational schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own slatted frame and mattress, but be careful when shopping to match the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, all you have to do is mount the slats at different heights, but you may not be able to do that with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring frame at least 15, of which at least three centimeters should count on the shaping and loosening layer.
&quot;When touching your hands or landing on a mattress, you definitely must not feel the springs,&quot; warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grate.
Fully upholstered beds, where the mattress and the base are like fused Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are poorly ventilated, their cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And because we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat at night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble one large (and clogged) sieve.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about the life of mattresses up to 25 years, or even lifetime warranties.
But everything has its but.
And that&#39;s why practical advice from dealers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, do not give up the hygiene and washable cover, but rather add a mattress protector that you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress covers with zippers are commonly produced around the entire perimeter today, so after opening we get two parts (very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), Handling with larger types (and with one person) could still resemble a light weight duel in the ring with a heavy.
Do you have a fixed board in bed instead of a grate?
Never!
Maximum for a one-night bed.
However, provide the board (if it does not already have it) with ventilation openings and use a mattress with a spring frame and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (of which Taschenfederkern) and a loosening layer.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-positioning slatted slats with 14 to 18 slats, but slats with a larger number of slats, 28 or more, will always pay off, where the slats are doubled in the lumbar area and their rigidity is possible regulate.
Mattresses with a spring frame do not belong to the positioning slatted frames, because they do not react to positioning.
In addition to setting the stiffness of the slats, you can also treat yourself to a so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of the slats, which allows you to push or even tilt the slat so that the arm of the sleeper &quot;sinks&quot; nicely.
For men who have &quot;shoulders across their backs&quot;, definitely an important thing.
Even mattress manufacturers remember it, who in the &quot;men&#39;s&quot; started using the softening zone in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - they give them a softer surface at the hips.
Aileron or plate gratings with so-called multi-torso suspension are intended for the most demanding customers.
The pressure is distributed to multiple points and the stress is reduced.
However, be careful, once you use the wrong pillow (big and &quot;puffy&quot;) on the right mattress and slat, most of the &quot;plus&quot; will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
A suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, which is preferred, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on your side, the pillow should level (along with the shoulder cradle of the grate or the softened zone in the mattress) the height of the shoulder.
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original grass-filled straw beds.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is simply also for organic mattresses.
Crude oil from which polyurethane foams are made are being replaced by natural oils such as castor oil and soybeans.
Soy is probably used by all well-known producers.
&quot;Organic mattresses mean that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin,&quot; explains Petr Vašíček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first being aloe vera.
But you can also indulge in microcapsules to release the fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While men are &quot;cooled&quot; by the birch plant extract so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, while women are &quot;heated&quot; by the covers.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so it is warmer for the weaker sex.
Today&#39;s favorites?
Mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a broken cell structure, it is more breathable than ordinary polyurethane and also offers better elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams and &quot;lazy&quot; foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels should be.
You will pay for a quality mattress from seven thousand crowns and up.
Those that meet health parameters tend to have a lower VAT rate, they are considered medical devices.
Gumotex was the first in the Czech Republic to achieve this advantage.
Saving on the mattress and grate is not easy.
Sometimes it is possible to use, for example, the actions of manufacturers or retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with Memory foam sewn into the cover for 11,990 crowns.
However, the second one can be purchased for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density was started at a &quot;cosmic&quot; pace by the Tempur material.
It was originally created as material for NASA, because astronauts were exposed to enormous congestion during launches.
Tempur softens in the heat, but strengthens in the cold.
It thus adapts perfectly to the warm human body and optimally distributes its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against bedsores, but also to increase sleeping comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the feet, which lighten the legs and venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents want devices to monitor people, so they want to look after their children
Fear of one&#39;s own child leads more and more people to the idea of babysitting via GPS.
The system, originally created for searching for cars, can also monitor the movement of people, and thus help, for example, in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is still about the size of a matchbox, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
Many people were frightened by the case of the missing Anička and began to look for means to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading their privacy.
&quot;We try to tell everyone that this is not a spy, but another means of reducing the likelihood of a tragedy,&quot; says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
&quot;I admit that in some cases, such devices can be misused, for example, if they are put in the bag by someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case.&quot;
&quot;Mostly customers actually buy it for security reasons,&quot; Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the &quot;box&quot; serves and how it is used in case of emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear anything like this, they will simply get rid of it.
&quot;Even very young children show great creativity in how to intentionally lose some things when they don&#39;t want to be in control.&quot;
&quot;Mobile expectations aroused great expectations among parents, but they can be switched off in the same way as these monitoring devices,&quot; says Bočková.
According to her, it is also questionable whether such a device would really help in the event of an attack.
&quot;As for the impending abduction, the perpetrator will almost always ensure that the child does not have any electronics that could reveal his or her location.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a phone now.&quot;
&quot;As tracking devices begin to expand, they will look for them as well, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising.&quot;
&quot;In that case, the criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,&quot; says the psychologist.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of a sudden pedophile attack.
According to Robert Čech from the company RC Monitoring, which offers monitoring services for both cars and people, even in the event that the attack equipment is immediately destroyed after the attack, its presence can help.
&quot;The device can be set to send the location on a regular basis after a certain time.&quot;
&quot;If he is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available.&quot;
&quot;More expensive devices also have built-in inclinometers, so even if a person just slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately send a warning stating the position,&quot; says Čech.
According to him, a similar service can also be provided by smart mobile phones with navigation, where you only need to upload special software.
The problem with current tracking units is that they are either matchbox-sized pendants or smaller cell phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, this is why a device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
&quot;This will have the biggest advantage that a potential aggressor may not recognize the tracking device at all.&quot;
&quot;Or he won&#39;t know them until after a while, and that may give the police extra time,&quot; he added.
Whether tracking devices evolve into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used to track cars.
It is a combination of GPS positioning (which is used by common car navigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the car.
The army has incendiary cords to wrap around the Czechia. But it will only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of cords that detonate explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of cords to warehouses.
The army has supplies for 225 years.
The problem is that the shelf life of the cords is two, at most four years.
The army bought incendiary cords from the joint-stock company STV Group, as for 40 million crowns.
In justifying the purchase of such a huge number of MF DNES incendiary cords, the General Staff wrote that soldiers would consume 60 kilometers of incendiary a year during training.
However, the calculations of army pyrotechnics, which MF DNES addressed, show that all generals, army commanders, secretaries and cleaners would have to undergo very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick are included.
This is the only way to justify the army&#39;s annual consumption of sixty kilometers of fuses.
This length corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the army&#39;s supplies would last for more than a decade.
If, on the other hand, a maximum of two meters of incendiary cord were enough for the basic training of every new professional, as experts say, the army would secure supplies for the aforementioned 225 years with a fresh purchase - even with increased consumption of engineering or special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently personally complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no small arms ammunition, so that shooting was also limited due to a lack of money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t bother me either that they repeatedly buy so many lighters from us.&quot;
&quot;But it&#39;s their decision, and they know for sure what it&#39;s for.&quot;
&quot;For us, the army is a good customer, which we, as traders, try to satisfy,&quot; says STV Group&#39;s sales manager Jan Děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, Jan Pejšek, justifies the hundreds of kilometers of purchased cord also by the fact that the army will have stocks of this &quot;ammunition&quot; for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from STV Group only talks about the four-year lifespan of the fuse and the police or army pyrotechnics even only about two years.
&quot;With perfect storage, it could be the four of them,&quot; says one of them, who as a soldier does not want to publish the name due to criticism of the army.
At the end of its service life, each ammunition must be carefully tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the soldiers&#39; lives.
However, these tests are not free and cost more money.
Another argument of the ministry is a quantity discount on 445 kilometers of incendiary lines.
&quot;It cost us sixty percent less than last year&#39;s delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers,&quot; said Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense&#39;s buyers.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of firing lines of police pyrotechnics who dispose of ammunition from World War II or here after the Soviet army has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only enough to use this ammunition before it reaches the end of its life.
It has proved its worth for the safety of pyrotechnics, and in addition it can obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords more flexibly.
The Ministry of Defense is already having considerable difficulty in disposing of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the 2,000-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to march on the Rhine.
According to pyrotechnicians, whom MF DNES addressed, the Czech one will face the same problem in a few years: it will liquidate hundreds of kilometers of old lighters, which it buys &quot;cheaply&quot; today.
To this day, I draw on the contacts I gained through the competition
The winning place in the Self-Employed Person of the Year competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year&#39;s Self-Employed Person of the Year competition was 28-year-old businessman Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that Liberec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
He bought a half-demolished house with five flats from savings from foreign brigades and a bank loan.
It was a great courage to be a third-year college student at the time.
&quot;The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation with us at the time did not allow me not to try to do something about it,&quot; says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the first renovated apartment to foreign workers.
He invested all the profit back in the house, which he gradually converted into a guest house with 54 beds.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
Until recently, the most comfortable of these was the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another, just as good quality was added to it.
&quot;We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we sold our franchising concept, and other people interested in franchising Pytloun hotels are applying,&quot; says last year&#39;s number one self-employed person.
&quot;And this victory in the license to operate the hotel was largely due to the victory in the Self-Employed Person of the Year competition,&quot; adds Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory brought him greater acquaintance and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
&quot;People got to know me on the streets, they often congratulated me and I have to say that it was nice,&quot; he recalls.
He definitely recommends participating in the competition to everyone who is trying for something.
It is not even necessary to win, every visibility is good.
He says that to this day he draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not otherwise have made.
&quot;I started trading regularly with some of whom I met thanks to the competition.&quot;
According to him, the fame associated with the success fell on every employee.
And that he has about seventy.
&quot;I see greater loyalty and pride in them for participating in something that has gained widespread recognition.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not just my personal success, it&#39;s the result of the good work of us all together.&quot;
&quot;Only my name is brought to the fore,&quot; Lukáš Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of the victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the winner&#39;s determination, Farmet has worse times behind it.
Last year, the owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žďárský, won the prize for first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in Slovanský dům.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts through which he built a company with a turnover of one hundred million from a small tool workshop in Česká Skalica.
&quot;I can say that the award encouraged not only me, but all my co-workers and increased our confidence for fighting the competition,&quot; says last year&#39;s winner today.
At the beginning of Farmet&#39;s history, there was a desire to do something useful.
So when the state offered Karel Žďárský&#39;s father a small workshop to rent as compensation for property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a couple of friends around his father set up a plastic bathtub company.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eighteen years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company also gained greater awareness among the non-professional public after the success of the competition through the media.
&quot;Not only did our customers start to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they were cooperating with a company that had achieved greater success in its country,&quot; says Karel Žďárský.
However, the past year in Farmet was not only marked by the euphoria of the victory.
The award was based on the company&#39;s financial results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
The crisis culminated, which did not affect citizens so much, but companies were already stopping their investment projects and began to limit purchases of new machinery and technology.
&quot;Of course, this situation did not escape us either.&quot;
&quot;Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to reduce production and there were also redundancies,&quot; explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes be able to take such unpopular measures.
However, they managed the situation and kept the company profitable, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
However, what Farmet did not discount is investment in research and development.
&quot;We built a research and training center with subsidies, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs, we won the main awards in domestic exhibitions,&quot; says Žďárský.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
&quot;I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,&quot; says Karel Žďárský.
A poll that removes meaningless regulations
The survey on the Absurdity of the Year is the fourth part of the business competition.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year&#39;s Absurdity of the Year poll was the obligation to bring to office documents that are also available to officials online.
More than a third of the less than four thousand voters decided it.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, although an official can obtain it with two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the survey, that will change.
&quot;The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the Commercial Register during inspections of premium payers,&quot; said CSSA spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
It is the purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition to shed light on all the regulations and ordinances that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic.
This is the fourth time this part of the business competition organized by Hospodářské noviny and it is becoming more and more popular among the public.
If last year about three thousand voters took part in the vote, this year there were almost four thousand of them.
And no wonder, there are still plenty and plenty of various legal obligations that only serve to delay business.
&quot;For example, we are at the forefront of the number of tax return files in the world,&quot; notes Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Self-Employed Persons of the Czech Republic.
Business simplification has become a proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czechia ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can submit administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition closes.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. The organizer of the competition then selects seven candidates for the &quot;anti-prize&quot; and has the public vote for it during October via the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations that are meaningless, were entered in this year&#39;s survey.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by trade unions and journalists.
Among the &quot;finalists&quot; of the competition were, for example, among the nominees the requirement that cars for the maintenance of motorways and expressways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year&#39;s seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, in which personalities of political and social life regularly take part.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Self-Employed Persons of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Czech Chamber of Commerce, assisted in this culmination of the competition.
&quot;Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws sticks at the feet of entrepreneurs, so my goal is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today unnecessarily complicate business,&quot; said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
The effort to repeal nonsensical regulations does not sound empty.
In 2007, people were most annoyed by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade licensing office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand to an exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trade Licensing Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, which was to report the employment office on behalf of its foreign employee on a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called green card law.
And third of all good.
The absurdity of 2009 was the order for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two foot scales in the surgery.
This was relaxed this year by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator has lapsed.
The new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are evaluated.
A novelty in this year &#39;s fifth year of the Hospodářské noviny competitions is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote sensible and fair business.
&quot;We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and support socially responsible activities,&quot; said Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as in the rebel competition of the year.
Companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal have entered this year&#39;s first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafone Company of the Year 2010 competition.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published in a separate article.
Although the subject of their activity differs diametrically from one another, the common denominators of their efforts can be considered to be support and consideration.
In one case, for example, it concerns people with disabilities and in others, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen national finalists was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice Region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
The paper mill from Poděbrady, which has more than 70 percent of them, takes care of its disabled employees, which is why it was awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and ranked third in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for preferentially purchasing from Czech producers, supporting civic activities in the vicinity and saving the environment.
&quot;We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least possible impact on the environment,&quot; explains executive Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem Region, in turn, thinks about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local sheltered workshop at its corporate events.
&quot;In addition, we support the People in Need Foundation, which specifically helps the local Roma community,&quot; says company representative Ondřej Suchý.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to its employees&#39; supplementary pension insurance in the form of above-standard bonuses.
&quot;In our country, we again make contributions for food, transport, training and recreation,&quot; says Josef Strapáč from the Bruntál construction company Czasch, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically registered in the Responsible Company of the Year category, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly filled in or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
&quot;If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but are not disqualified from the&quot; main &quot;Vodafone Company of the Year competition.&quot;
&quot;Independent registration for this competition alone is not possible, as it is a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year,&quot; explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison &amp; Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police arrested during a public tender
In the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police arrested in recent days.
Želízka detectives deployed to a local media entrepreneur and real estate trader Luboš G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public tender for the settlement of restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would be acquired by a specific applicant.
He had to pay half a million crowns to Luboš G.
&quot;So far, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for the offense of conspiracy in a public contract and in a public tender,&quot; Antonia Zelená, head of the Pilsen Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office, told Práva, adding that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation could not be provided.
The forty-six-year-old businessman was released by police after 24 hours.
Given the minimum of official information, one can only speculate about how he may have influenced the public tender.
A spokeswoman for the Land Fund, Lubomír Černá, said in response to Práva that police had actually arrested the detached workplace in Pilsen during a public tender.
&quot;It was a client, not our employee,&quot; she said.
According to Černá, the public tender has the correct title &quot;Invitation to submit a bid for claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act&quot; and takes place in the event that more eligible applicants show interest in the offered land.
&quot;As part of the summons, these persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared value of the land.&quot;
&quot;According to the offered claims, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims,&quot; the fund spokeswoman explained.
Luboš G. apparently had information about who applied for the call, and since he himself is also an authorized person, as he bought a number of restitution claims, he offered those interested in the land that he would not participate in the competition.
He apparently collected severance pay for this.
That would explain that he had such a large sum of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. has had above-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He figured in the case of former PF boss Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing land in alternative restitution, on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was then that Luboš G. acquired from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the access road to the Borská pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later, he very conveniently exchanged them with the municipality for a house in the historic center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to accept this, because otherwise it would endanger the building by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds more per month for housing
From January, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewage, heat supplies and, in some cases, rents will increase.
From January, families will have to withdraw up to hundreds of crowns more per month from their wallets than now.
Electricity will increase in price by up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, in some cities you will have to pay extra for a water supply in some cities, and in many cases the supply of central heat will also become more expensive.
The rise in electricity prices should cost households a hundred hundred crowns more annually than now.
At the same time, all major suppliers have reduced the prices of power electricity, so a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics, is to blame.
Gas is slightly more expensive, but at a time when people are heating the most and thus have the highest consumption.
So they also have to count on hundreds of extra crowns a year.
While electricity and gas will rise in price throughout the country, changes in central heating prices vary from place to place.
Price increases are mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 crowns more per month for central heating from January, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 crowns a year.
The inhabitants of Prague, on the other hand, are at risk of increasing the price of water and sewage charges by more than 9 percent, in the event that the city increases rents from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, Roasted will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lower in the national comparison.
In the north of Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewerage prices have risen by 7.4 percent.
For example, the price of rent in 450 thousand rental flats, where regulation ends since January, may rise significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, intends to increase rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new amount of rent, the company intends to take to court.
Regulated rents paid by people in about 300,000 apartments could rise by as much as ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally also a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks after which drunks, who were less than fifteen years old, most often end up in the care of doctors.
The exception is not children who are repeatedly treated from monkeys in the hospital.
This follows from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases on the income of children&#39;s wards of hospitals.
&quot;Some beers or wines are completely out of fashion because it takes a long time to get drunk.&quot;
&quot;The trend is definitely hard alcohol,&quot; Luděk Pelikán, head of the children&#39;s ward of the Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia, told Práva.
&quot;If Dad manages to pull the bottle out of the cupboard, it&#39;s whiskey, for example, but fernet and vodka predominate.&quot;
&quot;Vodka has the advantage that they pour it into the juice and you can&#39;t smell that much from them,&quot; the headmaster explained.
And Eva Jurinová, a spokeswoman for the Motol University Hospital, also agrees with him.
&quot;Most often it&#39;s fernet or rum.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s modern alcohol today, especially in elementary schools.&quot;
&quot;In some cases, it was plum brandy that they brought from home,&quot; said Jurinová.
According to the primary Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers on hospital admission are a relatively common phenomenon.
Before Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years at pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances are tied to abusive schoolchildren from a wide area.
&quot;One girl has been with us about four times.&quot;
&quot;She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with an extra 3.5 per mille of alcohol in combination with ecstasy,&quot; the doctor described a particularly serious case.
&quot;She was at a show in Holešovice for a dance party.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s interesting that her mother didn&#39;t find it strange that she didn&#39;t know about her daughter for 48 hours,&quot; the mayor wondered.
It is the lack of interest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered to be the main cause of growing child drunkenness.
However, according to experts, it is not possible to talk about addiction in the true sense of the word among children.
&quot;The term alcoholic means several years of chronic alcohol dependence with all the phenomena that belong to it, and this is not the case for children.&quot;
&quot;Those who use alcohol repeatedly tend to have a rather unfortunate family-social background,&quot; explained Mayor Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurin, about forty drunk children were hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol by mid-November this year.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will be included in the statistics.
Child drunks who are taken away by their parents after outpatient treatment, or taken home by the police, do not count.
According to Pelikán, in addition to the cases where children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of brandy, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied on: the witch, New Year&#39;s Eve and the end of the school year.
&quot;They either drink the grief of a bad report card or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays.&quot;
&quot;However, I also experienced seven child drunks at once on witches,&quot; Pelikán said.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage over who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency drive away flooding infusions with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
&quot;They&#39;re actually better off because they have a good wake-up after that beautiful evening experience and nothing hurts.&quot;
&quot;They are just confused about where they are,&quot; Pelikán admitted, adding that sometimes it spoils the patient&#39;s mood, at least by listing the costs of their treatment.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
&quot;Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I calculated directly for those children on a visit how much their drunkenness cost and that they could also spend the whole summer on a brigade to earn money for that one party,&quot; Pelikán added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies do not resort to regression proceedings in which they would recover the costs of treatment from their parents in the case of drunken children.
For the first time, two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to Seville, Spain, on Tuesday, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for exercises or demonstration years.
These are two-seater versions of the L-159T1, which were previously operated by the Czech Army and which were airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
So far, they are preserved in Aero Vodochody and the trade intermediary - the Omnipol company - took them over last week.
According to Jan Pejšek, it is not yet known when the aircraft will physically depart from Vodochod.
&quot;The single-seater L-159 aircraft for the shift were set aside from long-term stored aircraft, without further deposits or investments by the Ministry.&quot;
&quot;The two-seater L-159T1s were replaced in their current condition and form,&quot; Pejšek told Práva.
He added that the army will not be left without two-seater aircraft, because in May 2009 the ministry signed a contract with Aer Vodochody worth 200 million crowns for the conversion of four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seater machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to enforcing the aircraft in the armament of some alliance country.
&quot;The agreement clearly states that the L-159 aircraft is purchased by EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries.&quot;
&quot;Therefore, it is up to the customer how he will implement this thing,&quot; Pejšek said.
Hospodářské noviny stated some time ago that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of another three aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not announce a tender for the purchase and contacted EADS directly.
The then leadership of the defense argued that the exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has bought 72 machines from Aero and uses only 24, and would like to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have a court settlement.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defense in a European court because it had to select the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by contacting one manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which should arrive at Prague&#39;s Kbely Airport within a fortnight.
A longer index finger than a ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than a ring finger are at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British Cancer Magazine.
This may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
&quot;Our results show that relative finger length can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60,&quot; said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors, such as family health burden, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and over 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had their index finger on their right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to have prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, in the case of those who had their index fingers longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, for men under the age of 60, the decline was as much as 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers - formed during the prenatal period - seems to reflect the different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone supports growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he was briefly aware of this study, but it did not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer was &quot;completely proven&quot;.
The Czechia is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czechia, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
There is mostly snow on the roads and sidewalks, road workers in many places drove all night.
The D5 motorway between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov is closed in the morning due to several truck and passenger car accidents, and the D1 near Brno also stands in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (ÚAMK) told the news.
A truck crashed there at the 91st kilometer, two trucks collided at the 93rd kilometer, and the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should drive just past Brno at the 190th kilometer or drive through Brno and then drive at the 182nd kilometer in Kývalka.
A column of several kilometers is formed there.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right at the arrival in Prague.
There is a few centimeters of snow in Prague, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are formed, for example, in Prosek, Štěrboholská is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run with a delay, for example, on the line between Charles Square and Peace Square.
The Prague Crisis Staff is to meet again at eight in the morning.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
Czech Railways has already had to cancel seven express trains due to snow.
For example, the line from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. on Wednesday until five in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are already passable, but only with increased caution.
In the Vyškov region there are three impassable roads, in the Brno region there are snow tongues and in the Blansko region snow chains are necessary to overcome some roads in the higher places.
The Vyškov region was one of the most affected places.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Cutters will need to be fitted to extend them.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be cleared.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are maintained there due to nature protection only by an inert sprinkling, there is a layer of snow up to five centimeters, ČTK reported.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most falling in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
About 15 centimeters of snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
The snowfall in the Czech Republic is gradually ceasing.
US troops have new &quot;smart weapon&quot;
The US military has deployed a new &quot;smart&quot; weapon in Afghanistan, known only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the Taliban and &quot;change the game&quot; in their favor.
The new weapon is like a small super-precision cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special 25 mm rounds, developed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, actually work like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed to explode not only when hitting a target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
He is usually not protected from above, and if a murderous rain of shrapnel falls on him, it can take him out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use &quot;smart&quot; technology.
&quot;Basically, a soldier treats her by finding a target, sending a laser beam to him, which determines the distance, so he gets a specified aiming point, adjusts the elevation according to it and presses the tap.&quot;
&quot;Let&#39;s say you measured 543 meters.&quot;
&quot;When you press the trigger, the weapon charges and fires at 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters,&quot; Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu will relocate its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the current office building on Marienbader-Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese concern Fujitsu will move its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As a giant in the field specializing in computers and their maintenance said on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move their jobs from the existing office building on Marienbader-Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in the part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to a Fujist spokesman, another 100 of the group&#39;s jobs, which are currently distributed in the region, should move there in the near future.
The rental offer was said to be very attractive and the large offices in Astro Park are said to be more suitable for the working methods of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
Competent CEO Bernd Wagner said, &quot;In Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure.&quot;
Excellent connections to the airport are very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region caused joy at the winners yesterday and disappointment at the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), the chief economic officer in Frankfurt, said that this had succeeded in gaining a &quot;global player&quot;.
It is said to be a &quot;fantastic expression of trust in this location&quot;.
Fujitsu is said to be suitable for the city, settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu&#39;s decision.
The city was reportedly informed in time by the company&#39;s management about its intention.
&quot;Of course we offered our help to the company,&quot; Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the troubles of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader-Square.
As a result, economic reasons were decisive.
Now the point is to prevent a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
&quot;I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative.&quot;
The house on Rathaus-Square, which Fujitsu has used so far, and the neighboring &quot;Kleine Vertikale&quot; were among the most discussed construction plans of the spa town ten years ago, together with other buildings on Marienbader-Square.
Between the station and the town hall, the so-called urban entree was created as a joint project of the city and a private designer, which was criticized both for the massive development of areas that previously served as parking lots and also for the height of buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, a manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, moved into the house, as did the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still associated with Siemens at the time.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and a year later they were sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu Group from Tokyo is known as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers companies computers and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine and Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but most Fujitsu employees are in Munich.
A subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
The Astro Park office building has rented 7,000 square meters for this purpose.
In the complex - its name points to the star floor plan, which is twenty years old, it houses, among others, the central union of the electrical and electronics industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
Wikileaks is getting into trouble.
Amazon has turned off the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened under political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly based in the UK.
Wikileaks, a detection platform, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their existing home server in America and are now searching for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol&#39;s search list, is due to stay in a UK newspaper.
&quot;Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon.&quot;
&quot;Free speech in the land of the free,&quot; activists said on Twitter (Wednesday).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic traps to handle the high number of accesses to documents.
Using Twitter, Wikileaks explained: &quot;Okay - we&#39;re going to spend our dollars now by hiring people in Europe.&quot;
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, &quot;then they should stop selling books.&quot;
Amazon has stopped using its Wikileaks servers after Senator Joe Lieberman&#39;s collaborators allegedly conducted a search, CNN reported based on information from Lieberman&#39;s office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Defense threatened to boycott Amazon, the British &quot;Guardian&quot; informed.
&quot;I used to wish Amazon had taken this step earlier, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks,&quot; the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, has called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries.
&quot;Wikileaks is acting illegally, outrageously and ruthlessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life on the planet,&quot; a non-party senator said in a statement.
&quot;No responsible company - either American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in their efforts to spread stolen material.&quot;
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol&#39;s wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot;, the 39-year-old Australian is staying in Great Britain, and Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
An internet activist has always called investigations in Sweden the intrigues of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were also threats.
&quot;There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange.&quot;
That&#39;s why Assange is rightly afraid for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
That&#39;s why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently reacted to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, one adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on television - apparently ironically, Assange should be &quot;murdered&quot; and Obama could use a &quot;target plane&quot;.
Meanwhile, a verbal skirmish broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama&#39;s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it &quot;ridiculous and absurd&quot; that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently announced espionage calls for diplomats.
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure why we care about one person&#39;s opinion with a website,&quot; Gibbs said.
&quot;Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website.&quot;
The US government is now extensively researching the security of its databases.
Russell Travers, deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism Measures, was appointed special commissioner, the White House said.
Travers became responsible for developing the &quot;necessary structural reforms&quot; needed following the publication of embassy reports on Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are to be put in danger due to publication on Wikileaks.
&quot;We have done everything we can to get in touch with them,&quot; said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
&quot;We are ready to protect them if necessary.&quot;
Ice Cream University
At the &quot;Gelato University&quot; near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
There is great interest in the basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream actually come from?
Z Gelatiere az Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a Czech somewhat outdated ice cream maker, produces cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the cooling box with a spatula, wipes it into a wafer and sells it.
You don&#39;t have to go to Anzola dell&#39;Emilia in the province of Bologna to find out.
But those who want to learn even more about ice cream will not miss the &quot;Gelato-University&quot; of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the manufacturer of ice cream machines set up an ice cream university to make ice cream from his machines correspond to high Italian ideals everywhere.
There is a huge interest in the basic course for future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in our own ice cream parlor.
Some long for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others venture on the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country&#39;s industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a corporate consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian housewife Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency are crucial.
Luciano will not forget the southern and patriotic icing on the cake during his training: &quot;Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a good dose of romance.&quot;
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns the tap on the machine and the pasteurized white base cream flows out, the base of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the associate professor is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one experiment on one&#39;s own?
Luciano warns, to be carried away by the spirit of the times into the unknown.
Anyone who talks about ice cream &quot;only from natural ingredients&quot; has probably used stabilizers anyway - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream without stabilizers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will collide and the customer will eat the ice beans themselves.
Certain variations of the matrix are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are powders and creams.
&quot;Suppliers will try to force a lot of flavored ingredients on you.&quot;
&quot;But you should just experiment.&quot;
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from a white base that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa as a base for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now, participants in the ice cream machine course are allowed.
Luciano always has them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is performed with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn&#39;t have to taste more hazelnut when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when the balanced mixture highlights the taste of Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano takes out a device that determines the sugar content in the fruit (the winemakers measure the grapes from the grapes).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It is not only the device for the automatic production of the basic material that helps.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools it to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we cannot avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo soils himself and his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of control.
&quot;In every course,&quot; Maestro Luciano believes, &quot;it&#39;s only a matter of time before something like this happens.&quot;
Auditors in double light
The European Food Authority (Efsa) is linked to an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
The allegations have now been made by a group of Testbiotech experts, which is considered an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
&quot;It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well,&quot; Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have had a contract with the Ilsi lobbyist association for several years.
It is funded by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been instrumental in Efsa&#39;s control rules for genetic plants and thus has a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
The Efsa regulations are said to coincide in the whole paragraphs with the Ilsi documents and thus bear the manuscript of the industry, which should be checked by the office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has drawn attention to a conflict of interest.
Recently, the senior manager moved from Efsa without additions or a transitional period to the Swiss agrarian group Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
Radio for Central Germany (MDR) also recently revealed the personal connection of the EU-Office of Control with the industrial lobby, which aroused the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU MEPs.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, including those from industry, if they are of high professional quality, it is stated in one statement.
Experts working for Efsa are not required to have contact with industry.
But he must prove them.
Kuiper admits to working for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things to estimate the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist&#39;s contract.
Independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt, and that the response of genetic plants to environmental influences has not been tested.
&quot;We want to know, for example, what a genetically modified corn in the field will do,&quot; says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the whole genetic plant, which does not prove reliable results.
&quot;If no risks are sought, then how could they be found?&quot; Then asks the plaintiff.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
The researcher has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the United States, industry is now trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who are not connected to corporations.
In most cases, studies that are critical to companies are not published.
&quot;Industry controls security research,&quot; says Hilbeck.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night he stood in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is known: In September, excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, a billion-dollar reduction in the station.
When the construction was stopped, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft rough stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured several of these pieces.
&quot;These stones are relics.&quot;
&quot;It must not disappear.&quot;
It melts: &quot;Cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial.&quot;
When one cut open, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s going to do with those pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former French army ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all that arose during the demolition in Stuttgart.
&quot;It would be a shame to grind them into gravel or disappear into a landfill,&quot; he says in his office, a wooden booth that used to be a guard house.
He says they cursed and threatened him when all the newspapers said in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he talked for days with S-21 opponents.
And he explained to them that he could not be demolished at all.
And when that happens, it is most sensible when the stones are used further.
Then he took about 200 S-21-opponents each one about 80 kilograms heavy block, the price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also hope to return it during rebuilding.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a load of 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest was sold a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and pulled away whatever fit in the trunk and trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart have long since turned into &quot;walls&quot; or as the edges of flowerbeds with herbs.
&quot;This stone is nothing special,&quot; says Rongen.
&quot;If it weren&#39;t for the political nipple.&quot;
He gets in his off-road car and goes for a ride through his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then became interested in computers, and eventually became a stone dealer.
And a lover of stones.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He collects his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he is the largest trader of old stones in the republic.
It brakes.
In the snow lies artistically worked sandstone.
&quot;They once belonged to the Marien Bridge in Dresden,&quot; he says.
The sandstone of the Elbe, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
&quot;My favorite stone.&quot;
We continue on our way up through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe railway station.
And further.
&quot;Nice travertine.&quot;
The blocks once belonged to the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
There are stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatt-travertine from the police presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how stones used to be smashed by hand and transported using simple hoists and bull carts, he becomes completely respectful.
&quot;It would be a scandal if something like that was crushed.&quot;
He did not become rich, not very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener settled up in the woods.
&quot;We work hard, but it&#39;s satisfying,&quot; says the one who evaluates the leftovers.
He has to go to Kolín in the near future.
Stones will also be saved there.
Fighting talents for high-potentials
There are a lot of people at the snack bar.
16 students are pushing for sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited engineering and design students to a workshop.
Together with VW developers, they have to talk about the car of the future - and just by the way get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies strive to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, as does VW, and rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: Recruit the most talented graduates in the lecture halls as soon as possible, before they enter the labor market and others are interested in them.
Because universities do not publish any success lists for their students, companies seek to discover and acquire exceptional talent in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the car group is trying to gain talent the next day.
One young lady from the personal department is handing out pens, gummy bears and boards with the VW logo.
It tells promising young talents about internship programs, student jobs and suggests trips to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
He sees benefits for both parties: &quot;Students will get in touch with industry and gain experience.&quot;
&quot;At the same time, VW can get to know the students, get to know the interesting candidates better and think about who would be suitable as a collaborator.&quot;
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
But the novelty is that he fights so openly for students.
&quot;Otherwise, it was more of a substantial professional project,&quot; says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer select their employees from long crowds of candidates.
On the contrary, it must strive and seek to attract a particularly highly skilled workforce.
Above all, graduates of engineering fields have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called shortage of engineers will increase.
Roman Dykta is a talent hunt for the auditing and consulting company KPMG.
It organizes demanding Recruiting events, such as the KPMG-Race, a type of modern treasure race in which participants have to find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students around the US next year.
Participants can also view KPMG branches and get to know the company.
It will be decided in advance in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested parties will fly to the USA.
According to Dykta, increasingly tough laws will apply in the battle for High Potentials at universities.
&quot;We want to be different from others with our Race.&quot;
&quot;A simple sailing trip was too little for us.&quot;
Dykta&#39;s talent hunter seems to be lucky.
&quot;We stayed in touch with all participants in a similar event last year.&quot;
&quot;Some of them will finish their studies soon and plan to apply for a job with us,&quot; he says.
In addition to being addressed directly on campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular present themselves classically on the labor markets.
&quot;We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions.&quot;
&quot;Like at Intersolar,&quot; says Sitha Stübe, head of human resources at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
Currently, 35 positions are listed on the company&#39;s website.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to fill vacancies right now.&quot;
&quot;It costs a lot of time and money,&quot; he says.
Another option is to contact professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
&quot;Professors inform that it is possible to practice or write a diploma thesis with us.&quot;
The solar specialist does not organize any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company seeks to attract other benefits: a personal atmosphere, a low hierarchy and easy communication.
&quot;Large corporations often can&#39;t offer it,&quot; says Stübe, head of the personal department.
Money has not played a major role in job search for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in one study by the Great Place to Work institute.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, it asks co-workers how satisfied they are with their work and work environment and monitors the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the Stübe personnel department hopes that the placement will bring her points for job seekers.
&quot;I think that those interested are especially informed about external evaluations of a potential employer,&quot; he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr Kriegler, this means above all internal measures.
&quot;The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,&quot; he says.
Technically, this is called internal Employer Branding, ie the promotion of the employer in the market within its own employees.
&quot;Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors.&quot;
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise their employer among friends and acquaintances.
&quot;It&#39;s like a string game,&quot; says Kriegler.
Obama is stopping new oil rigs
During the following years, no new oil wells will be built off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The Washington government has issued a ban - canceling earlier plans.
New drilling is also banned off the Atlantic coast.
Home Secretary Ken Salazar said it on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion at the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; drilling rig in April.
Prior to the disaster, which cost eleven employees life and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled pressure from opposition and industry to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents are trying to reduce the US&#39;s dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
The center of criticism is the British energy concern BP, which is confronted with billions in demands.
The commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama is due to present its results in December.
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent such a catastrophe by tightening controls and strict security regulations.
At present, the control office is being fundamentally reformed, drawing its attention to many corruption allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would abolish the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that stricter regulation will significantly reduce the volume of oil extracted in the Gulf.
&quot;Government plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the gas and oil industries,&quot; said the result of a recent industry survey by the consulting firm BDO - even before the ban on drilling on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about uncertainty in the industry: &quot;No one knows exactly what will change with regulation.&quot;
Investments in new mining projects are being postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area has burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of spilled oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni area of Nigeria.
People make a living from theft, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; the environmental activist reassures journalists: &quot;You still get enough oil in front of the lens today.&quot;
The 37-year-old Nigerian watched an attempt to photograph a boy wading across his chest with water surrounded by smudges: the scene looks almost beautiful in a rainbow of rainbow colors.
The fact that brown oil precipitates float beneath the surface is not visible.
She used to collect enough shrimp in containers, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, large amounts of oil spilled into a vast, humid area from broken lines.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to reach the waters where the fish are: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is one of the worst-infected areas in the world.
On the way along the river through mangrove swamps with many side tributaries, the entire range of the trigger is only noticeable.
The engine on the boat boils brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever dips their hand in the water pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves rise from the ground like black sticks of licorice, rare palm trees let their leaves hang sadly.
We search in vain for flocks of birds that commonly occur in humid areas: As soon as the engine on the boat stops, it sprawls in a former paradise, where it smells like a pump, a haunting silence.
&quot;What&#39;s going on here is ecological warfare,&quot; says Celestine Akpobari sadly. &quot;We live in constant fear for health.&quot;
A comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where fighting has been going on for several decades: the first European conquerors flocked here more than 60 years ago, where the first resistance with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa took place in the 1980s, where Shell had to stop in 1993 its production because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire three-size delta area of Switzerland with more than 5,000 production wells and 7,000 kilometers of more than two million barrels of black gold is mined daily, the oil fields in the Ogoni area are fallow, the situation is very unstable.
Every few hundred meters, a steel structure rises from the water like a bizarre statue: &quot;Christmas trees&quot; are so tenderly called the heads of drill holes.
They are 50 years old, most rusted to the mark.
Every now and then, such a drill head breaks, Akpobari says, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion liters have leaked into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil leaked into the sea off Alaska in the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; supertanker crash 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There is controversy over who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell identifies sabotage and organized oil theft as more than 90 percent pollution, environmentalists are talking about cracking wells and leaking lines as the root cause.
Shell demands much lower safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, the group accused in 2008 of US-American scientist Richard Steiner: Only the number of line failures is said to be &quot;several times higher than elsewhere&quot;.
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-stained open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to their necks from oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by a line, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire is burning: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group&#39;s leader.
First, gasoline flows out of the line into a collecting pot, later kerosene drips at the end of the line and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four co-workers produce up to four 300-liter barrels a day: &quot;We&#39;ll earn 34,000 Nairas&quot; - about $ 22.
Delta residents are exploiting a chronic fuel shortage in Black Africa&#39;s largest oil state.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of 40 cents a euro per liter of diesel can still be beaten by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from &quot;bunkers&quot; who connect to power lines everywhere in the Ogoni area: according to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost to the country every day in the entire Niger River Delta area.
But only a negligible portion of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally processed: the largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, which include politicians and high-ranking military officials, in tankers and sold on the world market.
The debate over whether the disaster was caused by the inhabitants and their interventions or the lax method of production is considered by activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
&quot;If oil companies were not considered intruders and did not completely destroy the lives of fishermen, then there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries.&quot;
In the meantime, however, Ogoni&#39;s relationship with Shell in particular is so damaged that only the departure of the concern is possible: &quot;Perhaps other nations will prove to be better than the Chinese.&quot;
Michael is uneasy.
&quot;It&#39;s high time you disappeared,&quot; says the muscular manufacturer.
&quot;Soldiers can come at any moment.&quot;
If a special military unit found them, they would not face imprisonment, but a painful bribe.
Soldiers, most of whom come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - also want to profit from the raw material.
&quot;This damn thing got our ground to the bottom in every way,&quot; says Akpobari.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous structural flaw in the A380 engines
The A380 obviously has a major safety flaw.
During the inspection of the machine, which made an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible construction error, which could lead to a &quot;catastrophic engine failure&quot;.
Qantas airline wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas Airbus passengers were probably more fortunate in their emergency landing in early November than was previously known: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority found a major safety defect in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction flaw.
A possible malfunction would have serious consequences: cracks could form on one oil connection due to wear, the ATSB&#39;s statement said this Thursday.
This could lead to a &quot;catastrophic engine failure&quot;.
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed the grounds of the lawsuit with the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal action against the company.
Qantas boss Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts came loose and damaged the bearing surfaces.
Rolls-Royce identified burning oil as the cause of the damage.
Up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide after this event.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety deficiency was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily left three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 engine as a safety precaution.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nationwide snowfall will cause chaos in traffic
Germany all in white: it snowed overnight in almost all over the country.
Chaos reigns on many roads, and connections between trains and planes are disrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: almost the whole republic fell on Thursday night in freezing temperatures with snow - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In some places to the north and east there is up to 15 centimeters of snow.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in use, but it could not handle the newly blown snow.
In addition, there was a strong gust of wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a stormy influx on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the morning with a water level 1.2 meters above normal.
Snowdrifts have caused considerable problems on motorways and state roads in Saxony.
According to Meteomedia&#39;s bad weather headquarters, therefore, the level of alarm in Saxon Switzerland was purple - the highest level ever.
In part, 30 centimeters of new snow fell, strong and fresh winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars remained there at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police reported major road problems.
On the A2, the wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia there were problems due to snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, major difficulties occur in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken overhead lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, one ICE had to stop in Munich.
165 passengers received woolen blankets, food and drink from firefighters and rescuers on the train.
The snowy wind blew across the road.
Many flights were canceled at large German airports due to snow winds.
According to a spokesman for the flight information center, canceled flights have already been reported from Munich.
According to a Fraport spokesman, 40 flights have been canceled in Frankfurt am Main.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
Although only a few passengers remained unconnected at the airport, there are 400 field beds ready for them.
There were accidents on many roads as early as Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in East Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Due to a snowy road, a similar accident occurred near Nuremberg: a truck was caught at a level crossing here because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg therefore remained closed until the morning hours.
And a 30-year-old woman died after she rolled over on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light powder, and therefore it will rise even in light gusts of wind.
But the wind will weaken.
Only in the Baltic Sea will there be fast winds with the force of a storm.
But it will be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to a newspaper article, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could yield up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt&#39;s banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, the bankers were allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now the financial group seems to want the renovation costs back again - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, according to the &quot;Financial Times Deutschland&quot;, referring to a spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the planned sale.
&quot;We are still researching whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it again,&quot; he said.
With this, the largest credit institute in Germany again gives up its corporate headquarters after a short time.
The bank took over the twin towers only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of its own fund and subsequently costly renovated them.
According to the data, the energy reconstruction swallowed around 200 million euros.
The sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper text, experts in the field estimate the value of the towers renamed &quot;Greentowers&quot; in the meantime at a price of around 500 million euros.
The spokesman said it was undecided whether the building would be resold to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn the dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the memory of buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
The dead have still not been rescued because the security situation in the shaft remains complicated.
Nearly two weeks ago, there was a powerful explosion in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 were overwhelmed in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident had occurred, but found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
It was still not possible to free the dead.
Now the relatives and friends are honored in memory of the dead.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand in sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the memory of the buried miners, 29 tables were built, on which helmets, flashlights and the names of the miners were placed.
Pictures and personal items such as clothes and surfboards have also found their place here.
Flags were flying half-masted on state government buildings.
New Zealand hoped the miners would come out of the &quot;depths of the earth&quot; again, New Zealand&#39;s Prime Minister John Key told the participants.
&quot;But they never came home.&quot;
He can&#39;t say goodbye to his son until he sees his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was overwhelmed in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and related victims, several foreign diplomats also took part in the commemoration.
During the explosion on November 19, British and South African miners were also overwhelmed.
Rescuers began by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As the toxic gases dissolve, the high temperatures inside the mine begin to cool, Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Hell, warriors!
Is horror suitable for art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome the old frontiers again with his fighting epic &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot;.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think when he shot &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot;?
The captive Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his opponents in large numbers with supernatural power - this sounds ideal for young men&#39;s spectators looking for bloody actions, because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and his enemies he even rips the entrails of the abdomen alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One-Eyed, as he is actually called, does not say a word during the whole film, and the other characters utter a maximum of one or two sentences or allow themselves to be drawn down to the miserable dying cries.
Otherwise, he is silent and full of the horribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts interested in existentialism and very calm camera shots.
It&#39;s good when a film has multiple audiences, it&#39;s just a shame if they&#39;re mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy on drug dealers &quot;Pusher&quot;, is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists bringing his works closer to the mainstream with either humor or less brutality.
Most fans of art cinema will probably be discouraged by splashing brains and guts everywhere.
Fans of action movies will be bored at the latest when One-Eyed sails to Jerusalem for a group of violent Christian missionaries for freely explainable reasons, hanging forever in the wind and fog before the team apparently sails to America and remains silent.
So it&#39;s no wonder that &quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; didn&#39;t hit theaters in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
It&#39;s a pity mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the distinctive facade, sometimes broken by blood, there is an exciting cinema, which deserved a little attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a precise plot, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream that became a film.
And it&#39;s not an escape for the viewer.
Refn does not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly suffocates him with his chilling shots and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, but above all the indescribable hatred that flows from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy who helps the One-Eyed retains something like innocence, everyone else is driven by malice.
Most of all, a one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, who in time will become a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil, for enemies and temporary allies.
It depicts destruction, but perhaps also only for the corrupt.
&quot;Walhalla Rising&quot; is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
Enjoyment.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA&#39;s Nuclear Energy Authority has new warnings about Syria&#39;s secret nuclear program.
But the country is resisting expression - and will not even allow inspections.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets will attack a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrat; The nearest larger town is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the International Atomic Energy Agency&#39;s (IAEA) documents, its name appears when it is a reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that branches off from the current.
According to a statement from the US-US Foreign Secret Service in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well-suited for the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technology from the fifties is not suitable for anything else.
The CIA presented a video with out-of-focus satellite images.
Using computer animation, she explained where the components of the reactor could have been before the destruction, it is supposed to be a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, photographs were submitted showing the building up close or even from the inside.
The reactor was said to be shortly before start-up, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, not much is known than then, the puzzles have even increased over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently announced in his memoirs that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but essentially had no evidence that the country had an &quot;active nuclear weapons program.&quot;
Some intelligence correspondents in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of an &quot;alleged reactor&quot;, although they consider the CIA&#39;s presentation to be &quot;credible&quot;.
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how confident he was in front of the reactor, a UN senior diplomat said in the summer, saying the IAEA had &quot;enough material to ask questions.&quot;
The rubble of the allegedly &quot;unused military building&quot; was quickly cleared by the Syrians and they also leveled the terrain properly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, the IAEA team, led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen, found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors from the time after the attack through the Member State, which should be more concise than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market because they were bought exclusively by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, this was refuted by the IAEA after particle analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, he banned the auditors from a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also stubbornly silent.
&quot;We will never comment on this,&quot; Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, the then ruling prime minister, recently confirmed his official position.
The investigation into this case has been in vain since June 2008 and is &quot;growing into a serious problem given the Office&#39;s credibility,&quot; as the senior Western diplomat at IAEA headquarters in Vienna acknowledged - a serious violation of the IAEA Treaty.
The IAEA considers three other facilities to be &quot;in working order&quot; with the alleged reactor to be the key to progress - and, unlike it, still exist.
At the same time, the auditors have not yet stated which devices they are, or what their function is or why they are suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
An independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified the objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite imagery, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Apparently it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - precisely for this reason, Syria refuses the IAEA access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was said that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance by the United States to search for military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the facility by the US Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence, as well as satellite images, that material has been transported here and there between the three sites and the square at Euphrat.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one facility should be &quot;related to fuel production&quot;.
However, there is &quot;no evidence of sensitive activities&quot;, ie uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium comes from, and where plutonium should later be split off into a bomb, there are only plausible estimates of these central questions.
It is also not known whether debris that could hide important traces is stored in these three places.
As if hundreds of truck loads have disappeared from the face of the earth, no one seems to have information on where the rubble has gone.
Only a few kilometers from el-Kibar, on the other side of Euphrat, lies the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria had inspected in 1998 as a suitable repository for radioactive waste, the IAEA considers unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked him to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane&#39;s Intelligence Review.
However, images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out earthworks at all suspected sites and removed large containers.
It may have been a coincidence, but it did not help clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months developing a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to maintain possible military secrets - only that effort shows how much interest auditors are.
Damascus, meanwhile, has rejected the proposal.
If a year ago Western diplomats reassured Vienna that the reactor had been destroyed and that the matter was not on fire, US Ambassador Glyn Davies had been talking for months about special inspections, one of the toughest means the Vienna Nuclear Authority has to enforce. control.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken of &quot;an option I am leaning towards in the future,&quot; but he is still hesitant.
This choice poses a great risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented are certainly not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, &quot;What happens when they don&#39;t find anything in the end?&quot;
Love in time of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on the still-naming directorial debut in the summer, problems have arisen.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known yet - but even that causes unrest.
There is persistent talk that a woman who is a Muslim falls in love during a war in Yugoslavia with a Serbian man who raped her.
Bosnian women&#39;s associations immediately protested, so the planned filming quickly moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has meanwhile been shot in Hungary and is in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Women&#39;s War Victims Organization wrote to UNHCR Jolie through the UNHCR and requested a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper now reported - Jolie is also the ambassador of the UNHF.
She is not exactly diplomatic - she offered women meetings in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie&#39;s attitude toward the victims revealed a lot about the script.
Her organization therefore recommended that the UN refugee aid organization release Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian said.
What scenes did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received a reading of her screenplay, allowed filming after minor tussles in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie still did not come.
The young author emphasizes that she does not pursue any political intentions in her film, that she has worked hard with the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains uncertain.
Another version of the film is circulating on the Internet, which really sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the war and meet again when she is dragged as a Bosnian Muslim to a Serbian camp, where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds a lot different than &quot;a rape victim falls in love with his tormentor.&quot;
The fact that the film Jolie really starts before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that she is under pressure that is &quot;not fair and based on misinformation&quot;.
Now they can be freed from her by the Hollywood heckers: by publishing her script illegally on the Internet, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone
This evening is good for the Irish again.
Not a trace of grief.
The home team dominates very much over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans roar with joy at the sound of loud music, stamping their feet.
The Bailey-Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is boiling as players throw tennis balls three meters into beer mugs - and hit.
&quot;Beer Pong&quot; is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus, as well as tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this screaming beer game and restrained computer scientist don&#39;t get along very well.
Nevertheless, the 26-year-old man is trying to have fun, to unwind from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a gaming passion in Las Vegas, he goes to an interview in New Zealand in January.
&quot;I feel so weird about it,&quot; he says.
&quot;It&#39;s so far and I don&#39;t have a job there yet.&quot;
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - &quot;she immediately got her dream job as an Eventmanager, maybe it&#39;s a good sign,&quot; says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner&#39;s three siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the foreseeable future, experts from the Scientific Institute for Economic and Social Affairs ESRI in Dublin predict.
They even count on 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a wave of emigration that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of rise that has brought great prosperity to the Irish, displeasure is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling for young, educated Irish people, who have so far experienced only a rise.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in these boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was wasted.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under the age of thirty are out of work.
There are many letters in the Irish Times to readers complaining: &quot;Everything goes downhill in Ireland.&quot;
&quot;There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but whoever can, goes away and our country loses a whole generation.&quot;
&quot;Last one, please go out.&quot;
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students&#39; Union, sees the future in the dark because the government is said to be misleading and offers young people no prospects for the future.
&quot;They reduce the minimum wage, but have no strategy to create new jobs,&quot; the 20-year-old says.
She watches her classmates move from one unpaid practitioner to another.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
&quot;The thought is sad and depressing.&quot;
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the &quot;WorkingAbroadExpo&quot;, an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of working abroad.
&quot;For beginners in the job market, working abroad is an excellent chance to take the first steps on the career ladder,&quot; says the manager.
His website features photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
Seán O&#39;Donovan has known for half a year about what it&#39;s like to build something elsewhere.
As the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues on a construction site in Germany.
He is currently building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
O&#39;Donovan, meanwhile, rarely gets home because he works extra shifts to repay a home loan at home.
&quot;Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy,&quot; he says when he crosses the threshold of his own house for the first time in a long time.
&quot;I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I&#39;m basically not at all.&quot;
He laughs awkwardly and walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a good neighborhood with well-kept gardens, in the entrances park large expensive cars.
O&#39;Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% financed by a loan.
&quot;It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions,&quot; he says.
Is he afraid that it might not turn out well with the loan?
O&#39;Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea and says, &quot;I don&#39;t have children to feed and I&#39;m young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again.&quot;
The civil engineer doesn&#39;t like the cries he hears so often now.
&quot;No one needs to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island,&quot; he says.
&quot;Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we will feel like Irish people.&quot;
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England during the last economic crisis.
&quot;After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply.&quot;
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep an open future and simply wait for life to develop elsewhere.
He has also worked in London for several years and why shouldn&#39;t it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that worries him a lot these days: his 27th birthday party on Friday in Dublin.
She&#39;s worried she might turn into a farewell party.
&quot;Especially no emotions,&quot; he says, drinking a lot of beer.
&quot;Goodbye, that sounds disturbing.&quot;
&quot;Let&#39;s call it the celebration of departure, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games.&quot;
Common practice of democracy
Democracy support in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen by many regions as more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latin Barometer survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
As the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
This year&#39;s survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related things.
The first is that Latin America is in a relatively cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Democracy support has increased significantly in several South Pacific countries in South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, democracy support has risen from a low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy was recovering from a deep drop in production last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are convinced Democrats, which pulls down the regional average (see Graph 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but a large increase compared to 2001, when it was 25% ( graph 3).
Roughly 34% said they trust the parliament in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same figures as last year, but a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
The support came during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America announced this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood varies across countries from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil&#39;s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inacia Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more serious and the state of violent crime has worsened.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem (see Graph 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they or their close relatives were victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
Massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents across the region say private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
About 58% agree that a market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, a percentage that rose from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela share this view (and 80% there support private enterprise), although their left-wing president Hugo Chávez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the region, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year). )
However, the United States is considered the most influential respondent country in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country be afraid.
The election meant ballot boxes and repeated ballots, ballots scattered along the canals, broken polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many relocated by the January earthquake, wandered around trying to find out where they could go to the polls.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed predecessors, shouted fraud and called for the cancellation of the election.
Protests, some of which were violent, spread throughout the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a high-ranking UN official in Haiti, said that &quot;it was a pretty good choice in many ways.&quot;
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they &quot;do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, may not necessarily have canceled the process.&quot;
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are owed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
Not all election hopes are lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, withdrew from their original call for the vote to be declared invalid.
However, a problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is identified by the electoral commission as having achieved a decisive battle.
Due to the rampant cholera epidemic and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there was concern that turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they were prevented from doing so due to disorganization.
Roughly 250,000 ID cards, which are necessary for voting, remained undivided shortly before the election.
There is a lot at stake.
Donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in Haiti&#39;s reconstruction.
And it is clear that the Haitians will take care of it themselves.
On tiptoe to the center
In the weeks when she suddenly became a widow, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, benefited from public sympathy, as her popularity rose from 20% to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Nevertheless, turning this success into a successful campaign for next year&#39;s election next year may depend on the grieving Mrs. Fernández giving up the uncompromisingness of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
And everything will be based on these characters.
Mr Kirchner, who continued his economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend more income at will.
Mrs Fernández&#39;s government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized when Mr. Kirchner died on a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (slapping and accusing the government of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
&quot;I&#39;m not going to argue,&quot; the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to next year, with the president having more room to spend as she pleases.
The economy is overheating: growth of up to 9% is likely this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists speak of a figure approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by economic collapse, set a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleansed INDEC, a statistical agency that monitored official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernandez now moderate this policy?
She called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by rising world export prices for Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a large devaluation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is making it known that she wants to restore Argentina&#39;s financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
President Fernández is now facing an agreement with creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $ 6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that the IMF should not be in sight, as usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the economy minister announced that the fund will provide &quot;technical assistance&quot; to design a new national consumer price index, which will commemorate the introduction to clean up INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after her term, when her husband is no longer by her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of the middle class, which is tired of Kirchnerism.
As Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will wane.
If she wanted to win another election, she would have to decide whether it would not be necessary to quietly renounce many of her husband&#39;s views on politics.
Half the encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, voted for mayors and city councils in five city districts, which can be considered a broader assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself represents the sentiments that prevail to the mainland and have a strong presence in business relations, including the Partial Free Trade Agreement, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
President Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayor&#39;s offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favor of greater Taiwan independence, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party&#39;s vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party, together with the KMT, was on city councils.
The election took place like most of Taiwan&#39;s elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass rallies with flags of scantily clad girls.
It even included a mandatory mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was lobbying for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
A man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien cleanly over his face, injuring him and killing the viewer.
It was bizarrely determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates struggled with plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China&#39;s military threats.
The KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP has also given up anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and realization that Chinese trade is crucial to Taiwan&#39;s economic survival.
President Ma confirmed on his part that China&#39;s policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The Beijing government can be expected to continue commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It will be better to wait for that after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000-08 was a rioter and a supporter of clear independence.
But under Ms. Tsai&#39;s leadership, a new generation has developed that is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was called as DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai published plans for research institutes to serve as a focal point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party is a &quot;credible alternative&quot; to Mr. Ma&#39;s hasty approach to China.
Mr Chen seems angry at this move.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen&#39;s intervention, the DPP will fight for choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr Ma&#39;s ratings were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go into the campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will reorganize its cabinet, as will local branches.
Strongly enforced proposals to support Taiwan in establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, &quot;the point from which there is no return has already passed.&quot;
Grammy Award Nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
Speeches at the request of the president and people are bound to notice.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is described as one of the surprises of this year&#39;s Grammy Awards with a nomination for Best New Artist.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since her album &quot;Esperanza&quot; was released in 2008, the nomination came a little late, but it&#39;s in line with the Grammy rules, where an artist may not release more than three albums before &quot; the public identity of the artist is established. &quot;
Her ambitious 2010 album &quot;Chamber Music Society&quot; has certainly taken a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and agile hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can speak of Spalding as a success that Norah Jones, the next equivalent for Grammy voters looking for a similar jazz work in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, Grammy judges rightly praised the Vijay Iyer Trio album &quot;Historicity&quot; in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride from the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against James Moody&#39;s album &quot;Moody 4B&quot; and James Beasley&#39;s keyboardist &quot;Positootly&quot;.
Trombone Shorty, a hoarse New Orleans favorite and a frequent guest on HBO&#39;s &quot;Treme,&quot; has been honored in the current jazz category, which is otherwise in favor of the albums of Stanley Clark, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild band Darcy James Argue&#39;s Secret Society with steampunk knowledge won several well-deserved awards in the big ensemble category, competing with chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and the still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet &quot;Pathways&quot; set a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical music category
Classical music nominations have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.
Leading the nomination are Michael Daugherty and his &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album &quot;Dreamhouse&quot;, an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees tied to Southern California were Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 &quot;Los Angeles,&quot; a work commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuting at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
LA-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to be awarded.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
The category for the producer of classical music of the year has five nominees, which are Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Bruckner and his Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra were nominated for a classical album; Daugherty and his &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; and &quot;Metropolis Symphony&quot; by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his &quot;Dreamhouse&quot; from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; &quot;Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati&quot; featuring various artists; and Verdi&#39;s &quot;Requiem&quot; from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and &quot;Lulu&quot; from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and &quot;Marc Antonio e Cleopatra&quot; by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and &quot;L&#39;Amour de Loin&quot; by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer&quot; by the Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for &quot;Deus Ex Machina,&quot; Hans Werner Henze for &quot;Appassionatamente Plus,&quot; Magnus Lindberg for &quot;Graffiti&quot; and Shchedrin for &quot;The Enchanted Wanderer.&quot;
Pärt&#39;s Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 for a performance recorded by the LA Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute episode is called &quot;Los Angeles&quot; and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and &quot;Mandolin Concerto&quot; were nominated for instrumental performances by a soloist with an orchestra.
The LA composer said he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avitala, who performed at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
&quot;I wrote it with Middle Eastern tones and a lot of North African rhythms,&quot; Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category for orchestral performance, for conducting the Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinsky&#39;s works.
Instrumental soloists who have received nominations include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were represented among the nominated vocal soloists this year, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of transition of the classics, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording &quot;Roots - My Life, My Song.&quot;
The planned mosque in Temecula receives the approval of the planning commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project, which promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, jurors decided Wednesday night that the new religious center would comply with local laws and be aesthetically pleasing.
&quot;Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you can remember,&quot; said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
&quot;As a American citizen, I&#39;m very proud of that.&quot;
&quot;It means that justice always wins.&quot;
&quot;Opposition is minimal,&quot; he added.
&quot;Those who are against just shout loudly.&quot;
&quot;We have really great people in our valley.&quot;
The meeting began at six o&#39;clock in the evening and lasted until almost midnight, when most of the time was spent discussing with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper&#39;s website.
&quot;America no longer exists,&quot; one comment appeared.
&quot;We are the Monkey Planet with the Statue of Liberty sunk into the sand.&quot;
&quot;America has fallen.&quot;
The planned Islamic Centers also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the tragedy that took place on September 11, 2001, when terrorists attacked New York.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had been suffering in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted more and more suitable space than the storage space he rented with a filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot Mediterranean-style mosque will also have two minarets and grow to a height of 43 feet.
It is supposed to occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council regarding the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbes increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space for new life forms on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth, claiming that it is a sign that life has possibilities that go beyond the main elements that have been considered and fundamental so far.
&quot;This organism has a dual ability.&quot;
&quot;It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic.&quot;
&quot;This fact is very strange, but it is not proof that it is a form of truly &#39;extraterrestrial&#39; life,&quot; commented Paul CW Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of a report that appeared in an online issue of Science on Thursday.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, the researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
&quot;You&#39;ll be amazed at what else is possible,&quot; said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for the search for life outside of Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on the news published for discussion, which did not reveal the details of the finding, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery &quot;shows that other planetary organisms may be able to use other elements that drive biochemistry and that the set of elements we consider &#39;standard&#39; may not be so absolutely necessary for life,&quot; explained Charles Cockell, a professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research. Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
&quot;This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure,&quot; Cockell added.
It was not an accidental finding.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA&#39;s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because of its high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that a microbe that is exposed to both elements may be able to replace each other.
&quot;Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus.&quot;
&quot;As a result, it is very difficult for organisms to separate these elements from each other.&quot;
&quot;However, arsenic is so different that it doesn&#39;t work like phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes,&quot; Anbar explained.
The researchers collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which the bacteria are able to adapt to and grow.
Microbes grow better when exposed to phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic replacement, there is an increased possibility that an arsenic-using life form may occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but there was never an example of this.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could be used by earlier life forms.
&quot;This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early days of the Earth,&quot; said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon&#39;s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower Motel were found. The Los Angeles area sheriff reported on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akitas and a Welsh Pembroke Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 Motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs late Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
&quot;The good news is that the dogs are fine,&quot; Whitmore said.
&quot;They&#39;re in good shape.&quot;
&quot;They have been handed over to their rightful owners.&quot;
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information about finding them.
&quot;The investigation is still ongoing.&quot;
&quot;We don&#39;t want to talk about it,&quot; Whitmore said.
&quot;We follow the rules.&quot;
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not found to comment on the case.
They were very happy when their two Akitas were found in a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff&#39;s deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
Akity Trace, a three-year-old male Trace and a 10-month-old female Didi, were unharmed, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, breeds of Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who planned to take part in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undetected until their discovery late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is only one stop on a couple&#39;s almost month-long trip to dog shows.
Peek and Rickard checked into the motel on Monday night.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took with them three dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany hound - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis were left in the car, where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported a car theft at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who would take them to the missing dogs. Dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether the prizes would be awarded.
The lion is ready to roar again now that the restructuring of MGM is gaining final approval from the court
After 18 months of shocks and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start again.
A New York federal insolvency judge on Thursday officially blessed a &quot;pre-packaged&quot; plan of creditors to settle about $ 5 billion in debt, clearing the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on the production and production of films and television shows.
With Thursday&#39;s ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the US Bankruptcy Code, MGM has no legal obstacles to restarting Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders of the lean studio.
The number of employees will drop to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge abruptly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources to enable a $ 500 million loan to finance MGM&#39;s new operations and production.
It is now a merger with an investment bank that itself needs $ 75 million and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances as management struggled to afford interest payments of $ 300 million a year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a sales specialist known for his work for Krispy Kreme Donuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of MGM and the studio&#39;s 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to sell the company by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay $ 2 billion plus the funds demanded by creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan. After months of discussions and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the lender at the end of October.
When MGM officially rises from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis &amp; Co., which has already received $ 1.2 million, will receive a payment of $ 9.5 million.
Cooper&#39;s companies, which collect $ 375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a success fee of $ 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has released only one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They also plan to co-fund two films based on The Hobbit, along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a special loan of between $ 265 million and $ 275 million to finance its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM&#39;s debt, was looking to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which it is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technological toys that keep your gift budget in balance
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system. In both cases, however, it is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $ 99, and one Kinect game costs the same as 10 bead skipping ropes or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers - Wal-Mart, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us and BJ&#39;s Wholesale Club - to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $ 80.
It was immediately clear that Moore&#39;s Law was working; This year&#39;s technology toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While relatively fewer new toys have appeared with associated sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices quoted are from Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, except as indicated otherwise.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $ 13, from 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you press their bellies.
With one press, the pet emits a tone and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can&#39;t stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 $, from 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animated doll on Elmo Live technology, which can play Simon Says and can also walk monthly thanks to its innovative folding leg with wheel lock.
Children test a Mickey Dance Instructor&#39;s toy, although their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you&#39;re a kid in the &#39;80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He&#39;s back, (Hasbro / Playskool, $ 40, for children from 3 years old), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn driving into the fun of working with a self-healing, funny workbook.
If you&#39;re looking for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech&#39;s MobiGo ($ 60, for children ages 3 to 8) is the cheapest, easy-to-use variant with a qwerty keyboard, although games do not have as effective instruction as Leapster Explorer ($ 70, for children ages 3 to 12), the first major a change in the Leapster range from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price ($ 90, for children ages 3 to 7) uses iTunes-like to download games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, the Scrabble Flash ($ 30, Hasbro, for children ages 8 and up) is a set of five dice that are no larger than a matchbox, each with an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before time runs out; it&#39;s great for competing in improvised word formation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two toys, Webkinz and Club Penguin, were the most represented in the toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2 &quot;Mix &#39;N Match Figure Pack, $ 5, for children aged 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include roller skates or a pet Puffle.
Slightly larger than the bristle of your toothbrush is the Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for children from 5 years old), the latest in a series of button-operated microrobots.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It&#39;s fun to make a maze out of cubes and see if he can find a way out.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in our dog&#39;s mouth.
Introduction of finer police control in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlling his orders and issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members - China&#39;s stout law enforcement officers, feared and despised for their harsh interventions and fondness for violence - to make a impression on the crowd of bystanders.
&quot;Stand up straight!&quot;
&quot;Hurry up!&quot;
Show them, he whispers softly, &quot;what pretty girls look like!&quot;
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood to attention.
The four pairs of black shoes are lined up like a ruler.
The four headgear fit perfectly on the hair, which is perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
&quot;Personally, I think they look average,&quot; Mr. Tang said scornfully.
&quot;The models are nice.&quot;
More than one government has sought to revive the image of city guards in China.
One city ordered the new conscripts to have a university degree.
Guangdong Province changed its gray-green uniforms to the supposedly more attractive blue.
In central China, Wuhan replaced stares with strong armament: in 2009, a report said 50 officers surrounded the snack cart uncompromisingly, staring at the owner until the door-to-door salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, an urban district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation as the main image.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its city police, selected specifically for their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The aim is to show, in addition to the gross side of the police, also the finer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into the secret Chinese city groups.
Critics would argue for a good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, impose fines and other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media commonly captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province beat a non-participating spectator to death after using his cell phone to film how they acted in an action to protest a landfill.
Last year, police training took place in Beijing, and the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. Among other things, the manual described how to effectively beat offenders without signs of blood.
This year, a door-to-door melon trader in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a brain injury.
One violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows Chinese police officers attacking a street vendor.
&quot;Chengguan scared the government,&quot; China Daily, the national edition, lamented last year after further discussion of tactics.
The paper said &quot;really clean.&quot;
Skeptics say such an approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are just a distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district required female candidates aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and &quot;five facial features in the right proportions.&quot;
Adepts should have a height higher than the diameter - ie higher than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the job is too mentally demanding for women over 25.
&quot;Their image is an important thing,&quot; one unnamed police officer told Rednet.com, as if on a government website.
&quot;Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which are then determined by others, including height, weight, facial features, etc.&quot;
Then comes the nature and &quot;inner qualities&quot;.
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, &quot;Apart from being vases, they will also have other responsibilities.&quot;
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city leadership, strongly disagrees with this description.
But he noted that height requirements are also common in China for other jobs, for both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the issue of good looks is the subject of debate among the Chinese.
Disability or mutilation certainly does not apply.
&quot;He cannot allow a lame or hunchbacked man to serve with us,&quot; Mr. Zheng said.
&quot;His image wouldn&#39;t be good.&quot;
Liu Yi, who is on patrol in Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn&#39;t think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
&quot;Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?&quot; she asked with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, &quot;Our job is to represent the image of the city.&quot;
They have no objections to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just driving traders into the aisles where they can operate.
Every morning, a group faces more than ten traders who run on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they are driven out.
&quot;Mr. Wang, you must leave.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;ve told you many times!&quot; said Miss Xu as the merchant began to run away, leaving his bicycle with a noodle cart for a while.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
&quot;Every day is basically the same thing,&quot; said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing in her free time.
&quot;Great routine.&quot;
One reason is that female police officers do not have the powers of their male counterparts to seize goods from dealers.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency, then, is to protect them from the sudden public acts of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
Hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, revolted this year after false rumors spread that police had killed vendors.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on the street corner.
Police confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry as he wished.
A 15-minute distance in front of the police, looking angry, with his elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator affiliated with the male group, remained behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over the age of 40 who already have only a supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in image maintenance and smoothing.
&quot;Sometimes we fight verbally.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes we fight physically,&quot; Mr. Li said matter-of-factly.
&quot;Mostly it&#39;s the public who starts it.&quot;
Prosecutors will not blame Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges involving his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure a lobby, lawyers told the senator on Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat facing Mr Ensign, a Nevada Republican, who, until the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair hit national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign&#39;s office said he was &quot;certainly pleased&quot; with the decision, which followed almost a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings before the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr Ensign&#39;s lawyers said the Department of Justice &quot;has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that there are no plans to bring further charges against him in this matter.&quot;
The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who argued that there was strong evidence that Mr. Ensign was planning a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published in the New York Times in October 2009 stated that Mr Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby to silence Mr Hampton and his wife, Cynthia. about the senator&#39;s relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer in the Ensigna campaign.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and supported their views after Mr Hampton was hired to lobby for them, so many documents and interviews state.
Until recently, Hampton was Mr. Ensign&#39;s assistant, and was expelled by law from lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual settlement of Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who had been friends before the affair, appeared to run counter to the ban on lobbying.
Evidence that was released &quot;revealed that this was a clear case for preparing for the violation,&quot; said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients under investigation by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasons for Senator Ensign&#39;s decision, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the ministry was cautious about political lawsuits after a number of setbacks, including last year&#39;s decision to suspend a lawsuit against the former senator. Ted Stevens amid allegations of wrongdoing by the prosecutor&#39;s office.
Federal prosecutors &quot;clearly hid their weapons,&quot; said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a law firm that has filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign.
&quot;It basically shows that high-ranking government officials are not subject to the law,&quot; she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign&#39;s chief lawyer, told him that he had been called by a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and then the next day, and that the ministry had found no charges against his client.
Mr Ensign&#39;s defense team is working with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, &quot;acted in accordance with the law.&quot;
Mr Coggins declined to clarify the legal arguments he had given to prosecutors.
&quot;It is not pleasant for me to describe the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except that we think they have made the right decision,&quot; he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop investigating a separate complaint in which the ethics group alleged that Ensign&#39;s parents&#39; payment of $ 96,000 to the Hamptonians violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that has long supported the senator.
An e-mail in December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton had joined the company as a lobbyist, Mr Ensign&#39;s chief of staff - John Lopez - had communicated with Mr Hampton and told him that he had &quot;pounded&quot; the Home Office on the subject.
Mr Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Secretary of Transportation to make an appointment on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr Hampton for lobbying.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After many months of stagnation, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for the third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of the crime investigation, his spokesman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Department of Justice and close the entire investigation.
&quot;Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the Nevada people,&quot; she said.
Cheshire&#39;s call is on Twitter
Half a dozen of them wrote in the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent news of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 messages on Twitter dealt with the rape and tying of children to beds in a house that was set on fire.
A trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, families, was held on Thursday, with an official end to the death penalty, which the jury voted for.
But Mr. Hayes&#39; lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that would probably take the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by top reporters - created a &quot;circus atmosphere&quot; and this widespread, immediate infiltration of information with outrageous details led the jury to make decisions in terms of public opinion.
This statement could force the judge to consider whether new technologies should also require new rules in the courtroom with the advent of new technologies.
&quot;As I experienced in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the incorporation of new technologies in the courtroom will affect the rights of a fair trial for individuals,&quot; said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr Hayes&#39; chief lawyer.
The trial judge Jon C. Blue of the state high court briefly rejected the allegations regarding last week&#39;s decree, stating that the media had been &quot;carefully controlled&quot; and that there was no evidence that the jury had acted under the influence of the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting on notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the process.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland chiropractor, Dr. Sheppard himself for the murder of his wife, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell, the trial was a &quot;carnival atmosphere&quot; for media reasons.
Some believe that the crime was the inspiration for the TV show and the movie &quot;Refugee&quot;.
Some lawyers said the appellate courts, which reviewed Hayes&#39; judgment half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be needed to determine how to communicate from courtrooms, as was the case with Dr. Sheppard unimaginable.
&quot;There is general cause for concern about the impact of new media,&quot; in highly watched cases, said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be interested in the idea that restricting direct communication from courtrooms could make the trial fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes&#39; lawyers, who would be able to argue for years to delay execution.
Lawyers also argue, for example, that Mr. Hayes&#39; case may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them terrifying criminal photographs when choosing a jury.
Some jurors said they were horrified by photographs of the victims of Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Lawyers say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge wrongly dismissed a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think at the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process may attract the most interest.
In an objection to last month&#39;s verdict, the case dominated news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by the governoral candidates and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media were constantly fanning the flames of emotion in this case.
&quot;The daily influx of media, cameras and reporters in court,&quot; the lawyer wrote, &quot;was something that has not been seen here in New Haven and may be a national rarity.&quot;
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that immediate reporting was more outrageous than reports reported later, and that, from their point of view, the judicial police should manage the scope of other trials.
But some lawyers have called on courts of appeal with the oft-used argument that social and technological change requires the courts to adapt.
Mr Hayes&#39; lawyers are seeking this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court&#39;s decision of 1966 in the case of the judgment of Dr. Sheppard, due to the breadth of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
&quot;This case,&quot; they wrote, &quot;represents the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century.&quot;
Can politeness bridge the gap?
After a campaign remarkable for its insult and negativism, a small amount of courtesy emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday&#39;s meeting between President Obama and parliamentary leaders did not bring any major discoveries on key issues that must be discussed during the session.
In each case, however, it was a polite discussion of the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as the definition of their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party struggle.
Wednesday&#39;s public meeting of the president&#39;s deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for several months has built up mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both parties are now in probation - probing each other for signs of collegiality and compromise, trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed party war.
Therefore, Tuesday&#39;s meeting and its later evaluation by the participants were also carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too vast and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the situation that has prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it&#39;s a question of taxes, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, Washington prepared the November elections at least quickly.
&quot;It&#39;s not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed,&quot; said Pete Wehner, a Bush administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
&quot;They are inevitable after the election.
The election aroused the emotions of the party members, who then fell silent.
It&#39;s good.&quot;
Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution on several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting.
Bush&#39;s tax cuts expired at the end of the year, and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits simply because Republicans cannot see how they support tax cuts for the wealthy while denying the unemployed unemployment benefits.
Following Tuesday&#39;s meeting in the White House, greater optimism can be seen about a possible agreement on these issues, together with the ratification of a new inaugural agreement.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to a relationship between the two political parties when the 112th Congress is convened in January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
&quot;After doing the things that need to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term,&quot; he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is widespread - that politeness will lead them to real cooperation.
&quot;I look at all the events between the present and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012,&quot; he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea party voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing they must live up to their promises and cut government spending and repeal the new health care bill.
These partisan lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult challenges in Washington and, in their view, are putting pressure on the public deficit issue in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in an 18-member commission to present their plan as an official recommendation, so they fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest resistance is among the elected officials in the jury, who suggest that we have little foundation or a will to compromise on financial issues, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, with Republicans calling on Obama to address the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is much evidence that despite partisanship in the last election, most Americans want to continue to see the two parties working together.
If it could move towards a stalemate, as it did in 1995, then both sides will be following the public&#39;s reactions very closely.
Anyone will be in danger of lowering their votes, likely to change course and seek a compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of things.
Party and direction are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and it appears that a greater ideological gap has emerged between Obama and the parliamentary republicans than has been the case with the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to the more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked US documentary depicts Moscow as a refuge for corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of the &quot;kleptocracy&quot;, which continues part of the bribes and bribes for protection that come on the way to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia said in records in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings to help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal shops but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the &quot;vertical of office&quot; - will take its toll as money begins to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published via WikiLeaks on their website on Wednesday.
The record is based on sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accused him of a large share of corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can observe only minimal changes in the purge.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent design firm, have consistently denied allegations of corruption for many years, and have won several lawsuits for false allegations for such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about proven evidence of corruption: &quot;It&#39;s crazy, it&#39;s dirt, it&#39;s crap.&quot;
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out in the vote.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details spoken in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
&quot;The government of the city of Moscow and its connection to the criminal elements have led some to call it &#39;dysfunctional,&#39; confirming that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than as a government,&quot; the report said.
&quot;Criminal elements enjoy the so-called &#39;krysha&#39; (a term from the world of crime and the mafia that literally means &#39;roof&#39; or protection) provided to them by the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Home Office and the State Department. representatives, as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
&quot;Analysts have identified a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow.&quot;
&quot;Luzhkov is at the very top.&quot;
&quot;The Federal Security Service, the Department of the Interior and the militia are in the second instance.&quot;
&quot;Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill in the blanks in some areas because the city doesn&#39;t provide some services.&quot;
The report says the FSB is taking money from the largest companies and the police are targeting smaller companies.
One source said, &quot;Moscow store owners realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Interior Ministry (rather than from organized criminal groups) because they not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law. &quot;
&quot;For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer on course.&quot;
The record says that while withdrawing money is complex, protection itself may already be a problem; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their shops close under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke several times about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably crammed with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
&quot;Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats in his fight against corruption,&quot; Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow&#39;s Indem research team, said in a recent interview.
&quot;But it&#39;s part of this bureaucracy.&quot;
&quot;It is not part of the political class because political classes no longer exist in Russia.&quot;
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $ 300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by Transparency International (ranging from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US embassy&#39;s report, which did not appear in Moscow until late in the evening, certainly did not provoke enthusiasm with the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov could be blamed for Moscow&#39;s shortcomings could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue .
In an interview with CNN with Larry King, Putin said the documents WikiLeaks had released could be forged and reacted angrily to a statement that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedeva Robin.
&quot;The truth about the whole thing is that it is our interaction that is an important factor in domestic policy in this country,&quot; he said.
&quot;But to be honest, we didn&#39;t think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethically.&quot;
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to come to terms with the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
&quot;Everyone here loves Ta Moka.&quot;
&quot;He was a good leader and took care of his people,&quot; said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a &quot;butcher&quot; for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote Khmer Rouge state in northwestern Cambodia, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge resigned, long-standing loyalty is also shattered in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims of a truth and reconciliation forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that, for the first time, explain to children the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, the UN and a Cambodian court jointly sentenced the former Khmer Rouge member to the 35-year prison sentence of a former leader, the notorious Tuol Sleng violent association Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Ghost.
With each such progress, unrest has increased among Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to re-integrate into Cambodian society.
&quot;There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything,&quot; said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodia, an independent organization that is researching the regime.
&quot;For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime became a symbol of evil.&quot;
&quot;It divides families.&quot;
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or starved to death or illness.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move to a government that culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1996. 1998
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persevered, was captured in 1999 by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically recall the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
&quot;These people have benefited little from the surrender,&quot; said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
&quot;They are surrounded by the regime&#39;s utopian agrarian ideology.&quot;
&quot;They were brought up without any idea of doing business.&quot;
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
&quot;Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,&quot; he said.
&quot;That Mok fed them all.&quot;
&quot;But now life is hard because we have to take care of everything ourselves.&quot;
The ongoing Khmer Rouge trial has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute leaders and people responsible for crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
There was little to allay fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has centered on Im Chaema, 64, who was the regional leader in Banteay Meanchey Province during the Khmer Rouge regime in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that is likely to have killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from field work to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over the arid grasses, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
&quot;There is peace in Cambodia and it is stable,&quot; she said.
&quot;If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.&quot;
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court sought other suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
&quot;Cambodia needs to dig a deep hole and bury the past,&quot; he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
&quot;Reconciliation in Khmer conditions means sticking together broken pieces,&quot; he said.
&quot;It&#39;s our duty to put these broken pieces together so we can understand each other.&quot;
The center published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, has 75 pages and is entitled &quot;History of Democratic Cambodia.&quot;
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education&#39;s history textbook, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng knew little detail about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city&#39;s connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically as he took home a book to study.
&quot;My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts,&quot; he said.
&quot;They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be prosecuted.&quot;
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still have a strong charm here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains is a weed-covered path littered with discarded plastic bags that leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot&#39;s body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone saleswoman at the side of the road, said she didn&#39;t know much about the man who had been cremated there.
&quot;But he has a strong spirit, many locals come here and pray to him,&quot; she said.
Nuom Sothea&#39;s birthday was planned to visit Pol Pot&#39;s resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees that it appears to have a stockpile of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama&#39;s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarussian government announced on Wednesday that it would give up its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was announced in a joint statement issued after the security summit by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the US government has tried to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and they seemed to have stumbled upon the stumbling block last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a few covert operations had been carried out with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday&#39;s agreement to remove the rest of the material - about £ 500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama&#39;s 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was decommissioned.
And it was probably a good move to secure an invitation to the former Soviet Republic to a subsequent summit in 2012.
&quot;I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the Nuclear Safety Summit in 2012.&quot;
&quot;This proves that the process works,&quot; said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety support group.
Clinton called the agreement a &quot;very important step&quot; from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium reserves.
Belarus will be seventh.
A dozen countries did so under George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama summit on nuclear safety, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
&quot;We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium,&quot; Lukashenko said.
&quot;It&#39;s our commodity ... We don&#39;t intend to make dirty bombs, nor do we intend to sell it to anyone.&quot;
&quot;We only use it for research purposes, that&#39;s all.&quot;
However, Belarus joined the United States a few months ago and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The US government has spent $ 13 million on the program, most of it to supply the Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
&quot;Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust,&quot; which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Studies this year estimated that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of uranium usable for weapons production.
According to the joint statement, Belarus will work to eliminate its stocks by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko&#39;s brutal repression of human rights.
But Wednesday&#39;s statement suggests the possibility of a gradual melting.
&quot;We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that stronger respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains fundamental to improving relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its people,&quot; he said.
The Spanish government did not make expensive CIA flights
The Spanish government did not bother with CIA flights carrying imprisoned Taliban and Al-Qaida members to Guantánamo through Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the United States envoy in Madrid.
This is according to documents provided by the Wikileaks server to the daily El País, which also states that the then First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed and &quot;could show that it has proper oversight of foreign aircraft passing through Spanish airspace &quot;.
In June 2006, following a statement from the Council of Europe accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting took place between US Ambassador Eduard Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said that the Council of Europe&#39;s statement &quot;took Zapatero&#39;s government out of the game&quot; and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Vega emphasized that Spain had no problem with secret service flights over its territory.
&quot;They simply want to be informed&quot; so that they are not &quot;caught unprepared,&quot; Aguirre said in a document.
The then Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also indicated to the US ambassador that the Spanish government &quot;wanted to keep the matter as low as possible, but because the matter was in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited scope for influence.&quot;
in February 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he did not intend to block the judge&#39;s initiative to request the declassification of National Secret Service (CNI) and Ministry of Defense documents relating to CIA flights.
&quot;This information does not contain any incriminated file or any sensitive information,&quot; the Embassy explained after talking to the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern for &quot;apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors&quot; rather than for declassifying CNI or Ministry of Defense information.
&quot;This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments,&quot; Aguirre said.
In March 2007, at a luncheon for US Ambassador and Home Secretary Alfred Perez Rubalcaba, the ambassador told the ambassador that &quot;although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they see fit,&quot; he instructed his colleagues avoid angry comments with the intention of reducing tension &quot;.
The ambassador also expresses his concern about the actions of the political party Partido Popular (PP) in this matter.
&quot;Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Partido Popular will not hesitate to use any indications that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if that these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government, &quot;he notes.
Admitted mother-murderer complained on the network about maternal &quot;worries&quot;
A young woman talked about a child when she was dead and had her blog: &quot;Terror po galicijsku&quot;
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself &quot;Muki&quot; on the Internet.
with this nickname, which she had used since childhood, she communicated with her cousin and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the La Coruna region where the young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman&#39;s emotional life, which the ABC daily reconstructs with the help of the testimonies of her family members.
A woman in Thirty from Galicia entered into a relationship with the industrialist Iván Túnez in 1998.
They dated for one year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn was his, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to Palma to visit her for a week.
However, it is clear from the content of her communication that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: &quot;Alberto is kind of upset that I left for work.&quot;
&quot;When I told him, he thought it was good, but now he realizes he has to be with the little one all day and he can&#39;t do whatever he wants.&quot;
Then he talks about the text message he just received: &quot;I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I should send your baby&quot;.
He complains: &quot;If he doesn&#39;t like me leaving the baby with my mother, I&#39;ll marry him when I get back,&quot; he says.
in May, he talks about his return to his home: &quot;I will go there this week, but I will only stay until the 19th, because I have to go to work on the 20th to avoid losing my place.&quot;
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son with him.
&quot;He will be with who he is supposed to be with, that is, with me, and it will never happen in my life that I would leave him with anyone other than my mother,&quot; a dubious intention given her bad relationship.
there is another post in july.
When he types this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month and was probably murdered on the 10th is already dead.
&quot;Caesar is satisfied on the one hand, but not on the other.&quot;
&quot;On the one hand, he&#39;s with me and he quite likes it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day.&quot;
He&#39;s talking about moving to Mallorca.
&quot;He (his son) will go to summer school there, so I&#39;ll save some money for a babysitter.&quot;
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
&quot;A big kiss from Caesar asking me when you&#39;re coming.&quot;
&quot;Alberto says he sent you I don&#39;t know what videos to email, look how he wants, he&#39;ll meet me, sex is needed.&quot;
Another 30th report: &quot;The boy is doing well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan&quot;.
There is also one report on Víctor, the current partner: &quot;He gives me money&quot;.
Mónička&#39;s posts on blogs dedicated to anime and manga are on the Internet.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she called herself &quot;Muki&#39;s ex-prisoner.&quot;
&quot;Galician terror (motto)&quot;.
The last man she lived with, the guardian, expresses her regret and feels guilty.
She doesn&#39;t want to believe that everything would happen because she didn&#39;t tell him she was a single mother.
Yesterday, Mónica entered the provincial prison in Palma, where she arrived from the Menorca detention center.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said that the defendant did not remember how everything happened and &quot;that she did not intend to harm the little one in any way&quot;.
Before that, however, she admitted that she had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric examination.
The People&#39;s Party would win 4 seats in the House and the PSC would lose 9 seats
with the results of 28 November, the PP party could have the main say at the town halls in Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the number of votes cast and the number of experienced MEPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP already has the idea of a general election, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in national elections is usually once the same as in Catalan elections.
in 2008, the Catalan People&#39;s Party won 610,473 votes in the general election, compared with only 316,222 in the 2006 autonomous elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People&#39;s Party of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which was supported by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of PP voters, is maintained, the party&#39;s analysts calculated that if general elections were held, the PPC could gain 12 members in the House compared to the current 8, the CiU (Convergencia i Unió, in Czech Shoda a unie - note the translation would also win 4 seats (now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers&#39; Party).
According to this analysis of the People&#39;s Party, the ERC would lose one member - it now has 3 - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate or another next.
However, according to the election calendar, the next meeting will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the People&#39;s Party could also have a decisive influence on the end of socialist rule in the four provincial capitals and changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona). from the administrations with the largest estimated budget - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Both nationalists and people agree that the PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not receive a majority and could not turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and the ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona City Council - as at least 5% of the vote must be obtained.
The PP party increased the number of votes won in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP party in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
in Lleida, the PP received only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Marian Rajoy - they met on several occasions during the last campaign.
The People&#39;s Party also won at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels and Reus.
Currently, PP is represented at 34 town halls in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona formed a Thai-led jihadist cell, which issued passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the &quot;Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam&quot; and &quot;Lashkar-e- Taiba &quot;, with the latter group being the perpetrator of the Mumbai bombings, which killed 106 people in 2008.
The Interior Ministry attaches great importance to investigating the matter, aiming to ensure the weakening of al-Qaeda&#39;s counterfeiting apparatus at the international level through &quot;Operation Kampai&quot; and thus &quot;limit its operational capabilities.&quot;
Investigators estimate that during the two years it has been active in Catalonia, the cell could send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then forged and then delivered to groups that make up Al Qaeda&#39;s criminal galaxy so that their &quot;fighters&quot; could travel with impunity. across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell was not the only one active in the jihad network in Europe, so other European police forces, in addition to the Thai services, also took part in these investigations, so it cannot be ruled out that other European countries will not intervene in the coming days. in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) were detained, in which Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was these men who ran a cell from Bangkok based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was liquidated in 2009, stole passports that met Islamist requirements, especially from tourists.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45, had to be valid for several years and without visas.
Investigative documents emphasize that no facts are yet known to link detainees from Catalonia to the Mumbai bombing, although the perpetrator of the attacks, &quot;Lashkar-e-Taiba&quot;, was supposed to be one of the groups accepting passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before the assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency, which were &quot;invested&quot; to buy cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the &quot;command&quot;, which killed 106 people.
Police have already confiscated a lot of evidence.
The People&#39;s Party (PP) demands that Mas stop the fiscal agreement
The chairwoman of the PPC (People&#39;s Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchez-Camach had the opportunity yesterday to present to Arthur Mas in person her conditions, under which she is willing to support his inauguration as President of the Generalitat; these conditions are the same as those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revive the economy and give up risky ventures, such as the economic agreement that the nationalist leader wants to propose during his term.
The chairwoman of the Catalan People&#39;s Party attended the meeting with Arthur Mas with the certainty of 18 seats received in last Sunday&#39;s election, a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the opposition formations to abstain. to the office.
The future alliances that the nationalists in the House would like to hold when the general elections take place depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but so far the talks that the Mas is currently having with the rest of the political leaders are in the Catalan spirit.
As for the president of the PP, in order to gain her support for the inauguration, &quot;she will have to end all sovereign and liberation speeches,&quot; as well as an economic agreement - similar to the one in the Basque Country - that the CiU leader even wanted to vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to streamline the overcrowded political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mas&#39;s inauguration will be discussed by PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised stiff opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths were not due to a &quot;lack of action&quot;
The performances of the Olot center do not rule out that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the geriatric center La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, a carer who - while employed - killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
Accompanied by the facility&#39;s lawyer, Joan Canada&#39;s lawyer, Joan Sala, the director of the nursing home, announced that &quot;La Caritat&#39;s wish could be indicted against the perpetrator&quot; responsible for the murder, but &quot;legality and responsibility oblige us to leave the process authorities &quot;.
In addition to the damage to reputation that this institution may suffer because it did not detect the carer&#39;s criminal activities in time, the demands for material compensation, which are already calculated by the lawyers of the families of the survivors, are now a major threat to La Caritat.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime had taken place in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of clients of a home for the elderly, suspecting that in many cases no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled over the phone.
La Caritat, through its director, resolutely rejected this extreme yesterday, stressing that &quot;the lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened&quot;.
La Caritat&#39;s lawyer added that &quot;there are no indications in the case that any third party other than the accused himself has committed a mistake&quot;.
The man, now nicknamed the &quot;Angel of Death,&quot; admitted 11 deaths yesterday, specifying that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed a second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, he caused death by administering too high a dose of insulin, in contrast to the first case where he used a mixture of sedatives.
Director La Caritat said it was difficult to control staff access to medicines.
Insulin and a sedative cocktail were likely in six of the nine remedies the caregiver used to kill patients in an effort to relieve them of suffering.
However, only the analyzes currently underway in the laboratory should show whether Vila was not lying and actually looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them with lye, as he admitted in the case of three women killed between October 12 and 17.
in La Caritat do not believe the medical claims, nor do they rule out that the number of killed may be higher than he admitted to, and justify their behavior in the various versions submitted by the Villa to the court, knowing that he must change his actions when it turns out he killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be available to the judiciary in order to shed light on the full scope of the matter.
The European Central Bank is in danger
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to yesterday&#39;s threat from President of the European Central Bank Trichet, who warned that &quot;markets should not underestimate our ability to react.&quot;
Marginal differentials closed by force and shares of European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank&#39;s ability to make a mistake - the euro has just risen above a critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market, which, although declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose his worries.
One month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us back with liquidity today, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the sovereign debt repurchase plan for inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the time limit and to leave unrestricted access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to forecast &quot;at least until March&quot; and adhere to a three-month auction with unrestricted access until the end of this trimester, in order to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying program and that they will even announce its intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations created, it will re-create the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly continue to withdraw the liquidity rate, God is with us!
The same was true at the May congress, where they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds, and markets collapsed - history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
in May, an armored fist announced on Monday and said on Wednesday that it had already bought many, causing another market crash.
Yesterday&#39;s bidding for one-year bills in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro spent only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, rates in Portugal fell by 30 points lower, reflecting the change in market sentiment that took place, according to Trichet.
in Ireland, figures have been published representing the losses of Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts are about 10,000 million in short-term securities and another potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after it did not reveal the problem through stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the relief plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need to get parliament&#39;s approval of the new budget and still does not have enough support, so uncertainty remains in Ireland.
Angela Merkel softened the tone of her speech to ease the tension in her face for the next EU leaders&#39; meeting on 14 December, at which a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven&#39;s Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the prime minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of measures, which will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment - in the ears of investors, it sounds like Four Seasons from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, double that of other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the National Bank of Spain was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key three-year bond auction that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which we hope will be in high demand, which will help dispel doubts about our ability to refinance.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us the cash we don&#39;t need - there are 40,000 million in cash available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - as well as high rates and market access would close for us sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use Cesar&#39;s wife&#39;s strategy - &quot;not only to be, but also to appear.&quot;
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen group will challenge the actions of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm in open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, has not subsided.
David Álvarez, the group&#39;s founder,, after considering him &quot;completely insignificant&quot;, will challenge El Enebro&#39;s lawsuit, scheduled for 16 this month and demanded by five of his seven descendants, in which they should try to force their majority and empower with the assistance of the administrative bodies of the power of attorney of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are fine-tuning the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over control of part of society.
The founder of the largest business services holding company does not seem willing to relax in his dispute over membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro group.
five of its seven descendants, who were appointed leaders during the shareholders&#39; meeting on January 18 this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register, were removed from its administrative committee.
The trial of the El Enebro group, scheduled for the 16th of this month, convened by an official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, resumed thunder in the womb of the Álvarez family.
An appeal to a judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of a commission until the dispute is resolved.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is seen by David Álvarez as &quot;a desperate means for his five children to use judicial deception and clear legal fraud to reinforce and improve the January 18 negotiations, which was completely invalid&quot;.
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge to this conduct as &quot;completely irrelevant&quot;.
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to convene a court hearing in June.
in El Enebro, a group that owns, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, seven descendants of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the group&#39;s founder requires a right of use for 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide when hearing the issue of litigation. The date of this hearing has not yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Ever since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the possibilities of this newcomer very seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, they all bet on Fernando Alonso&#39;s Ferrari triumph.
Without wanting to reduce the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula 1 - a &quot;secret weapon&quot; that the multinational Siemens placed in the hands of Red Bull to make it victorious. team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches, which a German company launched in 2007 for purposes very far from motorsport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision devices.
Its goal is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan&#39;s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens&#39; industrial division, explains that the use of this software device allowed the Red Bull team to make modifications and improvements &quot;within hours, in near real time&quot; that were otherwise detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
Today, the Red Bull team employs 180 young, highly qualified professionals equipped with powerful information technology to analyze and design each type of racing car modification.
The head of Siemens explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles except the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be translated from virtual reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical convenience is the amount of $ 40 million, the maximum that any Formula 1 team can spend in each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a high-tech plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its race cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a &quot;big secret&quot;.
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull in Formula 1 is without a doubt the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
Behind the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has invested in its participation in racing circuits, however, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable and yet no one knows them.
Production technology chief Steve Nevey says five years ago that advances in vehicle research and development contributed 50% to the victory, with the rest thanks to the drivers.
At present, this ratio has changed and technology is worth 85% of success, while pilots are contributing 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as they are &quot;unpredictable gladiators.&quot;
HP will set up 20 of its own stores in two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes, inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 stores with an area of 80 to 100 m2, which the multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrer, Spain&#39;s vice president of Spain, cited as an example the newly rebuilt store in Barcelona&#39;s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to establish 200 points of sale in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is third.
Herrer did not want to reveal where the other stores would open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herrer, who also runs HP&#39;s human resources systems, said the philosophy of opening stores would remain the same - using local distributors with industry experience and knowledge.
Here, the North American company advises on the exclusive design of store equipment (with products that can be tested interactively), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP also provides staff for stores.
Helena Herrer denied that it was franchising, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aimed to &quot;improve customer service, services for small and medium-sized enterprises in purchasing, service, after-sales service and even packaging&quot;.
The Barcelona store is part of a world-class pilot pioneering program to address potential problems with computer devices under warranty.
The online service is connected to the technical center based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
&quot;That way we can solve problems in 10 minutes, which can otherwise take up to two days.&quot;
&quot;This system is designed especially for small and medium-sized enterprises and for regular customers, given that large companies already have a contractual technical assistance service,&quot; Helena Herrerová emphasized yesterday.
Sabadell bets that it will &quot;steal&quot; one million clients from its competitors within three years
More optimistic than other bosses, Jaime Guardiola, a delegated board member of Banco Sabadell, believes 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts an end to the passive war.
Nevertheless, it expects to reduce interest rates, which they will try to compensate by reducing bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to acquire one million private clients in three years.
Sabadell has found a way to take advantage of the next three years and be able to survive in difficult economic conditions.
In 2011, the Bank will launch a new strategic plan valid for three years.
The aim is, in addition to surviving without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by attracting one million new private clients - or 700,000, if deducted by those who may leave the bank - as until now the institute has tended to pamper small and medium entrepreneurs and large companies than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share for private clients is 3.5%, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or also sobriety, in order to reduce costs, the challenges of which the bank will show when it presents the results for the period.
Few banking institutions at this time dare to set goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all of the world&#39;s banking plans.
Sabadell will close its Optima program, set four years ago, this year, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for another period.
Clients who leave savings banks will be their main target group.
At a meeting organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be &quot;difficult and very important&quot;.
Indeed, he believes that the road out of the crisis in Spain &quot;will be a long one&quot;.
In addition, it will be &quot;very difficult to create employment&quot; in two or three years, which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And although he believes that the passive war - which is reducing margins - is receding, the price of the risk premiums that banks and savings banks pay for their issues to obtain liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thus compensating for the reduction in margins.
&quot;The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on loans.&quot;
&quot;We haven&#39;t shut down the tap yet, but the differentials are very high,&quot; Guardiola admitted.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and raise differential prices - see CincoDías on 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking &quot;now is to reduce commissions&quot;, but there is a &quot;competitive framework&quot;.
Sabadell&#39;s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain &quot;larger sizes will be required&quot;.
&quot;There will be no stone left next year,&quot; he assured.
It confirms that capital needs are &quot;much reduced&quot; and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions will be in the red.
And he points out that FROB may substitute fundraising in the market before a new capital measure.
After reassuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary foreclosure, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
He notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA rules out another wave of savings bank mergers
Yesterday, the CEO of CECA denied that another wave of mergers of savings banks should arise, and again insisted on the speed with which the sector is being reorganized.
When the process of merging Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and wait for the second round.
However, José Antonio Olavarrieta, CEO of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), ruled out yesterday that a new wave of operations should emerge.
&quot;I believe that most of the mergers have already taken place, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening are conventions.&quot;
&quot;Most are completely done; it is possible that instead of 17 institutes we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already done and under the protection of the National Bank of Spain, which has cooperated very well in this matter,&quot; the director said.
In his statements at the ADEA meeting, Olavarrieta said that the process of concentration is proceeding &quot;at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the installments that took time, not now. , appeared in business plans with the National Bank of Spain, &quot;he stressed.
&quot;Moving from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty,&quot; he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that &quot;there are a number of unhappy opinions on the slowness of the process&quot; which show &quot;a lack of seriousness and understanding&quot; because &quot;what the National Bank of Spain is doing is a reminder that we must be on time before the end of the year&quot;.
Yesterday, CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta assured Spain that it has the strictest financial system in all of Europe and &quot;probably&quot; in the world, and attributed a &quot;lack of knowledge&quot; to those who question it.
The director noted that in the current favorable economic situation, &quot;we can be calm&quot; about financial institutions and savings banks and the system, which has mastered the &quot;very important&quot; process of concentration and which continues at the &quot;highest possible speed&quot;.
He also recalled that Spanish banking had done very well with the stress tests conducted by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the red German line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from tax cuts for SMEs, through regulation of private employment agencies or the abolition of € 426 for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic control - note. Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, on the other hand, has criticized Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
Let it be said in advance that Merkel&#39;s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be like, which runs into the idea of following old traditions, which is held by a large part of other members.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also, for example, Austria and the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to March - although now it may seem like a scifi, this version has widespread public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to the German proposals, is to revise the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary rigor, fines for the offending states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and extending the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for dials now.
First, when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission encouraged deficits in 2009, the German government pulled a constitutional reform up its sleeve to prevent them from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of a discrepancy between what Germany considered to be the right one (plans for fiscal tightness and the stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel painfully dragged out the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of sharp criticism at the time, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to saving Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel reappeared with a clear position, calling for the European Union conventions to be reformed so as to allow a Member State to be rescued and at the same time to allow private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This view was interpreted as anti-European, as it accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat relaxed form, has been approved, and we should follow the Union&#39;s reform process in the coming months, which should enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although measures need to be taken now, with which it seems to disagree too much, the old functioning of the euro will come to an end from that date.
2013 will mark the birth of a new currency zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to announce deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the cost.
Germany suggests that we must take a strict path of growth with increased savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital buffers.
They simply do not intend to tolerate another option based on receivables and building, with huge balance of payments gaps that prevailed in the years of Spain&#39;s growth boom.
The offer is clear.
And we would be wrong if we didn&#39;t understand.
It is not just a matter of restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we could be wrong about ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will be replaced by greater calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities they give us until the spring of 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero also seems to understand this, and his double statement (reforms promised after meeting with big business last Saturday and yesterday&#39;s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism from Merkel, the idea has opened up that things need to be put in place. all right.
However, the red line that Germany has drawn is here, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And leaving a eurozone full of not-so-serious countries cannot be ruled out from the possibilities that can be considered.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it has warned us.
Sport and circumvention rules
The tricks shown by Alonso and Ramos in the match with Ajax show wit, not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusions of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November have led to a sea of ink being written about whether or not this is unsportsmanlike conduct and whether UEFA might not have both footballers. punish.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team had clearly won), the players named deliberately wasted time one by one at the time of the foul to provoke the referee, who showed them a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will complete the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending up in the lead in their group - and will be able to continue to the next stage, stripped of their cards.
In the end, the UEFA Disciplinary Board sentenced José Mourinho to two matches and the offenders were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, ie rules that are unwritten but followed.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that it was attended by the Real Madrid team (which boasts nobility and honor in its anthem and which has already fined its players for similar acts) and, apparently, the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adding another episode to his comedian and provocateur&#39;s long history.
in any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of conduct, which is not explicitly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, ie whether these acts circumvent the law; these are indeed actions that respect sporting rules, but they seem to be trying to circumvent their meaning.
It deals with the type of damage such actions affect the sporting spirit.
One of the requirements of sports behavior is the physical inviolability of opponents, which was not violated in these cases, ie there was no violent game.
Another of these essentials of a clean game is to avoid that players have an advantage over the opponent&#39;s team due to their offense - which has not happened here either.
So paradoxical about the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as deception or circumvention of the law did not happen, there was no covert violation of the rules to avoid sanction, but this behavior was to be as obvious as possible in order to receive punishment.
They waited and gladly received punishment.
Another question, however, is what advantage the perpetrators will benefit from their intentional offense.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that there will be no benefit in the current match, as the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could jeopardize their participation in a future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so at first glance the team can be eliminated, and in addition, by doing so, players will be penalized and move to the second round of cards, in which one card less than round one.
So as the rounds continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that will allow you to get the most out of the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid being penalized (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or fleeing punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumvention is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly wit.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because it was two self-exclusions and because of the way in which the instructions for provoking them were transmitted from management.
Damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Fighting bids for holding Christmas parties in Barcelona
The dictation of the calendar this year concentrates the avalanche of reservations on 16 and 17 December.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid by the employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish delight or lotteries, with the advent of December comes the pre-Christmas parties, which still act as an oxygen bomb for Barcelona&#39;s restaurants and leisure facilities, but the crisis has resulted in a fight to win clients by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 on food. up to 30 euros, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations from this sector agree.
To complete the complication of numbers, the calendar this year (Christmas Day falls on Friday) concentrated requests for the week of December 13, creating an avalanche of bookings for peak days (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic in the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that have canceled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
To avoid abandoning tradition, many employees pay for parties out of pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of carrying capacity, says Gaieta Farras, president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona restaurant association.
At the moment, the representative of the patronage of restaurant facilities does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be like this month.
&quot;People think twice before making a reservation.&quot;
&quot;They want to get along, but they are careful about the issue of prices,&quot; he added.
The stores will go well for those &quot;who offer quality and good service at a reasonable price&quot;, he says, recalling that due to the crisis, customers tend to go down a step and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey of various facilities shows that the largest influx of booking requests is on the evening of 17 December.
The Soteras Group is announcing a real booking boom this Friday, with the most requests for spending up to 30 euros, which has been adapted by the offered menus, whose total prices range from 25 to 30 euros.
in another important company, Andilana, which has 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of this year&#39;s calendar has brought more early bookings since the beginning of November.
&quot;We did the possible and the impossible to keep last year&#39;s prices, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros,&quot; they say.
In the AN Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after seeing an increase in profits since the second half of the year and have relatively solid prospects for Christmas sales.
Sources for the company emphasize that December 18 will also be a busy day, as there will be pre-Christmas celebrations between friends.
they added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they saw a tendency to spend 10% more on guests in exchange for other items such as cava compared to last year.
They also noted that there are already companies that are once again inviting their employees, and the size of the groups seems to be slightly larger.
Fecasarm&#39;s vice president (which includes institutions such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, saying the number of reservations has &quot;recovered&quot;, although clients are &quot;bargaining&quot;.
This impression did not subside even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, he points out.
Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program has caused great unrest in the United States
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons &quot;at a faster rate than any other country.&quot;
Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department published by the Wikileaks portal confirms the extraordinary unrest that is arousing Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and important details they offer regarding the content of the communications and ideas of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states on nuclear safety is &quot;in decline&quot; instead of increasing, and that this an unstable Asian country produces &quot;more nuclear weapons than any other state&quot;.
The peculiarity of Pakistan&#39;s nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled but stored in parts to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington&#39;s vigilance.
This was calculated by Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: &quot;The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of nuclear transport&quot;.
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the missile program is no longer seen only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a spreading and warring cause.
&quot;Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect its nuclear facilities; due to declining levels of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile programs,&quot; said Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev. meeting with their US counterparts.
The biggest novelty in the documentation published by Julian Assange&#39;s server is the ever-lower cooperation between the USA and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the increased pace of Pakistan&#39;s production of these weapons.
A telegram issued by the embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as &quot;frustrating&quot;, states: &quot;Transparency often does not exist; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are rejected.&quot;
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, states that &quot;despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as any other country in the world.&quot;
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to &quot;make it very clear&quot; during the visit of General Ashfaq Kayani, the army&#39;s chief, that &quot;the Pakistani military must end its tacit support for terrorist groups.&quot;
Hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama has appointed a senior counter-terrorism officer to avoid new leaks.
Interpol issues a &quot;red call&quot; to track down and identify where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated maze where it&#39;s hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an &quot;extraordinary call&quot;, the so-called red notice, for &quot;locating and tracking the movement&quot; of Assange.
However, this is not a classic arrest warrant.
In addition, this call is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the recent leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse faced by the Australian in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens assures that &quot;the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assang.&quot;
It was November 20 when the international police force, based in Lyon, France, issued the order at Sweden&#39;s request, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange &quot;in order to impose a temporary detention on him and extradite him&quot;.
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of a person called for a red call, many Member States, as explained by the organization, consider the so-called red notice to allow arrests - this must be done by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral agreement. on the extradition of detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be located.
The move outraged Assenge&#39;s lawyers, who published a paper yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks had shown a willingness to answer questions from the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge applied for and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin&#39;s security.
&quot;This is a hunt and not a legal persecution,&quot; the letter said.
While the whole world is looking for him - and from Australia his mother is defending her son&#39;s innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
on Monday, he gave an interview to Sky&#39;s editor-in-chief via Skype from an unknown location - in this interview, he demanded the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
&quot;If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international conventions that the United States has signed, she should resign,&quot; he said.
His view was rejected yesterday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation demand as &quot;ridiculous and absurd.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website,&quot; he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned Rusell Travers, a senior counter-terrorism officer, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama&#39;s spokesman to stop adding Assange to importance contrasts with the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the Lower House National Security Committee from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks as a terrorist organization, &quot;to intervene and prosecute anyone who would contribute or otherwise assist them. &quot;.
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went even further, saying that Assange should be &quot;killed&quot;, which he subsequently had to recall.
&quot;Obama should reward him or use a drone or something.&quot;
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
&quot;Whoever is in government, who is responsible for the leak, has been betrayed, and any punishment other than execution would be too lenient,&quot; he told Fox Station.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC by &quot;winking&quot; at the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to hold a secret ballot on its stay.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and an end to the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found a recipe for fighting several internal revolts in the ranks of the ERC, unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party&#39;s leader is aware that his gesture of resignation seems to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, and also knows that the influence of the sector is now as weakened as its leader itself, and that he cannot be so worried at all, as he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to gain new criticism by blinking, which will help him to defend himself in the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to speak out secretly about his remaining in office.
Using ballots, not raising your hand.
If Carod&#39;s supporters want to give the president a criminal vote, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid splitting and subjugating his person.
in several interviews he claimed that he would not be considered confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without specifying the percentage, that it would also not be a good result &quot;after Bulgaria&quot;.
Caroda&#39;s supporters demand more from the president than to make his position available - which they see as a gesture that has no weight, as Puigcercós controls the largest body at the conventions.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to enforce resignations, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
For this reason, they expect to participate in the preparation of a document on strategic reorientation, which the management will vote on to the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercós in exchange for this promise to move Congress back in the fall of 2011.
The ERC leader has said that &quot;polyphony&quot; is detrimental to stability and that his goal is for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
in this context, the article that the current consultant Josep Huguet signed on his blog seems to be characteristic.
After considering Puigcercós&#39; ideologue, this innovation adviser took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed &quot;in exchange for several goals.&quot;
And he named five of them, two of whom stand out.
The first is to &quot;recompose&quot; the executive to represent at least 90% of the members, which means including new faces from the Carod-leaning sector.
The second goal can be a big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC completely end the meeting as a functioning mechanism.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates chosen by vote.
Ending the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of Puigcercós&#39;s team, which has fought in this direction at the last two conventions.
However, the 2008 convulsive assembly decided that the meeting must be considered at a special congress on reforms of the statutes.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of this issue.
Now, without lurking critical sectors, it might be a good time to revisit this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 murdered in November; 390 in 2010
According to the daily MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four less than in the previous month, according to the daily MILENIO.
Among the murders, the cases of three women and the finding of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico stand out.
in the penultimate month of the year, there are a total of 390 homicides in Mexico, probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the finding of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a mercy blow to the head, and her arms and legs were tied with a rope.
The next day, the body was found in a suitcase that was stored in the trunk of a vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early in the morning on Thursday, November 4, the co-operatives discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three deadly bullets in the chest off the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report probably signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was murdered by eight shots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two 30-year-old victims were killed by a head shot in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in the district of Ecatepec.
in Chalco, on the remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, the corpse of a man shot in the forehead was found, and a cartridge from a 25th caliber weapon was found under his body.
in Ecatepec, human body parts were found in a sewage canal in the Playa Golondrina colony.
Rescue services made a thorough search for other parts of it, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body with its hands tied back and its head wrapped at the site of Pen Colorado.
The man had a gunshot wound to the nape of his neck.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men was reported, packed in bed linen and left in the trunk of a vehicle in the Villas de la Hacienda in the Atizapán de Zaragoza district, and there were also reports of death threats from the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the Los Reyes district of La Paz.
the rest of the body was found in a nearby colony, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bedding in the village of Zoquiapan in Ixtapaluca County, and the next morning a slain man was found in Huixquilucan wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, who had been identified as Mario Ríos, according to a report left by his killers.
in Ixtapaluca, a woman without signs of life with two wounds to the nape of the nape of her neck was found in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla.
Tattoos of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte were discovered on the woman&#39;s skin, as well as necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, the corpse of a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a report signed by a criminal group was found in a car in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped in tape were found and reported in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said: &quot;This will happen to those who do not adapt.&quot;
in Ecatepec, two bodies were found bearing signs of torture and their limbs tied, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center in the colony of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with tape and with a message; while the other was tortured and found in a plastic container in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Against him, the agents found a message card.
China is pursuing its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
The country&#39;s representative at the UN Climate Change Conference COP16 assured that his country had made extraordinary efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, and said he insisted on his promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020, said Su Wei, the country&#39;s representative at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country had invested $ 245 million over the past four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its goals and would continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He reported that China&#39;s climate change strategy was divided into four areas: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programs.
He has already made progress on all of these points, including last year&#39;s approval of a new energy law that includes proposed targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He further emphasized that in China, federal authorities worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals of energy saving, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, he said, various multi-year plans have been under way or have already been completed, funded by both the Chinese government and other governments.
For example, he said, it is the Energy Efficiency Program, which has been put in place over the last five years and has received investments from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project is also underway, as well as a project to replace fluorescent lamps with energy-saving light bulbs and a mitigation and adaptation project, he specified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country&#39;s climate change expert, assured that China&#39;s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, he described, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are 6 tons, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for a 9% historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the last five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
Legislative expulsion of Espina: César Nava
The national chairman of the PAN party (Partido Acción Nacional) stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to claim his rights from the National Order Commission.
The National Chairman of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been enacted and that the former chairman of the party was entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and demand his rights.
in an interview prior to the objection raised by State Governor Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espina was in any case a decision taken at local level.
&quot;This is an autonomous decision of the Order of the Order in Sonora.&quot;
&quot;Mr. Espino has the right to turn in his case through a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council in order to have it decided by a competent authority,&quot; he added.
He further explained that now was not the time to think about 2012, and that she had never been to the alliance&#39;s presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held on the following December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
&quot;This (alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not yet, it was an intention for local elections that was successful and fulfilled its purpose,&quot; he said.
The chairman of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue are behind him, and therefore &quot;we are not afraid of internal competitiveness, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us&quot;, he added.
He said the committee could, without debate, elect the best chairman the PAN deserved for the next three years, so he would hand over the baton to &quot;who the committee appointed&quot;.
&quot;So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, I will proudly hand over the office of party chairman to any of the five.&quot;
He predicted that the rise in the party&#39;s last election in July would be reflected in future clans, although &quot;there is no time to think about 2012 yet&quot;.
&quot;Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task.&quot;
emphasized in this context that these three governments, which have their roots in the Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloe alliances, will be the flag and subject to observation throughout the country, as &quot;many expectations and aspirations are embedded in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations &quot;.
When we asked him about the critics of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) for his speeches over the four years he rules, César Nava called on PRI members to think about six-year terms. former presidents Ernest Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
&quot;If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Claderon, then let them begin to defend them and let them come out of their shells,&quot; he agreed.
He said the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during a speech at the National Auditorium, as no gagging or censorship is used in the country.
Obama is promoting a law on Twitter to support undocumented students
&quot;If you think the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass the law,&quot; the US president tweeted on a popular social network.
Today, President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents, by posting on his personal Twitter account.
&quot;If you think the approval of the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,&quot; Obama tweeted.
His short report draws attention to an internet link to a more comprehensive document calling on the public to contact the senators immediately as the vote on the bill approaches.
&quot;As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to have your say,&quot; he said.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding was approved.
Such a blockade, announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
When asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other proposals, a presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar could be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
&quot;I believe there is still time left ...&quot;
&quot;We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year ...&quot;
I believe that we will be able to reach an agreement on this matter at some point and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters, &quot;he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would call for a &quot;vote to close the debate&quot; on the Dream Act, so the bill could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, although more likely next week.
Senatorial approval of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have resided in the country in the past five years, and have been accepted into higher education or the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the proposal, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so its supporters&#39; organizations are campaigning intensively to secure the bill.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has expressed his support for the bill.
That is why Dream Act supporters need to get several Republicans in case the other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom the supporters negotiate the most are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as outgoing Florida senator George Lemieux, who completed Senate Mel Martínez&#39;s term.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they said they would not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet commented.
Although the House of Representatives leans towards a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature insert a finger into the wound (&quot;poner el dedo en la llaga&quot;, translated &quot;insert a finger into the wound&quot; is similar to the Czech &quot;hit a nail on the head)
The second round of the Pleasure of Language cycle was a promenade where participants performed a literary gala performance
&quot;I understand that with Sex in Language, but ... Finger to the Wound? What is expected of me?&quot;, Asked the writer Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to begin the second round of Pleasures of Language, a cycle celebrating literature written in Spanish. language, and whose question was used as a subtitle on this occasion (at another trade fair, they addressed the topic of Sex in Language at a round table, she explained).
A finger to the wound &quot;brings us into a tight spot,&quot; the Argentinian writer said kindly to an audience of mostly young people who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair to hear the roundtable debate, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with Valenzuel, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcia Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read a text she dedicated to Gonzalez Celorio, which Schultz then described as a great short story in which Luisa appeared in the first person as the protagonist, who goes from doctor to doctor in search of knowledge of what a &quot;wound&quot; is. the answer though stop the same story yes.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: &quot;patience is not my strong point, maybe it will be my wound&quot;.
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the road, but explained to her that wound was not a scientific term, he was a psychoanalyst who revealed the secret: &quot;wound is really open and the symbolic scar is&quot;.
The protagonist sighed lightly and came to the conclusion that &quot;she only managed to learn so much about the wound that it was really open and that it did not exist&quot;, but she became convinced that pleasures and pitfalls in the tongue must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuel played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also performed an adorable narration, which he called Praise of Invention, in which a finger is not named in the wound, but at one point it appears.
with elements of magical realism tells of a famous witch who played clouds, brought back people who had gone far, or corrected the honesty lost by a virgin, this story, which was then turned to speak America, a great novel in which they were not missing from the beginning his own chroniclers who narrated it, and Bernal Díaz del Castillo is quoted here as criticizing exaggeration in the narration of the conquering captains.
&quot;Cervantes, who invented us all (the writers), was ridiculed by the fake testimony that was presented as real in the stories, but in another way he never managed to tell the story of America with such imagination that even lacked shame.&quot;
However, he stressed, &quot;they are fools and liars who have more imagination&quot; and it is precisely where reality and lie merge, where it is no longer known which of the story belongs to one group and what belongs to another, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
He really calls it the &quot;Cervant tradition.&quot;
&quot;Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have.&quot;
Subsequently, Mayra Monterová emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her discussion Finger to the Wound made possible.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican writer has pointed with her finger at the great blow of social violence that runs through her country - and is shared by Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
&quot;I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a silent compromise, which of course is not intended,&quot; she said after saying that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of compromise that is formed between the author and readers - and in their &quot; chemical reaction &quot;.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized &quot;this finger to the wound of a writer bound by the writer&quot;.
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, as well as in intellectual habits and control of consciousness overflowing with dogmatism, one forgets &quot;that there is a small no behind every nod and a small yes behind every denial.&quot;
&quot;To be masters of our thoughts and realities, we must color: and coloring means putting a finger many times in the wound and harassing those who are much more comfortable because they think in cartoons, black and white, fixed ideas and without coloring, and also harassing authorities who prefer this black and white world, &quot;he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano follows his first title
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he has already managed to achieve a decisive series on three occasions.
in the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition, two different styles will meet, characterized by their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, he has experienced good and bad during his career, but he was able to achieve a decisive series on three occasions, but until now he left with an untaken one, which is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, stayed one step behind the winners and curiously played the same final with the same team.
The Santistic strategist reached his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament as a coach, when he had the reins of the Morelia club, with which he lost a total of 4-2 against Toluca; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament he advanced to the decisive duel again and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna in the Torneo Bicentenario 2010 tournament, again against the &quot;Devils&quot; of Toluka, Rubén suffered a defeat again, although his team played against the &quot;Smokers&quot; (another nickname of the Deportivo Toluca club) after 210 minutes of play draw 2 -2, after a series of penalty shots, he got a three-on-one advantage and had two opportunities to seal the title, but in the end his three players missed from 11 steps and the team suffered a turnaround to 4-3.
Ruben has already lost two finals against the &quot;Red Devils&quot; of Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse and celebrate the title for the first time, although he says the institution is most important to him.
&quot;I want to be the winner, I don&#39;t want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I am committed to, and the title would be for me, of course, but the first one is the most important,&quot; the coach said when asked about numbers that speak in the final against him.
he has a vivid memory of the previous final, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, &quot;we learned the lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we can not celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as players, because last time with two penalties, we they were ready to run out to celebrate, and I think we learned that in this until the match is over, we can&#39;t celebrate. &quot;
He is not worried that this series could decide in penalty shots, he believes his players: &quot;You never try to make a series of penalty kicks, you try to end in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you have to be prepared for it, in the past we were ready for the tournament, but unfortunately fate prepared us for a bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or anxiety we felt when the title was in our hands, but we lost it, it left something in us and hopefully something like this will not happen this time &quot; .
In his hands, Romano has a chance to stop being the other and taste the fame of the titles for the first time.
The United States is changing the rules for issuing visas
People will have to contact the Visa Applicant Service Centers before being interviewed at the Consular Section; costs will be lower and waiting times will be reduced.
From January 10, 2011, the visa negotiation process at the US Embassy and consulates will change.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centers (ASC) before being interviewed by the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant&#39;s biometric information and this will be assessed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, you will no longer have to pay a fee for arranging a meeting, the second for processing the application and another for delivering the document by the transport service.
The applicant pays only one fee, which covers all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $ 140 for a tourist visa, $ 150 for visas with an application (including visas for temporary workers) and $ 390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to interview the consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC to present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who require a second meeting with an interview at the Consular Section will spend less time there than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for a visa at consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra $ 26 service fee.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The US space agency convened a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a turning point in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm a theory about the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 pm by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA&#39;s Washington headquarters.
When she invited journalists, NASA assured that she would present a &quot;discovery that will cause a turning point in the search for extraterrestrial life,&quot; which has sparked speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and that could present the possibility of one day becoming intelligent creatures, such as humans, if conditions improve, in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemist National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life because the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere of Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that &quot;there is another, second form of life, different from the one we know.&quot;
The space agency will announce the real impact of the discoveries at tomorrow&#39;s press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn&#39;s largest moon) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patrón breed the opposition &quot;bloc&quot;
Reforms to the Constitutional Law on Congress are leading to the advent of &quot;bipartism,&quot; they say.
The 60th parliamentary term had not yet begun when an opposition bloc was formed in Congress, led by members of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática), PT (Partido del Trabajo, in Czech &quot; Convergencia, Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four discussed one thing: the arrival of &quot;bipartism&quot; in the House.
Before the start of the 60th parliamentary session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of the Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo &quot;thundered&quot; against the reform of the Constitutional Law as it rejected them.
With this reform, they repeated, &quot;Baptism&quot; begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
The four MEPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the PAN-led Council of Salvador López Briton and the Partis Acción and Luis Cárdenas Fonseca. as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally constitute political marginality at the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, in Czech &quot;Revolutionary Institutional Party&quot;) and the PAN.
He specified that in the coming days they would talk to representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they did not, they would be subjugated by the two parties again, ending the opposition coalition.
&quot;When it came here (the opposition coalition), I look at it, because we are excluded from any decision, they are not even willing to consider the opinion of others.&quot;
Convergencia&#39;s Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez said that they agreed with the PRD, PT and Patrón and would therefore form a pluralist group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, was now &quot;duopole.&quot;
The aspiration of law reform is not to have endless bipartism in Congress.
The group starts with five legislators and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
PT&#39;s Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza explained that Congress has now become the &quot;prey&quot; of the two - alluding to the PAN and PRI parties.
&quot;It used to be controlled by only one party, today it is divided by two.&quot;
Patron Montalvo asked that the Member&#39;s personality be respected and that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
&quot;So that the five Members, who are probably already nine, but are seeing us at five right now, are not left out, each in a different faction due to the vaulted agreements, we have united to find a seat at the negotiating table, as the problem is that reform, which we have formed and agreed, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform &quot;.
Another 200,000 pesos issued for &quot;supplier&quot;
Mazatlán City Hall will pay another check to the discussed owner of the company supplying the electrical material.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by City Hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
As a result, the amount paid in the second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying electrical materials will climb to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the City Hall&#39;s transparency page, this last check, number 9258447, was sent on 16 November this year, issued for 200,144.56 pesos and referred to as &quot;settlement of outstanding payments&quot;.
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay an additional amount to this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for sales at high prices.
What has not been said is the total amount that City Hall still owes her, and how many checks will still be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
&quot;Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe her, as well as other suppliers, is paid for it,&quot; he said in an interview.
The last checks &quot;reappeared&quot; in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last on November 16.
Although the businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as required by law in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office to prevent their services from being used by other administrations, the treasurer assured that the town hall had not used the contractor&#39;s services again.
Earlier, after July 25, Noroeste published a revision of checks issued by City Hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city paid more than 10 years to Camach Palazuelos. million pesos through 42 checks.
She also executed transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites are in dire need of maintenance
Tourist managers are complaining about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Sánchez Taboada pavilion in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist into a depression in Sánchez Taboada&#39;s pavilion, the Mazatlán tourism sector is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and thus not showing the port in a good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Association of Merchants, recalled that they had repeatedly called for the impression of the destination to be taken into account, and for the bad things tourists find here to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk here and see clutter, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
&quot;Politicians don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea what revenue is leaking, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be dealing with these issues for so long and without proper planning.&quot;
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
&quot;City Hall will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, it will have to pay attention to preventive maintenance, not just to repair existing defects,&quot; he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because as residents we deserve a clean residence, the town hall should change its strategy for maintaining the city &quot;.
There are other places that look neglected and miserable, he noted, such as the Emblem of Mazatlan and El Venadito (monument, deer statue).
&quot;Nowadays, in order for tourists to come, it is not just a matter of promotion, we need to offer a good product, a city abounding in the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out,&quot; he said.
&quot;The necessary attention has not been paid here and these facts emphasize something that is well known to all, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, saying that the priority must be to keep the city clean and tidy in order to be attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, sub-secretary of the Tourist Graduation, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlán is urgent, as they are not used properly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and spaces, which will first need to be put in order to make these places more attractive and to be included in the list we have for promoting this destination. &quot;
The IP is asking Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, would like MPs to take on a great responsibility by leading by example in the search for a better Sinaloy, in the various challenges facing the state.
A parliamentary period full of decent work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive is demanding the business sector in Mazatlán, because Sinaloa is in convulsions and is facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term has begun, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI members, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia and the last from the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from new members of Congress is that they be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same party and paternalistic patrons will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), suggested that the recently elected 40 members of Congress take on a great deal of responsibility and lead by example on the road to a better Sinaloou in the various challenges they face.
&quot;We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to advance their own interests and become carnival processions of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.&quot;
He therefore spoke of the need to reaffirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridging that would move the ruling forward in turn.
&quot;We want them to do a decent job and, above all, to society and the sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloy who put their trust in them in the last election.&quot;
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for the 40 national representatives would be to gather all his efforts to achieve the country&#39;s economic growth, as the current economic situation is very difficult.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will in some way support job creation &quot;.
As for tourism, he called for the new legislators to give it more weight in the state budget and to support the Ministry of Tourism.
&quot;I learned that it is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currency and investment, which, moreover, directly competes with agriculture.&quot;
In addition to spending funds on start-up tourism projects, Congress should help provide the state with security and assistance with the Alcohol Act, which has not been resolved in previous parliamentary terms.
The Three Kings are being sought
Dolls, toy cars and bicycles, along with other toys, are on the wish list of children in the Coronado Valenzuel family.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their dreams of the coming Feast of the Three Kings, as their household numbers exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kašpar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they long for.
The family lives in poor housing in Colonia Salvador Allende, as the father does not have a permanent job.
&quot;Sometimes we have a hard time because my husband is unlucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes ... In the afternoon I go out on the street with &#39;plebeians&#39; to sell on the street,&quot; said Cayetana Valenzuel, Andrade, mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a &quot;monster&quot; car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana would like to be dressed for one year.
&quot;He told me (José Alfredo) &#39;I wish this monster car&#39;, but I told him &#39;we&#39;ll see a son&#39; because it was very expensive,&quot; he recalls with Cayetana&#39;s sadness.
Clothes and shoes would be ideal for older children who were just in school.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is 12, ten-year-old Isaías is 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so a pair of five and a half or six would suit him.
To help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuel family, you can take part in the &quot;Looking for the Three Kings&quot; campaign and bring a gift or cash at the reception of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of a network for the production and sale of Indian hemp.
Fourteen people have been arrested and are facing various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrook, Orford and Stoke, mostly in drug production sites.
&quot;Approximately 750 beds of Indian hemp, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used to produce it were confiscated,&quot; said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom were alleged bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrook.
The arrested persons had to report to the Sherbrook Palace of Justice following their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, possessing it for the purpose of trafficking it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These inspections took place after a long investigation, which lasted almost a year.
&quot;It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests,&quot; said M. Ruel.
The police operation was attended by 70 police officers from the Regional Investigation Unit of the City of Estria of the Quebec State Police, the Sherbrook State Police and the Sherbrook Memphrémagog Police.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
The Conservatives&#39; bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded with illegal immigrants, will obviously be overcome, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday that they could not support it.
&quot;I rely heavily on the Charter.&quot;
&quot;I stand upright on the side of the party that has built granite under your feet,&quot; said Liberal chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a weekly session of the weekly du caucus.
Liberals insist that a bill, as proposed, a law that would allow for the detention of up to one year any person from a ship identified as carrying an illegal immigrant would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was heading for the wrong goal.
&quot;We are against and all opposition parties seem to be against, so we will see what the government does,&quot; said M. Duceppe.
Olivia Chow, an NPD critic on the issue of immigration, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
&quot;The neo-democrats agree that we should take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be the mainstay of another bill, C-35,&quot; Ms Chow said.
&quot;We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and places children in prison for at least a year,&quot; Ms Chow explained.
Immigration Secretary Jason Kenney has accused opposition parties.
&quot;Canadians are telling MPs en masse that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that are targeting Canada and treating it like a pathologist.&quot;
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney said.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative told QMI that the government would ask for a vote so that any deputy who opposed would answer for his position in front of his constituents.
New unity does not mean unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and anti-collision unit, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public commission of inquiry into the issue.
The Minister for Public Security, Robert Dutil, is working to ensure that this idea is not forgotten: Québec intends to consult with the New York Department of Investigation in January next year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit at its disposal since 1870.
That&#39;s why Tuesday&#39;s announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Council for Police Services in Quebec on October 29 last year, this measure was not discussed, despite the fact that Robert Dutil himself was present.
It was no longer necessary for PQ critic Stéphane Bergeron, a public safety critic, to rate the announcement as &quot;a rabbit taken out of a hat&quot; and &quot;an amateur solution stuffed on the knee.&quot;
Minister Dutil himself has responded to those who fear that political power has too much of an impact on the possible future of unity.
&quot;Satisfied with the confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it.&quot;
&quot;We are aware of this problem.&quot;
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is no substitute for setting up witnesses to be heard during a public hearing.
&quot;In addition, Mr. Charest confirms that he does not want to create this commission of inquiry, and people, like you and me, think he is hiding something,&quot; he explains.
&quot;The only way to create a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest,&quot; explains Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Training of Senior Civil Servants.
In order to emerge from this impasse, he suggested that Quebec grant a special authorization to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
&quot;We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General,&quot; he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners, who are allowed to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the files of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to make it better suited for this type of crime.
This request would be based on Operation Marteau (Hammer), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law on this type of investigation was not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently discussing some of the amendments related to this dossier.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently had changes made to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several watercourses have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall, which has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
A landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road is bent.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, ie it rained from 40 to 70 millimeters.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters was not expected from today until Thursday evening, depending on the region.
Sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were hardest hit.
A total of up to 100 millimeters could fall there.
If we add these precipitation to the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we can fear floods in some watercourses.
The Quebec Rescue Service issued a flood warning Wednesday night for the dangers of the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in les Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of flood preparedness and continuous monitoring.
In the area of Lanaudière, heavy rainfall caused the flooding of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the outpouring of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The ambulance service is on call and overseeing the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Center issued warnings of severe floods on Wednesday for several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont was partially embarrassed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as rude statements during broadcasting.
The Broadcasting Council considers that Mr Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM group had the right to express their views, but some statements contained &quot;inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians.&quot; &quot;.
The Council also concluded that discussions on suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two people who had taken their lives, did not violate radio broadcasting regulations.
The Broadcasting Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken following a complaint from the Joint Front of Quebec Social Beneficiaries.
The group complained that the amounts reported were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not misleading information.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report was such that suicide could not be seen as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
&quot;The majority of the Commission considers that the disputed episodes of the&quot; Dupont Noon &quot;broadcasts have run into a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner.&quot;
No allegations were made against him.
The latest controversy concerned statements following the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort embarked on a media shootout that provoked many reactions.
The CHOI moderator said he did not send any donations to help the Haitians, because we cannot know for sure that the needy will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unwarranted, but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative image of Haitians.
&quot;I&#39;ve already undone my three-day adjournment.&quot;
&quot;My file has been intact for a year and a half,&quot; the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use harsh expression in broadcasting.
In any case, CHOI-FM cooperated &quot;beyond its responsibilities&quot;.
For a station that will have to announce these decisions, among other things, once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of the kung-fuvà of Montreal.
A resident of Montreal, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special run.
An athlete who excels in &quot;sand&quot; (kung fu &quot;full contact&quot;), kickboxing and Thai boxing, he enters tatami and rings around the world and looks for new challenges.
&quot;I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who has lived in the capital since 2008 to study with professionals.&quot;
&quot;In my case, I&#39;m looking for matches a bit everywhere, because for those who don&#39;t like the ground game that comes with martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.&quot;
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and assistant for UPS, just gave bad news to his opponents when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, in Scotland.
&quot;I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,&quot; he said.
&quot;I am currently preparing for China for the World Cup in san shou.&quot;
&quot;Opponents were invited to finish in the top four at the last World Cup in each category.&quot;
&quot;I won bronze in Toronto in 2009.&quot;
&quot;I finished eighth in 2005 in Vietnam.&quot;
&quot;In 2007, I finished fifth in the tournament in China, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009, he added.&quot;
&quot;Interestingly, I&#39;ve made some progress in every competition.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll be at this pace for the first time this year or next year!&quot;
&quot;san shou&quot; or &quot;sanda&quot; is a discipline originating in China, where punches and feet, as well as throwing to the ground, are allowed.
The matches take place traditionally on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, arising from this form of fighting, is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal is to maintain only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the &quot;King of Sanda&quot; super tournament, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
&quot;This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,&quot; explains the nice guy. &quot;
&quot;It&#39;s kind of the equivalent of Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand).&quot;
&quot;It was a great experience.&quot;
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the finals.
&quot;The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed.&quot;
&quot;There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).&quot;
&quot;The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the finals of their category.&quot;
&quot;Then the winners of each category will compete so that the only champion, the king of kung fu, can be crowned.&quot;
450 contracted millions without public tenders
Hydro-Québec has agreed by mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is the consortium of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that has won the most important contract, a $ 295 million contract to manage the entire project without a tender.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was mandated in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this major $ 5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the &quot;Énergie gérance&quot; consortium won a lucrative contract without any call for tenders.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against a consortium of companies poses a serious ethical problem, which risks the elimination of competition and causes price increases.
&quot;It&#39;s a new way to collide and eliminate competition.&quot;
&quot;This means that people who no longer make side agreements in secret, today they do so openly,&quot; PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard asked the National Assembly this question because he said it was difficult to see how the public interest could be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon, vehemently denying that the contract was a collusion.
&quot;I have my own way,&quot; she thundered, claiming that PQ was &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;lacked precision.&quot;
She said &quot;it would be the least&quot; that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for forming a consortium is a common practice around the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex given the scale of the work.
The construction is already underway and must be scheduled for 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; it was a business.
It must also be acknowledged that the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula for engineering consulting consortia is under investigation by the government.
If we fly through the business register of Quebec companies in a hurry, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created permanently.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; let&#39;s name CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau emphasized in particular the fact that &quot;the territory of la Baie James is characterized by a special dynamics of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s&quot;.
The main patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that would force us to frown at the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
&quot;If you go to a public tender and there are few bidders bidding, your bids may be higher.&quot;
&quot;You have two options: that is, to pick up the people who figure in the contract as participants in the competition, and to say, &#39;Let&#39;s make a satisfactory agreement at a good price.&#39;
&quot;But the main idea is that it is not the price that matters, but the competence of the people,&quot; Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract, awarded to the Énergie Gérance consortium, is part of a long list of more than $ 50,000 contracts received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out analyzes of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin grabbed 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without a share in &quot;Énergie gérance&quot;.
All contracts were concluded.
They total $ 449,783,344, including a contract with Énergie gérance for $ 295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard indicated that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are &quot;very well known Liberal parties in Quebec&quot;.
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ is also associated with the companies that &quot;finance&quot; it, before specifying that it is more of its executives.
Barometer of responsible consumption - &quot;green&quot; label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in &quot;impartial&quot; labels and eco-certificates, to be guided accordingly when choosing products.
The worst thing is that even if we bathe in a media universe that urges us to encourage more socially responsible consumption, this media universe laments the lack of credible information, a failure that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, Baromètre says of responsible consumption. whose first article was published yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers trying to sell them still do not trust them
In fact, two-thirds of us say we don&#39;t trust companies&#39; environmental promises, simply because green advertising by companies finds a measuring tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke&#39;s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of official certificates affixed to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labeled as environmentally responsible, says Barometre.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be paramount in stimulating this aspect of consumption, which is currently being revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of the information would dampen the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
After all, a third of Quebecs are distrustful of the information about the products or &quot;green&quot; services we are looking for to pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products in response to their beliefs.
As many as 61% of them preferred shopping at merchants in their neighborhood and preferred to buy food grown in their region, Baromètre said.
More &quot;green&quot; and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 this year - Homo consumus Québeku likes to present itself as the king of recycling, striving to minimize the impact on the environment by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience obviously remained outside their car, Baromètre said: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebec residents said they used public transport or recommended using a car to drive at least two people to protect nature.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this large-scale behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have applied for financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallèle, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
The developer company &quot;Angus et le Parallèle&quot;, which sought a $ 7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy the cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent and proved its mission as a film lover, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the Quebec government is proposing a lower loan, some were the original expectations that could lay the foundations for a viable solution on favorable terms and with resources from the state.
The first action plan and the 12.8 million request were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but the applications have already been revised for reduction.
The proposal and action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by François Macerola, President of the Society for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Culture (SODEC), which manages the eXcentris cinema project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government&#39;s counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema and Cinema Center Owners in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the purchase of eXcentris, concluding that the Minister of Culture should not fund a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the debate called for substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got film art into his cinema premises within ten years after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the change by the state financial council.
The lack of theaters for independent films is flashy in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to gain a regular clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, is running a campaign to release funds to the private sector, believing it will raise $ 700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future acquirers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and screen Xavier Beauvois&#39; most beautiful film Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir, so he ignores him and his group thinks of the reduction proposals being made to him.
The curtain raised on Canada as a whole ...
New diplomatic American sources made known through WikiLeaks reveal what the United States sees as a complex of Canadians&#39; inferiority over Americans, but with the same blow they reveal their sense of superiority over Canada.
U.S. diplomats are therefore surprised that Canadian-American relations are at the heart of every Canadian electorate when it comes to voting, and believe that President Obama&#39;s visit helped the Conservative government adopt its 2009 budget!
four new reports, including the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington, yesterday, showcased the public, providing sensitive details to get under the skin.
A communication dated September 22, 2008, ie in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
&quot;Canada&#39;s inferiority complex, almost stagnant, makes possible political leaders talk about internal betting instead of realizing that the election also affects the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),&quot; he writes.
&quot;So the United States is,&quot; he concluded, &quot;a proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous but potentially too threatening to talk about.&quot;
The ambassador understands this &quot;deafening silence&quot; all the less because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
&quot;It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party, or better yet a party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters keep in mind when going to the polls.&quot;
Another statement of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d&#39;Affaires of Ottawa to Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
&quot;Your journey will help ensure that the government is maintained in a vote of confidence in early February over the federal budget, which Canada will publicly grant its first deficit in more than a decade, for a $ 30-40 billion recovery plan,&quot; Breese said.
Nowhere is there any mention that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of parliament in order not to be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, highlights Washington&#39;s increasingly negative image of dramatic CBC series on the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O broadcasts, in which not very subtle references to Maher Arar, the &quot;No-Fly-List&quot; or also abductions for violent interrogations by the CIA can be observed.
Another report reports that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner, Bernard Kouchner, if Europe was ready to receive some Guantanamo detainees.
Mr Kouchner answered yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, &quot;he handed over a piece of paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian descent, to the Secretary of State.&quot;
&quot;The secretary accepted by revising the file.&quot;
Finally, note that the people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be &quot;destroyed.&quot;
It was announced, and Mike Huckabee in the United States heard about it.
World Plan for Lighting Restoration
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancún a plan to restore home lighting, shop lighting and industrial space in 100 countries to reduce the greenhouse effect (GES), which is close to one-third of the further reduction needed to stabilize the planet&#39;s climate from now until 2020. ..
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to push through in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult-to-implement reduction commitments on the part of industrialized countries.
According to yesterday&#39;s plan, if incandescent bulbs, which monopolize another 50 to 70% of the market, are replaced by fluorescent light bulbs or, even better, light bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or &quot;LED&quot; in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tons (Gt ) GES emissions from the planet due to lighting would be eliminated.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the world&#39;s car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with significant emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have joined voluntary reduction plans to reduce global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But another 5 Gt will have to be deducted from this balance in order to stabilize the climate heating at 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to rule out getting out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, ie 5%, is the product of light.
With fluff compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, and with new bulbs with DEL, we reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluorescent light bulbs last on average from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, launched by Philips this week - the company reportedly participated in a UN study - have an expected lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a glowing bulb, giving us an idea of the potential savings. with a compensation plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collection points.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a light-compact light bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants, which emit much of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these headquarters circulate 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also details the benefits that each country would make from this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save $ 1 billion a year on electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 billion power plants, which would cost $ 2.5 billion to build.
Côte d&#39;Ivoire is eagerly awaiting the results of the election results.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the immediate publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d&#39;Ivoire after the deadlines.
&quot;The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the preliminary results without delay, a spokesman for the UN President emphasized.&quot;
&quot;It calls on all parties in Côte d&#39;Ivoire and the institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results have been announced.&quot;
Despite pressures from some foreign governments, the election commission allowed the deadline to expire - midnight on Wednesday - without publishing the results, three days after Sunday&#39;s scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission was &quot;continuing its work&quot; to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were calls around the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the annulment of the Constitutional Council for &quot;fraudulent&quot; voting in the north, run by former New Army (FN) insurgents since the failed September 2002 coup.
Pascal Affi N&#39;Guessan, director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d&#39;Ivoire, confirmed that maneuvers of intimidation carried out by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country had discouraged Côte d&#39;Ivoire supporters from going to the polls.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints made by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country&#39;s supreme court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N&#39;Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as &quot;unacceptable&quot; and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of presidential elections, which took place on Sunday, was seen as the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided in two halves for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned Côte d&#39;Ivoire&#39;s political faction that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on October 31, as the winner with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remains stable in the third quarter.
According to the International Labor Office (BIT), the unemployment rate in France remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas), as shown by interim seasonally adjusted data (CVS) data released on Thursday. INSEE.
The number of unemployed has stabilized at 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7%, including overseas territories.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 point.
In a broader sense, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, whether or not they are available in two weeks to work, and regardless of whether they work looking for or not looking for.
The situation of current young people in the labor market has been exacerbated with a new increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas territories.
According to the International Labor Office, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were out of work in the third quarter.
As for the elderly, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, the same as a year), ie 482,000 people aged 50 and over and 6.6 % including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 benefited from unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Insee has not published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after controversy over its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union&#39;s statistical agency, on the other hand, continues to compile monthly statistics, reporting a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) on Tuesday, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste treatment companies and the brother of the PS of the Bouches-du-Rhône Board of Directors, was charged and imprisoned in Luynes Prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in a public procurement investigation obtained.
Alexandre Guérini has been accused of misusing company property, misusing public funds and public property, concealing, giving bribes, accepting bribes to influence the office and holding ammunition, according to his lawyer.
&quot;Alexandre Guérini is militant and insists that he explain to the judge all the questions he intends to ask him, not any delusions.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s easy to pursue him for many reprehensible reasons, but it&#39;s another thing to prove them,&quot; his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning his client.
Mr Guérini, through his lawyers, stated that he had sent a brief statement to the judge before his interrogation in order to explain everything.
One of his loved ones, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client had never done anything other than keep the landfills he was supposed to run.
He never knew anything about the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, Mr Simon said.
In the matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of the Aubagne services, was accused on Wednesday of misusing public funds and conspiracies, and left free, under judicial supervision with a ban on contact, the protagonists of the whole affair.
&quot;My client was able to explain all the facts he was accused of.&quot;
&quot;The investigating judge is taking this into account and will leave him free,&quot; said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released on Tuesday night Wednesday, under judicial supervision over two of them, said Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy General Manager with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for taking bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption. &quot;
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are accused, one of &quot;theft and misuse of company property&quot;, the other of &quot;conspiracy to misuse public funds.&quot;
Finally, Alexandra Guérini&#39;s business partner, Jeannie Peretti, has been accused of &quot;concealing misuse of company property.&quot;
Among those confronted with Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company of helping to launder money from large-scale gangsterism.
The investigation is being conducted in several open court investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged procurement fraud, in particular in the field of waste.
From a source of close investigation, the search focuses mainly on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the municipal community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: The Elysee Palace exaggerated Syria&#39;s mediation
For more than a decade, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for &quot;espionage&quot;, united views in France, put diplomacy on alert and highlighted relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this is closely watched by diplomats from the United States.
US documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostages in Iran (a small group of tourists).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman was not a compensation for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the US judiciary for smuggling in material material for Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
Finally, they shed light on the way in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he did nothing about it.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the headline: &quot;Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages&quot;.
Adviser from the Elysee Palace on Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Quai d&#39;Orsay Director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with Allegrone, a representative of American diplomacy.
They explain the French method to him.
They are urging Americans to do just as much to get their own nationals back to their homeland forcibly detained in Iran.
&quot;Make noise,&quot; they say, &quot;constantly utter emphatically&quot; in the media the words &quot;fundamental human rights,&quot; &quot;innocence,&quot; &quot;immediate deliverance.&quot;
The Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, needs to be put in trouble.
&quot;The more you do, the more they ask you to stop.&quot;
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discrete channels, &quot;silence will not solve anything,&quot; Iranians are &quot;masters of evasive maneuvers.&quot;
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is an &quot;Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for&quot; political blackmail &quot;.
He announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on 16 August, the day the French embassy will take refuge) &quot;will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians&quot; (bail 230,000 euros).
And he announces that the Elysee Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that will &quot;escalate.&quot;
The Iranians could &quot;arrest about 1,800 more French people living in Iran in the future,&quot; he said.
August 28, 2009
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: Majid Kakavand of Iran, who the United States claims has been deported for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material in relation to Iran, is released in Paris by a judge&#39;s decision.
The US Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material for its nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France entered into bargaining?
Liberation of an Iranian for the liberation of a young Frenchwoman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee Palace, he says, was not only &quot;surprised by the judge&#39;s decision,&quot; but was looking for a way to oppose it.
&quot;There have been talks between the presidency and the Minister of Justice&quot; (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but &quot;the French government cannot change the court&#39;s decision,&quot; he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under &quot;limited&quot; supervision by the French intelligence service.
An Elysee Palace adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs a U.S. diplomat that the Iranian is currently in Parisian buildings run by the Iranian embassy.
At the time of Klotilda Reiss&#39;s imprisonment in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communiqués and organized &quot;escapes&quot; to the media, to convince Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad of playing a &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;influential&quot; role as a &quot;mediator.&quot;
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and state that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media &quot;blush&quot; of French officials.
The embassy in Paris asks what such a degree of &quot;gratitude&quot; is based on M. Assad.
&quot;Despite their statements full of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did.&quot;
The documentary then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysee Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication &quot;aims to validate President Sarkozy&#39;s policy of opening up to Syria,&quot; he analyzes.
The policy pursued in 2008 &quot;was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and described as premature and undeserved&quot;.
By &quot;exaggerating the Syrian role,&quot; Paris seeks to &quot;demonstrate to Syria what praise it can earn when it plays a constructive role in the region.&quot;
The goal is also to &quot;sow the grain of strife between Syria and Iran.&quot;
The US Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier confided to him: &quot;of course we do not know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is&quot;
&quot;But we still thanked them.&quot;
&quot;It should at least bring confusion and ambiguity among Iranians.&quot;
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysee Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their &quot;active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot&quot;.
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called &quot;Pecival&quot; that will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to the gaming after midnight for people under the age of 16, officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of the Family said.
&quot;Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day.&quot;
&quot;We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,&quot; Jo Rin, a senior ministry official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be newly available from 6 am.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents ask for it, the responsible official added.
It will also make free programs available to people who request it, allowing them to reduce their time online.
South Korea is one of the countries most &quot;affected&quot; and the daily press regularly brings various facts related to the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, in the face of 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Cup: Fifa establishes host countries.
Fifa&#39;s executive committee on Thursday, hosted the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts on Thursday, a supremely politically motivated choice, where the struggle for influence and lobbying run the risk of exceeding technical criteria, is full of unrest over suspected corruption.
The thing is for sure, the Fifa royal competition in 2018 will take place in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue deploying to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Africa). Korea).
The list of personalities who will take part in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, senior government officials in Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an idea of scale of economic and political betting around the world.
Behind-the-scenes negotiations run the risk of lasting until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to Fifa&#39;s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documentation contains the best arguments, as do the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not carry too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour of voting.
At the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of CE / European Commission? / For corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), the Sunday Times may have ruined its country&#39;s chances, the cradle of football, which has so far hosted the World Cup only once a year.
The BBC put the crown on Monday when it aired a document that &quot;pinned&quot; three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make Fifa dissatisfied and get into trouble with English leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
The prime minister hopes to repeat the move made by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who won the London 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intensive activity be enough for England to give a new shine to its name at CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal pair does not lack the trumps of already prepared stadiums, their greetings (World Championships in 1982 in Spain, Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Possible retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move the championship to Zurich and publicly declared &quot;unfair competition in the preparation of the vote&quot;, in verbal allusions barely twisted to accusations of the English press against members of the CE (European Commission).
&quot;We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them,&quot; Mr Poutin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be the logical favorite with its considerable 1994 experience.
The highest performing economy in the world, home to Fifa&#39;s main sponsors, seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for both countries, which together passed the &quot;test&quot; in 2002.
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa eagerly desires, has invalidated Asia&#39;s 2022 chances.
With Qatar pulling a big ace up its sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue to expand into new countries, but the two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pay for the poor TV fees (due to time lag) paid by European countries, creating a driving force for Fifa.
Second mandate: clarity
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand gave the impression that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
The mandate of the Elysee Palace is to call someone else.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of secrecy associated with the presidency.
It is therefore necessary to act as if doubts persist.
In one sense and the other.
In 2006, without being believed, Jacques Chirac&#39;s friends claimed that the third term would not be ruled out.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that &quot;he will decide sometime in the autumn of 2011&quot;.
As he reminds in front of members of the UMP parliament on Wednesday evening at the Elysee Palace, the prospect of &quot;two seats&quot; has sown a little feverish.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He was not far from it.
The President merely recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not an announcement.
This is not the first time that such meetings have been reminiscent of the presidential election in a humorous tone.
&quot;In the worst case, or at best, you still have seven and a half years ahead of me,&quot; he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: &quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m not considering the next stage.&quot;
His statements yesterday will not make him a candidate more than the day before; it will not make him a candidate or less.
If they evoke comments, it is because of a double truth.
Speeding up the path to candidacy for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the entrance to Ségolèn Royal&#39;s battlefield that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is evident that many in the PS want premature rather than intended arrangements.
Bad research on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon&#39;s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy&#39;s candidacy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L&#39;Express).
&quot;We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP,&quot; people from the Prime Minister&#39;s immediate vicinity responded immediately and cautiously.
&quot;If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run,&quot; says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
&quot;He will still believe he can win,&quot; corrects Alain Juppé, balanced with obviousness.
Euro: European Central Bank forced to continue its purchases of government securities.
The last meeting of the Central Governing Council in the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for exit from the crisis or, at the very least, to announce the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European debt is binding, the institute for issuing securities will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation already so tense in European securities markets.
In such a case, the political price would be all the higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in resolving the debt crisis in European countries.
She did not want to say if she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
&quot;I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...)&quot;.
The evening before, in Brussels, during the hearing of the European Parliament&#39;s Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissions, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not prove to be more eloquent about his intentions and contented himself with stating that the program of buying state titles on the secondary market &quot;continues&quot; and that &quot;we will see how we decide&quot; during the meeting, which takes place this Thursday.
The only certainty: the European Central Bank will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, purchases of bonds from the treasury by the European Central Bank have doubled in the last week to almost 1.35 billion euros.
And thanks to the irrationality of the market negotiators, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have bought up € 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market players, anticipations about the continuation of purchases leave no doubt (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change in the exchange rate.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, the latter proceeds with the unrestricted provision of liquidity on generous terms and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
&quot;I can&#39;t imagine it changing its program significantly.&quot;
&quot;If not, it would take the risk of creating short-term new tensions,&quot; said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
&quot;The progressive approach announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,&quot; predicts Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To the plan of its interventions in the public debt market, &quot;the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the weak market,&quot; adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, it has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
&quot;It needs to make up for the shortage of investors in the market at all costs and to act in such a way as to prevent the outburst of paid performances by countries that are among the most fragile,&quot; a prominent bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, states will be all the more worried about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It is saving the euro at this price.
In Italy, Berlusconi&#39;s government is hunched over
After the start of the week for Italy, the worrying situation eased a bit, yesterday with a return flow of bond interest to 10 years.
Return to temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of the regions said that they had heard Giulio Tremonti classifying the situation as &quot;unsolvable&quot; and that he was expecting an &quot;unpredictable&quot; weekend, which he then denied.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from long German interest rates reached a record 210 basis points and the price of CDS contracts soared to 263 points, causing some upset in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was &quot;too busy&quot; with &quot;turbulent market developments&quot; and a possible contagion originating in Ireland.
&quot;The good news is that Italy, the eurozone&#39;s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.&quot;
&quot;The bad news is he&#39;s like Portugal,&quot; explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and weak fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes the state to the risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels&#39; latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 ... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the general government deficit will still represent 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new set of amendments to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, amounting to 7 billion euros.
&quot;If necessary, new stringent measures will have to be taken,&quot; said Economic Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
&quot;The cornerstones of its economy are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been saying this for a long time,&quot; says Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the board of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy for the International Monetary Fund.
&quot;There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization effort required in Italy is less than the effort required of other countries,&quot; notes Pier Carlo. Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure on the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections scheduled for the end of March could begin.
This would start a period unsuitable for taking a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking of strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this at a press conference in Paris yesterday: &quot;I think Europeans demonstrated this on Sundays throughout the day and night, they are obviously very solidarity-based, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone.&quot;
Although everything is relative, yesterday&#39;s expansion over interest rates on European government bonds brought water to the governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can&#39;t talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s notation office said it could degrade Portugal&#39;s debt record, a target most targeted by various speculations.
&quot;Because the lack of a transparent and obvious policy, based mainly on banking systems, is real in May,&quot; said Exane economists BNP Paribas.
All the more so as &quot;political time is running slower than market time&quot;.
Aware of this broken context and the danger it poses, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most affected by the issue, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
With regard to the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin group from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is being held today.
The fate of unconventional measures to support market-oriented euro area countries is on the agenda (see above).
As for the European Finance Fund (FESF), its CEO, Klaus Regling, lent a trip to Asia on Tuesday to inform Asian investors about the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this path is not to increase funds, it is certainly preparing the ground for achieving this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in mobilized funds through additional direct involvement in the FMI.
The countries in question, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards the organization of the labor market.
Reforms that are accompanied by rigorous measures with rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
At all costs, both countries want to avoid asking for international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms needed to regain lasting confidence.
Finally, equity participants in European funds are talking about options available to speed up the process of normalizing sovereign bond markets.
During his trip to Paris on November 24, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough, the Union would not hesitate to touch the stock of securities again.
Economists from Barclays Capital, an actor in the very first plan to trade European sovereign claims, believe that an addition of about 100 billion euros would be enough, &quot;preferably&quot; in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
There is a means: it is the European Financial Stability Facility, subsidized to date by EUR 60 billion.
A Council that has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange emergency.
Snow allocations still cause transport difficulties, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four districts now have an orange emergency due to the risk of snow and ice.
L&#39;Eure, l&#39;Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, have joined 20 districts that already have declared an orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night .
According to Météo France, heavy torrents of snow are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and it is snowing lightly on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the districts concerned and snow cover from 1 to 3 cm, sometimes up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d&#39;Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowstorms are large enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the coast of the Côtes d&#39;Armor, some districts have banned the passage of heavy goods vehicles - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
According to the police, road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult and the police recommend driving with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been canceled for the day.
In Picardy, school connections were banned on Thursdays.
No special measures to limit freight traffic are foreseen on Wednesday evening.
The district office &quot;calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt their driving to the nature of the road&quot;.
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy airport in Paris and 10% to Orly on Thursday due to expected snowstorms.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Billions have been raining since the debate on transport modernization on Ile-de-France is in full swing.
At least during the discussion.
We are particularly reminiscent of the $ 23 billion Grand Paris Metro to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order for this construction to be launched, the state announced the provision of a subsidy of 4 billion euros.
Purely theoretically, this is an amount that will then allow SGP to use part of its funding from its dual source for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Rectification Finance Act, which is being examined by the National Assembly&#39;s Finance Committee this morning, contains mechanisms in place to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads &quot;in favor of the public institution Société du Grand Paris&quot;.
It is quantified: &quot;The revenue from this interest is 117 million euros per year&quot;.
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists &quot;in order to modernize it in order to increase the revenue generated from it and to affect Société du Grand Paris&quot;.
How much would it cost?
Phantasm.
This is not enumerated in the text.
We are far from 4 billion.
&quot;It is specified that these fiscal resources are added to the 4 billion euros in the capital subsidy, which will be mobilized by the state and invested in Société du Grand Paris according to the project,&quot; we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
At SGP, this system does not seem shocking.
&quot;From the moment we generate revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover studies for three years and then rake in 4 billion,&quot; he explains.
&quot;It will be budgeted and used as needed.&quot;
SGP estimates that 4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the 4 billion promised belong to absent subscribers, risks provoking a somewhat busy parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and industrious spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and anticipates a future dominated by regression.
But let&#39;s move on.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The &quot;extraordinary revelations&quot; of Americans about Berlusconi&#39;s sexual life tell them what everyone could read in any newspaper for months (all but the two Berlusconi&#39;s own), and the unfortunate cartoon profile of Gaddafi has long been a topic for sketches for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret documents may only consist of reports already known is fundamental to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of occult texts does not like to look for new information (he doesn&#39;t even know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who practice occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have learned before. .
That is the mechanism of Dan Brown&#39;s success.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is a lazy, and lazy (or limited-spirit) head of the secret services (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, an editor in the Libération newspaper), who considers only what he admits to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the US embassy sent to the state ministry was the same as Newsweek had published the week before.
So why has so much fuss been made about the revelations about these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II and since the heads of state can call or fly by plane for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the national team were transformed into spy centers.
Any viewer watching an investigation film knows very well that it is out of hypocrisy that is seemingly ignored.
However, the fact that it is repeated in public denigrates the obligation of hypocrisy and sheds a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most classified information from the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not a not inconsiderable one, to the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and its &quot;executors&quot;.
But let&#39;s move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell&#39;s time, all power could be conceived, like a Big Brother who controlled every movement of its people.
Orvell&#39;s prophecy has been proven since, thanks to the ability to control every movement by telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, the citizen became a complete victim of a wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now that even &quot;tombs&quot; with the most secret information of the powerful cannot withstand the intervention of a hacker, the control report ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen&#39;s avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets be maintained?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a true secret is a meaningless secret (and a meaningless secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious meaningless secret, because it is taken out of public life; but to discover, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton&#39;s secrets were empty secrets is to take away all his power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but did something great to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to the inflicted power so significant?
Obviously, in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be tantamount to posting it on a poster affixed to a street corner.
But it is also quite clear that with current technology it is useless to hope that messages over the phone can be kept secret.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and connected with one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I am well aware that for the time being, my prognosis belongs to science-fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I must imagine government officials who discreetly carry out formalities on uncontrollable routes and carry only those messages that they know by heart or rather hide rare information in the heel of the shoe.
The information will be stored in unique copies in key-closed drawers: all in all, the attempt to spy on the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways, that is, backwards.
One century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated a wire-based telegraph (telephone).
Video tapes (analogue) allowed cinema lovers to shoot the film step by step, move it back and forth and reveal all the secrets of the montage, while now CDs (digital) only allow you to jump chapter by chapter, that is, macro macro.
We will drive from Rome to Milan in three hours by express train, while we need three and a half hours to travel by plane and the transport it involves.
It is therefore not extraordinary that politics and communication techniques will return to horse-drawn carriages.
Last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what the secret of the embassy was.

Climate: how France hacked its promises of funding
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to test keeping on the promises of fast-unlocked funding (called fast start or early funding), implemented by developed countries.
And big French hacks have been uncovered
Under the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged $ 30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union has pledged € 7.2 billion over three years and France € 1.26 billion (ie € 420 million a year).
At the launch of COP16, the EU took a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report detailing its Member States&#39; event, a press conference, a grand side event, brochure distribution ...
A transparent operation invaluable and valued at its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do them equally and with the same degree of precision.
The EU announces that it has released € 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its € 7.2 billion pledge in 2012.
But if we focus on the detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, these funds are &quot;new and additional&quot; to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to State Aid for Development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what is meant by &quot;new and additional&quot;.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonization, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 to be a reference: international funding has been maintained and it is adding 150 million to the three-year fast start funding title.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of public development aid.
By contrast, France considers that the funding of &quot;all new projects&quot; in 2010 is &quot;new and additional&quot;.
In other words, there is no reference to previous period expenditure or to the global level of Public Aid for Development d&#39;Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of France&#39;s support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even reduced), it has to honor its commitment to finance &quot;new and additional&quot; ...
Another crucial element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that € 1 borrowed equals € 1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be demonstrated for some investments that are profitable (often emission reduction projects based on more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present the one euro we get as equivalent to the one euro we give ..., they should not We would understand it by virtue of its liabilities, but as the price of the loan to the creditor country (ie the equivalent interest rate).
But France can only give such a justification: it &quot;keeps&quot; its commitment of 420 million euros, of which 91.5% is a loan (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% donations (36.1 million euros) - see document EU so you can verify for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union to use a loan on such a scale.
Germany has demanded 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are keeping their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union gives € 1 in fulfillment of its promise, France will give only 10 centimes and considers this effort to be comparable.
A beautiful piece of juggling!
In summary, in its &quot;fast start&quot; financing, France operates with a double shading: on the one hand with the development of the stock over time and on the other hand with a real financial burden.
Although it spends only 36.1 million euros, it can be convinced that it is spending 420 million euros &quot;new and additional&quot; in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it was Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate if they only borrow?) And in negotiations, because development countries are not completely naive ...
The chapter on early financing is only a small issue, relatively short-lived, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let&#39;s hope that&#39;s not our case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France should announce a change in its way of keeping the accounts for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respecting its obligations and of decency and fairness towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussing deposits in long-term financing (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): we will not escape the question of &quot;additionality&quot; or how to account for loans.
France should change its position to make it as progressive on these deposits as it is on others.
So everyone has hopes for the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will be coming to Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement of France&#39;s fast start and its vision of &quot;additionality&quot; and the use of loans could trigger the increase in the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
A warning about pesticides that children eat.
One day, a ten-year-old child will see 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (ex- Movement for Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results &quot;do not have significant statistical value due to the low number of analyzed samples, but are characteristic of the processed issues&quot;, bought food normally consumed in four meals and one snack as a light snack per child between July and September. about ten years in supermarkets in l&#39;Oise and Paris.
These typical dishes, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day - as well as confectionery, were analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five are clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as interferers for endocrine (PE) glands. , according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
&quot;Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we see well in our research that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogens, and / or PE is striking,&quot; the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea contain about ten residues with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
An apple imported from Brazil, reported in the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same is true for green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, for which studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steak, canned tuna, and even buns and chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemicals.
Analyzes revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform in tap water.
Salmon steak for dinner was &quot;the richest&quot; with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not avoid analysis.
The ultimate risk for consumers of this &quot;cocktail of contaminants&quot; is likely to be underestimated, &quot;the study said.
Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) has proposed &quot;in the face of an emergency&quot; to establish a moratorium on pesticide use in order to stop the &quot;rise of diseases of civilization&quot;.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 were in cereals.
