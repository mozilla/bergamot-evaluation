An unusually open and unique painting by Karel Gott in the feature documentary film by Olga Špátová
This unique film feat from Olga Špátová's workshop will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In the middle of September last year I received a call from Ivanka and Karel Gott, and they asked me to make a documentary about his life again with Karl after ten years. I didn't hesitate for a minute! Filming with a man who lasted more than half a century in the limelight of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence, was and is a great honour for me. The challenge to make a feature-length documentary film about Karel Gott, which brings joy to three generations of listeners with my art, I accepted as a commitment to this legendary singer," director Olga Špátová describes her feelings.
The first shooting day was thus already done, thanks to a quick agreement and agreement. October of last year and the last footage with Karel Gott were shot a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - capturing authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who is distributed to his supporters, as a painter but also a loving husband and father of his children. A man who has spent sixty years giving joy to several generations with his songs, not only in our country, but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has entered the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not intended to be a showcase of Karel Gott's undisputed glory and his achievements. "Therefore, it is impossible to compare my previous film, Phenomenon Gott, with this present. It's all different. At a minimum, by filming them in another life stage in Karel Gott's life, and that will be very reflected in his personal, almost intimate confession he has provided to us, which has confirmed to us all of us in what legend we have the opportunity to work and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, in meetings with his fans in the Czech Republic and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at the cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. The film will thus be completely authentic and unique thanks to Karel Gott's sincere openness.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with his narrow team so that we often got carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let it into our privacy, which made me talk about the topics of the relatively confidential. She and her husband, the cameraman Jan Painter, actually became part of our family. We originally wanted to release the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life's jubilee. But because I had a lovely summer with my family, I wanted us to film for as long as possible. Well, because there was a lot of me everywhere in 2019, my wish was to be released in cinemas in the spring of next year. This documentary film is a thank you to my supporters and to all who supported and accompanied me in my profession," Karel Gott himself says of the film.
Insects are up to 60 times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Bugs, butterflies and other species make up more than half of their lives on Earth. But there are more reports that the insect empire is shrinking radically. Another scientific study on the subject came out just this week, and the situation, she said, was even more serious than humanity had ever realized.
The study is based on field research in the tropical forest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As the report reads at the outset, the insects are now "ten to 60 times less" in the jungle. This is a decline in the entire population, i.e. not the number of species, while the research involved not only insects but all the arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna, which is dependent on insects in the food chain, such as birds, frogs or lizards, is also dwindling.
The authors of the research put their conclusions directly in the context of climate change. The average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years, and warming has become a driving force behind the collapse of the food chain. The study thus shows, according to the author's team, that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much greater than previously believed.
A major article about the report was published Monday in the Washington Post, which gives the new findings in the headline as hyperalarm. "This is one of the most disturbing articles I have ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, who is quoted as an independent expert, told the paper.
The extinction of insects also affects Europe. "For us, the decline is also of the order of magnitude," points out Lukáš Čížek from the Entomological Institute of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, however, in addition to climate change, it is necessary to take into account the transformations of the landscape, which play an essential role in Europe. "We only run for a significantly longer time than in Puerto Rico," Čížek adds by explaining why scientists could have measured such a rapid decline in the forest in the forest compared to the 700.
Czechs in Europe Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and go to war with Germany? Three Times NO
The undathe shot depicts Adolf Hitler on a visit to the Czechoslovak border fortification. The task of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow its advance before the Allies were involved.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would take the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, air force, or artillery? It might not be either of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the most losses - because of the blisters.
Police union president Stepanek resigned, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Union, Milan Štěpánek, has decided to leave office. It was presented on Friday by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál. Stepanek has led the union since 2005. He will be president of the union for two more months. He will remain with the police and after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that I have handed over to the Bureau this week my written resignation, after which I will continue to serve full for two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnál. "I've decided to be a free man who doesn't want to be bound to the union forever. And who wants to live a quieter life," he said, explaining the reasons for leaving.
The independent trade union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the Association participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions on better condition for security forces. He also got into a dispute with the then Interior Minister Radek John in 2011, for example, and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the ruling coalition later agreed to leave John.
Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with the exhibition
Imitation of a normalisation room with a television, in which the conduct of the brutal police intervention of police officers against the students on 17 November 1989 in Prague. This, too, is at the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said the exhibition's curator, Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was basically the same everywhere with the first demonstration in Semily on 22 November, and then other people were gradually packed up every day," he said. Among the most active were a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one in the city and immediate area to sign Charter 77, and Mr. and Mr. and Mrs. Grandfather, who expanded the Several Sentences petition. Quite quickly, according to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was created at the time. "One specific feature is that there was a very strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
The events in the city at the time should draw visitors to about 50 photographs, the pictures taken by Karel Bárta 30 years ago. A video of the general strike on 27 November 1989 preserved by František Tomíček, which will be played in a loop throughout the exhibition. At the demonstration, Ivan the Voice also sang at the demonstration. The Semil archive also lent a number of preserved banners to the exhibition. "On them was: Let's not get drunk with a roll, From trough to trough, We don't want violence," Chvátal said. Some of the changes in the city were very quick at the time, for example, in December, people decided in a omenshe vote that the square would be Riegrovo and revoked the previous name Gottwald.
The exhibition also depicts events ahead of the events in November. "In the first part, we present to the old-timers and students what was before, such a late normalization. I think we have managed to collect unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plaque from the then Museum of the Workers' Movement," Chvátal said. One room is just meant to make you feel about what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household.
The last part of the exhibition is devoted to what was after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We've embedded one of the polling tillas rooms. Those who have experienced it will reminisce about the posters with us to Europe or there are Václav Klaus still under the heading OF with the beautiful motto Everyone for His Village," the curator added.
Make sure the fans are positive, Hasek wishes. Sparta awaits a hit in Pilsen
"We'll play to the limit, we'll do everything we can to succeed. To make the match in the game and the result," Spartan Martin Hašek promised in an interview for club television.
In the week, the goal was scored by a cup duel in Jihlava (2-1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for her. She was relieved, but the game is still in trouble.
Even though the season is slowly spilling over into the second period, Soccer Sparta is still looking for a face that coach Václav Jílek was talking about at the outset of his engagement.
'But it's still Sparta, which has very good players. We are going to have a difficult match," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans arrived in the Shtrunc orchards for the last time, in mid-May it was a clear-cut affair in the superstructure. The visitors left after a mindless performance with a 0-4 thrashing, the biggest in the history of the Czech league.
While the gap between the clubs in the table was eight-point at the time before the match, Sparta now lose nine points after ten games of the new season. He is experiencing one of the worst entries in the season ever.
"It's not an easy situation for us or for the fans who would like to see their beloved club very different from the one they are at the moment," suspects Hasek. "But we'd like to continue to support us, to stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if he will be able to use Tetteh in Pilsen, who received a two-match penalty for being suspended in Pilsen but appealed against him on Friday.
The numerous sickbay remain Costa, Dockal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejčí and Kadlec, who is the only one of the cadre to remember the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011.
The home side, who won the last five matches, including Wednesday's Cup in Hlučín, should only miss midfielder Cermak. And as captain, they should be led into the match by defender Jakub Brabec, the Spartans' offspring.

"Any-looking study result." Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable incredulity for Islam in Austrian society.
Nearly 60 percent of Austria's population fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would demand a ban on the construction of mosques. For more monitoring of the centres of Islam, 80 percent are asked.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, and say that the presence of Muslims sometimes make them feel like foreigners in their own country.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "Such a tendency to ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a risk that the religious freedoms granted to Muslims will be narrowed."
For believers, the critical stance is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria, it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. To help blunt polarization could, according to the sociologist, dialogue and education.
The most hostile attitudes toward Muslims are held by the extreme right, those without a university education, or seniors over the age of 75, according to the study. The most welcoming, on the other hand, are the Greens voters, the people under the age of 30, and the college students.
According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, there are approximately 700,000 Muslims in Austria, which has a population of around 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. There are more than 400 Muslim prayers and mosques in the country, and Islam has been officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
Thomas Cook: The Czechs were kicked out of a hotel in Mallorca. The guarantees were not enough
The insolvency petition was also filed in the week by the Austrian, German and Polish divisions of the group. The future of the Czech branch is being discussed at the moment, a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to the vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan Papež, there are three options in play for possible solutions - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or the team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which one of them will be, but it is impossible to predict, it will be up to the German owner," he told the Czech News Agency today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, the TA also addresses cases where clients had to pay for their stay out of their own, although the company is trying to provide guarantees to the hoteliers. TA promised to reimburse its clients for the payments, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient collateral to do so.
Problems in hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked for help from the Czech consulate. In this context, the Pope described to the Czech News Agency one of the cases in which the hotel there fired all the tourists' offices. "The hector could not determine who belonged to the German and who under Czech society. He therefore fired everyone from the hotel even though the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its revenues to CZK 995 million last year, up almost 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company's net profit, on the other hand, fell by roughly seven million to CZK 15.3 million. However, from previous years, the company's outstanding loss remained nearly CZK 103 million. The branch includes two basic divisions - alongside CK Neckermann, it is the company Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Trump considers revoking US Chinese stock registration
US President Donald Trump's administration is considering revoking Chinese firms' stock market trading permits in the United States. Reuters was told by an informed source today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the companies in question on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down after the news, pulling the entire market with them.
The withdrawal of the shares would be part of a broader effort to cut US investment in China, the source added. He confirmed the Bloomberg report, which had recently caused a shock to the financial markets. Shares of Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost from two to four percent.
According to government data from February, the US Nasdaq and NYSE stock exchanges are traded in shares of 156 Chinese firms. There are also at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
Bloomberg noted that an exact mechanism had not yet been developed to secure the withdrawal of Chinese firms' shares from the US exchanges. A possible plan would have to be approved by Trump, who gave the issue the green light to negotiate the matter.
China and the US have been waging a trade war for more than a year, imposing tariffs on each other. The dispute between the two countries has had negative effects on the world economy and is raising concerns about the recession of the global economy. With tariffs, Washington is trying to get Beijing to change trade practices and reduce China's surplus in trade with the US.
According to CNBC, trade negotiations between the US and China should be renewed on the 10th. October. His aim is to end a trade war.
Police accuse CzechTouter manager Aleš Pangrác of contracts to promote
Police have charged the former manager of the state-run CzechTourism agency, Aleš Pangrá, over contracts to promote them. Pangrác of the server SeznamMed with news confirmed that he had taken the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that officers were examining contracts worth CZK 38 million in the case. Police say some of the money was being returned back to Pangrác, the site reports. In the case, forensics officers were also interested in the Minister for Regional Development, Klára Dostálová (for ANO), to whose ministry CzechTourism falls. The investigation in the case continues, according to the server.
Detectives from the National Organized Crime Center secured evidence in the case in the second half of last November. They were, for example, at the headquarters of the Ministry of Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the autodrom in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The service computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. The court's search warrant at Dostálová, which was previously quoted by TIME, said that the minister had made his decision in 2016, when she was deputy, on the expenses of CzechTourism in favour of the chosen persons mediated and outside the standard official procedure. At the time, Dostál said she felt absolutely innocent, made no mistake, could document everything and cooperate fully with the police.
According to the agency, it was an individual's misconduct. The media has previously reported that it is the former director of the Regional Partnership Department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrá, who was dismissed for the results of the audit. This showed that the CzechTourism agency had concluded 48 problematic contracts.
"Yes, I was charged. But I don't want to comment further," Pangrác told the North List of News.

From a religious school in Nigeria, hundreds of enslaved children were freed
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, reported that there were over three hundred children from the age of five above. Some were chained to each other, others were tied to the iron circles in the wall.
The head of the police in Khamin, Ali Janga, told the BBC that the raid at the school was conducted on the basis of a tip-off. He called the school a house of horrors. The starving people there were being held forcibly, tortured and sexually abused. They couldn't leave, there was a razor wire above the walls. According to him, it is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained in the raid, according to police spokesman Jakub Sabo, they were a teacher there.
The children told the police they were taken to the school by parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. "We have identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most were brought here by parents from the Nigerian states in the north," a Sabo spokesperson said of the victims' identity. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal's school was posing as a religious school focused on studying the Koran.
The liberation was taken to the stadium, where they are provided with assistance and food. Some have met with relatives.
The French chef is suing Michelin for the removal of the star. I suffer from depression, he claims
The renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after winning it. He intends to sue the publisher of the red guide in order to receive the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competencies of the Michelin inspectors, who he says mistook the saffron for cheddar. The first court hearing is scheduled to take place in November.
The chef of La Maison de Bois, a famous restaurant in the Upper Savoy region of Alpine, lost one of the three Michelin stars in January this year. He will sue the publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Guide, the publisher of the Le Guide Michelin, because he said the commissioners' conclusion was not properly justified. In addition, the removal of the asterisk took place without any notice. "Six months I suffer from depression. How dare you mess with the health of the cooks?" said Veyrat to the commissioners.
Michelin is said to have provided the chef with vague reasons, such as putting the chef in the soufflé cheddar, which did not appeal to the inspection. 'I put the saffron in it, and the gentlemen thought it was a cheddar because it was yellow. I have worked with love with love with savoy ingredients," Veyrat said. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin Commissioners: "You are fraudsters who are just causing controversy for commercial reasons." The indignant Veyrat doesn't understand "how could they have said that we put in our soufflé cheddar." "They insured our region as well, my staff made mad. We have eggs from our hens, milk from our own cows, gardeners collect fresh herbs every morning," he said.
A prominent chef, always wearing a black hat and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin Commissioners, and therefore calls for the removal of his restaurant from a red guide. However, the publisher refuses to do so. "If the business remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelino's international director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit is that he has no meaningful accusation yet and the lawyer is yet to help form it. "We regret that Mr. Veyrate is making a rough deal with us. But we will examine his comments carefully," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two three-star restaurants.
Technically, a perfect mess with a weak script. Gemini with Will Smith's criticism not the hike
The Dyraclose sci-fi spectacle Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will face his younger version in the film. But critics say the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be watched in Czech cinemas on 10th. October.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the top performer in his field. It kills effectively and without unnecessary questions. One day, however, he decides to hang up his career. This, of course, does not appeal to his employers, who will send another assassin to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, or rather, his younger clone made of DNA. Can one determined man win the fight over himself? This time literally.
A certain guarantee of quality was to be three-time Oscar-winner Ang Lee. It may be his first sci-fi, but he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as he has shown in the aforementioned Tighr and the dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. The script was co-operated by six screenwriters. The most famous is surely David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. But according to the first feedback, even all this was not enough for a good movie.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have the character to highlight it," thinks Fionnuala Hannigan of the Screen Daily.
"This unsatisfactory film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. The weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of the filmmakers," summarized the view of The Hollywood Reporter.
"The missile is a case in which a huge amount of work resulted in an impossibly unhinged action film," Variety reviewer Peter Deburge says.
"A confusing product with a bizarre idea," the film's review was summarized by Ella Kemp of the IndieWire website.
"It's hard to be interested in the fact that one man is the other's double when neither behaves like a person," wrote Nicholas Barber from The Wrap.
Overview of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
The banks provide child bills for free. But the offer needs to be considered because some of the other services to the accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer bills for children, whose basic management is free of charge, is straightforward. Financial houses are counting on the forgiveness of their fees to be refunded one day. The low migration of Czechs among banks is probably not wrong," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
"Little Bills," she says, can do almost anything that adult accounts do. The child gets his own credit card, can enter payments, track movements in the account, somewhere he has his own electronic banking. Banks set up the account, but it is up to the parents to teach the children how to use them and also check their payment.
"After in a flexible way, the parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services, etc. Above all, however, he can monitor what is happening in the account, either by looking over the internet or by informational SMS. Attention, you don't have to be free anymore," Kuncová adds, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, they should consider their abilities and options."
Strict but fair, we enjoy the clock! That's how the Benes Gymnasiums see their favorite teacher writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. The high school teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, novelist and a foment of literary life in a small town.
Above the lyrics of Pavel Hoza, Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind. His poetry, his paintings. Bare trees, whitish country houses, shivering grass, shepherds, sheep and goats, old roads and people who have been after them for centuries. Grieving, cursing, blessing. This Reynek's contemporary continuator teaches at the gymnasium in Benešov's Czech, literature and history, in the local Café a word for a word, he runs the equivalent of Prague's Viola and annually holds the Benešov Literary Festival.
Switching wives: Parents abused Ondra cruelly! Ended up in the Institute
It was about nerve. The allegedly troubled son, Ondřej (9) was harshly punished by his father every so often. "He came home from school and lied to his snack. Lukas looked at me and said he would kneel as punishment," Lucie described in the Exchange. Dad Lukas made little Ondra kneeling in the corner for several hours! Outside the cameras, he said, he had to suffer like this on a wooden pad for a foot massage! "Ondřej came to me after the shoot and told me - auntie, I'm just making trouble and notes so I'm not here because I want to go to the institution," Lucie said, describing the moment when she fully understood what was going on behind the door of the studio. And the wishes of the boy finally came true...
His condition was so serious that he was taken from the family after filming and placed for a month at the Centre for Education Care in České Budějovice. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) briefly, but then went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I got home, Aneta immediately posted to Facebook, we wrote for a while. She was most interested in whether we'd gotten the money. I barely responded to that. But then she texted me that the little one was in the institute, that afterwards they gave it back to them, now he's in the diagnos on the subject. They are both out of work," says mother Lucie from Pilsen.
Lightning, of course, addressed the other side, but received only a hazy answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call back later," Aneta said, and hung up the phone.
Sparta doesn't want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against a double-header penalty
Soccer Sparta has appealed against a two-match penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, who was given to the player by the disciplinary committee for being suspended in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0-3).
The Letenský klub reported on their Twitter feed and is now awaiting the verdict of the appeals committee.
Tetteh has already served half of his penalty in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta are now seeking to have the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker in the 11th round of the first-leg season in Plzeň on Sunday.
The situation last October could be repeated. At the time, Olomouc appealed against the punishment for Šimon Falta, who received a distance from the Disciplinary Board for one game for dismissal against Liberec on Thursday.
The appeals committee failed to hear the case, so it postponed the effectiveness of the penalty and Falta was able to start on Saturday, ironically against Sparta.
The committee finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the next week and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
Disciplinary team Tetteh stopped his activities for a foul on the glory of David Hovorka, for whom he received a straight red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of the Ghanaian player on the captain of the opponent's opponent, Tomáš Souček, has not been proven.
The Germans have chosen to lead the football union Keller
The new chairman of the German Football Association, as expected, was the Bundesligan's current head of the Bundesliga side, Fritz Keller. The 25-year-old winemaker, gastronomer and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, he did not have an opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April over the unacknowledged income affair. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger, and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go to trial for possible bribes when they are awarded the World Cup in 2006.
Keller said one of the main goals would be to restore the union's confidence and take him out of the crisis. "It won't be the One Man Show, many people will be responsible. The League is better than his reputation," said Keller, who presented all his tasks under the slogan: Together, we will.
After being elected to head the union, Keller left the post in Freiburg.
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the underground of the CSA mine in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. No one was injured in it, however, the spokesperson of the mining company Ivo Čelechovský told the Czech Press Agency.
The fire broke out at 04:25 at the whale at a depth of about 1,200 meters. "No employees were hurt, no one was injured. The on-site immediately intervened in the Bánš rescuers, who disposed of the fire by direct intervention and carried out examination of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and inaccessible," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special committee.
The former Ostrava-Karviná district is already mined with coal only in the Karviná part, namely in the ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-Sever and ČSM-South mines. In Dole Lazy, the mining should end later this year, with a gradual decline awaiting the other mines. The mining company OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, with last year's production of 4.62 million tonnes. There are 9,000 people working in the mines.
Berlin responds to public pressure and addresses the housing crisis. Buying 6000 flats from a private company
Berlin will buy from Luxembourg's private Luxembourg-based firm ADO Properties SA for €920 million ($23.8 billion) of the 6,000 former social housing that the city sold 15 years ago. It responds to public pressure that is rebelling against skyrocketing rental prices. According to Berlin Senator Katrin Lompscher for the Left Party (Die Linke), it is the largest such buyout ever in the history of the capital city of Germany. The opposition is critical of the move.
"The intention is to keep the rents stable in Berlin and give the tenants certainty," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new flats and legally treat the rent freeze," he added. The municipal firm Gewobag, with thousands of flats located in the Spandau and Reinickendorf districts in the western part of the city, will take over this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too expensive. He told Bloomberg Rothäusler that he estimated that it had overpaid the housing units by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party, the Liberals (FDP) of the Berlin authorities are contributing to real estate speculation through their actions. The FDP tweeted it on Friday. The move was described as "waste of money" by the protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Already in mid-July, Gewobag won back 670 apartments in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The award was not released by the council at the time. The controversy over the apartments on the former exhibition class from the time of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the oppressive situation of tenants in major German cities, the paper wrote.
Meanwhile, the German metropolis used to be famous for low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained attractiveness. According to AFP, rental prices have doubled over the past decade, making it difficult for some residents to find affordable housing.
Nokia is suing the Brno-based company over the name Lokia. People don't mistake us, Moravians believe
Nokia filed its opposition to the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. According to the CCV, however, product mix-up is unlikely.
The Brno-based company developing software CCV is facing legal action from Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. The Finns don't like the fact that the Brno-based warehouse management company's program is called Lokia WMS, the daily E15 reported. Nokia therefore filed objections to the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. The CCV reckons that confusion is unlikely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said that the program is already used by two dozen customers, the market has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone attempts to register a stamp that we believe may lead to a substitution or a weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said Nokie spokesman Mark Durrant.
Brno developers claim that they did not think of the brand famous for mobile phones in the past when creating a stock program. The designation Lokia, according to CCV, is based on the Latin name for one type of dragonfly, whose rapid movement is to be analogy of warehouse movement.
"On the Czech market, the possibility of confusion is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software that companies equip their warehouse operations with, and we really don't aim in the area of mobile phone manufacturing. And we don't want a comparison to a brandy that may be missing a train in his field," CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák responded in E15.
The CCV applied for the brand protection in August before the programme was launched at the Industrial Property Office. "The protection was requested for products and services belonging to Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to the class 9, related business management services in the warehouse belong to the class 35 and the development of computer software to class 42 according to the international classification," Ondrášek said.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the earlier mark, Nokia, is valid in all classes of goods and services, and thus applies to the widest possible range of goods and services, and therefore, of course, overlap in Classes 9, 35 and 42. 'CCV does not dispute the allegations against the allegations against the argument put forward in those product and service classes. Realistically, however, these are completely different brands aimed at other target groups," Ondrášek said.
The brand dispute could take months, according to E15, and it may complicate the company's activities.
Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, perhaps reality
The Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a rocket. It is designed to powered the aircraft at twice the speeds of the Concordes. "When the Sabre engine is put into operation, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," said Turnock. And the distance between London and New York, for example, could be covered by the plane in one hour.
The Independent notes that so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound is five-fold in excess, are complicated because of the engine overheating. But this problem should be dealt with by Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) thanks to the use of super cold helium to prevent the rise of temperatures.
"The most important thing about the Sabre is that it is a hybrid rocket and aircraft engine that is powered by a jet of exhaust generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "The rockets have not undergone such a big development in the last 70 years, while the aircraft's have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a spacecraft," he said.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to start around the middle of next year. Commercial flights then around 2030.
Kovosvit is selling the administrative building and other halls. Expects worse times
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended up with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million last year, while the consolidated turnover was CZK 1.3 billion. Among the main problems last year, Chef ranks shortfalls of workers and subcontractor shifts. This year, demand for machine tools has fallen, up 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decline in turnover of the order of ten percent," the CEO said. In 2017, Kovosvit had sales of 1.3 billion crowns and a profit after tax of 40.1 million. The loss for 2016 was 719 million.
Kovosvit is now offering for sale several properties, halls and land that he either does not use or minimally. This also applies to the administration building, where it uses two from the five floors, and not quite yet. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan is to scrunch Kovosvit, to streamline its activities. The sale of assets is not part of a current solution, whether it is cash-flow, for example, but part of a long-term plan where we want to devote all the resources to investment development," the CEO said.
About half of Kovosvit's production is exported. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, to a lesser extent in Asia last year. This year, Kuchař ranks among the most interesting in India, where Kovosvit won a contract for five-axis machining machines worth CZK 100 million. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines worth CZK 30 million to China. "Departial is the next contract in the same volume that we would like to fulfill before the end of the year," said Kuchař. In the Russian market and elsewhere, Kovosvit is facing restrictions for sanctions.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centres to France, a subcontractor for Airbus. She supplied it with another machine in May this year, with one more to deliver at the end of the year or early 2020.
The main company investment this year was the transfer of heating from a steam to a hot water for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker's wage is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for bricure casts for the foundry, machinists, latheers and electricians.
The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and arms manufacturer Jaroslav Strnad. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded in 1939 by Tomáš Baťa. The company had up to three thousand employees in its time.
Milan Jakubů: The funeral was stolen for itself by the army! Says Andor Shandor
There is still confusion around the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated in the week that the army's final farewell to the deputy director of Military Investigations was planning, despite the family's wishes, as the soldiers do. There were also discrepancies about the date of the funeral. Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We have been in contact with the family from the beginning, the arranged Friday's funeral date has been valid from the beginning, no one has changed it. As well as military honours. We will only still be dealing with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Lightning on Wednesday. The funeral will eventually take place on Friday and will not be missed all military honours, including the fighter's flyover.
Around the last farewell to the popular general, however, there is a tense atmosphere. The funeral ceremony will not be attended by the decision of the organizers by the people who worked with the general in the past!
These include the former head of military intelligence, Andor Shandor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Shandor remembers the former colleague as a hard-working, intelligent, and "good guy."
In addition, he has met regularly with him in recent years at the anniversary celebrations of the anniversary of the founding of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would go to Milan Jakub's funeral," said Bleska Shand. But he can't.
"I also know of other people from the organization who would like to go, but they are unlucky because the potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I think that privatising a funeral in this way is not right," the security expert said. Nor does he have a supposedly considered closure of the ceremony for the public due to the secrecy of the army's top brass.
"The military's management is not undercover, and the military intelligence leaders are not, either, because they are perhaps promoted at Prague Castle, we see them there. If the media's information is true and the family has actually been betrayed by the army, that is, of course, a matter for the family. Personally, I would never have allowed the army to overwhelm the family and its wishes," Shandor concluded.
Milan Jakubů died in a car accident near Špindlerův Mlýn on Saturday. The head-on collision between Milan's Rapid and the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car, Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer was supposed to enter the opposite direction on the bend, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the clash. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that she will suffer the consequences for the rest of her life. Police interviewed the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Comment by Jan Šindelář: Run the tracks as a company
The Heavenly election, though apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the state's inability to give the runways a clear direction. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday night, it doesn't change because one of the members resigned. The makeshift is taking hold.
The selection process itself was a farce from the outset, if only because the requirements for candidates, especially in the area of practice, were significantly eased. Compared to the selection last year, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was to operate in the past have been reduced. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory boards played only the role of pimprlat.
Heavenly submitted arguably the weakest professional biography of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company he wrestled experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transport businesses. The participation of interesting private-sector managers was perhaps the lightest aspect (and the greatest hope) of the process. By now, those in question know that they only played the role of narrative backdrop in the political game.
Perhaps Sky will surprise him, show great talent, and eventually turn out to be the best runway boss of all time. At least in the beginning, however, it will be accompanied by the aftertaste of the political newsagent. Czech Railways does not expect an easy period, it must cope with competition in market liberalisation and a shortage of staff in operation. There are no drivers, shifters and mechanics. What are the motivations to keep working and respect for management when the state behaves in top management like an elephant in a china?
The second important group is the creditors. How the play will be unloaded at the top of the runways will be seen next spring when the tracks defend the rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. Sadly, someone else goes to the Moody's agency for Czech Railways to defend the rating every year. The agency's frequent changes in the management of the railways and political influence on the company have not escaped, it has criticised them this summer.
The move is spearheading, among other things, the slogan that the state needs to be run as a company. For starters, it would be enough if it ran one large state-owned company as a company, rather than as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be a good idea for the best to run them. They reported, but the state despised them. It can certainly be argued that the post at the top of the railways has always been a political issue. But then we can forgive ourselves for the shenanigans with the selection process.
The pair wrapped the bitch with tape and drowned in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in the village around the Wallachian Hats. The 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog one to two years old, which she wanted to take care of. Her ten-year-old partner, however, did not like the fact that she was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of it.
"He wrapped the animal in duct tape and rope and greatly eliminated his vocal expression. He put the dog in a jute bag that he bound. Then they drove the animal together to the river, where they had thrown it in the bag. The moment the dog was being thrown into the water, the dog was demonstrably alive," said Zlín police spokesperson Monika Kozumplíková.
The following day, the children playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. So they called to the woman passing by and ran. The woman told the incident to the emergency number of police 158.
"Police officers, through the knowledge of the town's residents, have determined who the perpetrator of this incredible act is. And they were not wrong. The man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place," the police spokesperson said.
Expert comments in the field of veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a decidedly harrowing manner as a result of asphyx, when the animal suffered in a matter of a few minutes before the death.
"The perpetrators' actions no doubt point to clear their intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible manner, even if they could donate or sell the dog. The criminal police commissioner from Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in complicity. Both hitherto untamed accused could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková said.
Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen's last album posthumously released
The album Thank You for the Dance (Thanks for the Dance) will feature unpublished material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, with Cohen collaborating with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the songs. On the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically cope with the impending death. He died a month after the release of the album at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials his father had left behind. He has invited a number of musicians to collaborate - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or the singer Beck.
"When we invented the music for our father's words, we used his own characteristic musical techniques. So he's still with us,' Adam Cohen said of the album. "What amazes me most about him is the reactions of those who have heard it before. One by one, they say that Leonard is still alive," he added.
The album's first swallow is the short-lived song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost at home," Cohen sings in his distinctive honeyed voice. He sang of death, suspecting that he would not live to see the release of the new material. He also admitted this in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before he died. "I am ready to die. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable,' he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published his father's poetry collection called The Flame. It will be published in Czech under the name Flame on 31 December by Argo.
First Miss Christa finally went into herself: She dropped a few pounds and immediately saw through
The first modern Miss from 1989 Ivana Christová (49) had overweight problems for years, causing her not only physical problems, but mainly psychological ones. She suffered because she had changed a lot since the Miss Czechoslovakia. But now it looks like she took the reproaches to heart and, with the excess pounds, went into battle. Even if it's a long shot.
She used to be a first-rate beauty who conquered Paris. But it's been thirty years since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty pageant. Not just for the fame, but also for how skinny she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to the strict modeling rules that ordered her to be as narrow and often not eaten. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she was in the mood for.
But she went from hunger strikiness to overeating, which immediately signed up to her figure. In addition, Kila tried to disguise various loose clothes, but it added to the hip shapes on the size.
Now it looks like Ivana really went at her own right. She lost weight visibly, dressed tastefully and suitably to her fuller figure.
All those present were surprised at the christening of the book by Milos Zapletal (75) that she had seen through again and already had back the features of a glamorous brunette who, in 1989, entered history not only as the first Miss winner after the revolution, but also the controversy her victory caused.
Christova will be the first beauty winner forever, but also the very first one, to which the audience in the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistle as a glimpse of her when she put on a crown.
"Parodies to justice." Scientist warns of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish base
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. It concluded that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to an increased incidence of cancer in the local population.
The scientists mentioned mainly the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which is about 80 kilometres from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and metallinki plants are based. People living around it, they say, suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan retaliates for coup, international criticism notwithstanding
Sik thought the government, notwithstanding the clear findings of the study, did not take any action on the matter. He wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities subsequently began prosecuting him for leaking classified information.
"The study has clearly shown the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of the studies directly related to public health may be kept undercame. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"The Turkish authorities, instead of persecuting the alarms through the courts, should investigate this important problem for public health," said Andrew Gardner of the Turkish AI branch.
Organisations involved in the protection of the environment and human rights have long accused the Turkish Government of not enforcing environmental regulations in certain regions, despite the rapid development of industry.
After the thwarted 2016 coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's regime launched a massive wave of arrests. Nearly 80,000 people are now behind bars, including a number of Cumhuriyet staff. The authorities also suspended from duty or fired 300,000 civil servants and members of the armed forces in full.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the attempted coup to persecute its opponents. But the authorities argue that these are the measures needed to ensure national security.
The fastest man on the planet missed tests. I'm not taking anything, he's fighting back
The traditionally highly watched contest for the fastest man on the planet will be a hurry at the World Championships on the defending silver champion Christian Coleman. The 23-year-old American is the world's world leader with a time of 9.81 seconds and has lost only once this year. His start at the height of the season, however, was at risk due to a case with missed doping tests.
The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case without being charged in early September for formal reasons. Coleman did not take three doping exams last year and this year, but not in 12 months. His first offense was dated back to 1 April 2018, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), to the start of the second quarter, but he skipped the test itself up to the sixth time. June. And because the third omission took place on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit the offense in the form of three untested inspections in 12 months.
Coleman argued that he had only forgotten to update the data in the athlete's residence application. "I don't take drugs or take anything legal. Many athletes take legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's about," he said before the start of the World Championships.
His only defeat in his six starts at the 100 this year, he suffered as soon as he entered the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was outnumbered by compatriot Noah Lyles by just six thousandths of a second. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run the 200 at the World Championships.
The paper's second fastest competitor, with a performance of 9.86, is 22-year-old Nigerian player Divine Oduduru, who has only done well at the US college competitions so far.
Defending the title will be the 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 at Stanford in June. He ran the last hundred in Zagreb but only in 10.29 because he slightly injured his hind thigh muscle.
The favourite circuit also includes South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic gold medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse or European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican with a time of 9.96 is the 2011 world champion Yohan Blake.
The men's 100 will begin on Friday with a pre-season and heats. The semi-finals and the final are on Saturday. The medal will be run at 21:15 GMT.
Fall of plane at Žinkov in Pilsen: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people were travelling on the plane, a man (†63) and a woman (†38). "The aircraft at 8:30 p.m. requested permission to land at the Chaloupky airport near Klatovy," police spokesperson Dana Ladman said. This was also the last recording, at that time, according to the GPS coordinates, it was supposed to be at Vojovic near Žinkov.
But it no longer reached the Klatovy airport. The lost aircraft, which had sent out a distress signal, began to be searched immediately. "A military helicopter was involved in addition to the police," police spokesperson Martina Korandová said. But the happy ending was not the search operation.
In the woods near Petrovic, near Měčín, which is about six kilometres from where the plane was last rounded, the wreckage of the helicopter crew noticed the wreckage before 9 a.m. "We found a plane and two bodies with no sign of life," Korand confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of the trees, the pieces also hit the ground nearby. "We will be investigating the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and staff of the Institute for Professional Investigation of the Causes of Air Accidents," Korandová added.
Civilization in the time lent
Recently, I was reminded of a beautiful "climb" from one of the great short stories, Simek and Grossmann, set out partly in the cemetery, which reads as follows: "I pointed out to her that she is crying well, but on a foreign grave!" It occurred to me that very similarly now behaved by many of the world's politicians involved in the senseless fight against climate change.
They behave as if the planet Earth were ruled by humans. In fact, we are just a speck on its surface, which she can blow out with her gorgeous forces like a fierce gust of wind a candle flame. Perhaps few of them look at the famous British and American natural history papers dealing with the destruction skills of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to be properly "screwed up" and our advanced civilization will poop.
And that it will happen in the near future is highly likely. Many of the large volcanoes, in the view of leading volcanologists, are "charged and armed" (for example, by Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it had to happen, had happened as soon as possible. Even before the billions of dollars are wasted for a measure to reduce carbon dioxide, because any really angry sop, along with the dust and toxic volcano, can release it into the atmosphere at least a hundred times more than has been spared at the expense of the people of Europe.
So it makes no sense to restrict CO2 production. In addition, it has been scientifically proven that, with its significantly higher share in the air, the plants are more biological matter and are also more drought-resistant. For mankind, any warming is considerably more favorable than, for example, the rapid return of the Ice Age would be.
If we make it aware of the still under-explored impact of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us try to keep the Earth as pure as possible and to other changes that we cannot measure with force, try to adjust with the least cost!
Repair to the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late
The Krkonoše National Park Authority (KRNAP) has pushed the deadline for submitting bids to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabí for three weeks. The original deadline for the opening of the envelopes was on 20 September, said the spokesman of the national park, Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponement of the deadline for the submission of bids is the reduction of the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change in the budget, the price we expect to be offered. If someone makes an offer that is acceptable, then the work will start as soon as possible," Drahný said.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the museum's repair is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor for the construction part by the end of last year and start construction work this spring. According to the management of the National Park Service, the European subsidies of CZK 123 million for the project are not at risk.
The administration of KRNAP is failing to choose the construction company for the museum's repairs. The second contest was announced this summer, as in the previous tender all the company's bids far exceeded the then projected price of 65 million. The bids exceeded CZK 100 million.
The museum, which is housed in a former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide for the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of the new exhibition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. The now cleared building should be created by the end of 2021 after the conversion of the expositions of the KRNAP visitor centre.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be a story of nature and people perched in the mountains and build on the successful Stone and Life Exhibition, should serve as a representative entrance gate for visitors as the representative entrance gate of the Giant Mountains. The visitor centre should provide the most understandable form of information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains and motivate people to discover and protect the mountains. It should also take on the role of the traditional museum. The centre will also offer opportunities for concerts, festivals, theatre performances or open-air lectures. The plans include building a new entrance to the building, creating a research room or a café.
Toyota of hydrogen still believes, preparing second generation of Mirai
The Toyota Mirai should never have been a concept. Toyota was so serious about her that while there was virtually no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, she still put it on the menu. Not to the very standard, the customer really had to go after this car in a targeted way, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.
Toyota's chief executive Takeshi Uchiyamada confirmed at an international conference on hydrogen that a new generation will be coming next year. Indeed, Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be priced for hybrids within a decade. Of course, this is linked to the development of pumping networks. However, the future is linked to hydrogen as much as electricity.
The conference often used the word hydrogen with the needs of eco-operating not cars, but on the contrary of large trucks, ships, trains, etc. Just the means of transport that need to be traveled for one long-distance refueling. The purely battery-powered versions cannot offer this. Toyota could thus find new outlets thanks to its great experience and long development.
It remains to be recalled that, like Toyota, Hyundai, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover, believes in hydrogen propulsion.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There's not just one red
When choosing red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - see the veins on your wrist. If they're blue, you're a cold type, if green, then you're one of the types of warm. When choosing a new red lipstick, put it in the first row on the line just for the classification based on the undertone. Only in the next one, look at the texture.
If you rank with women with a cold undertone, then lipsticks are suitable for you in purple, plum, cherry or mauve.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertones, choose such lipsticks as well. You can tell them by the fact that they gravitate to orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen to you that some veins look green and others in blue. In that case, congratulate yourself - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your color preferences.
Purpose slander? Ústecká zoo looking for a new vet, no one is interested
Last time was the end of this month. The city's management blames this on the rumors that sprang up around the former director of the zoo and at the same time veterinarian Václav Poživil for purposefully killing the exotic animals he cared for. For example, it was the female rhino Zamba, the elephant Kalu or the orangutan Nyuňák.
The city council therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of the CZK 3.5 million outfit, excluding VAT, and for the city's Centre for Animals in the Urgency with an estimated value of the CZK 2.8 million in the performance without VAT," said city spokesperson Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that the city is announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. "Dr. Poživil had to explain the unsubstantiated suspicions. I consider it an outrageous defamation of such a quality expert," she noted.
Experts specialising in exotic animals are very few, she says. "It's certainly not pleasant. The zoo has so far provided veterinary care in the form of orders," she said. Orders and contracts cost the same money. "But the garden must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of funding," explained zoo spokesperson Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is among the respected experts. He participated, for example, in a unique operation in which the Ústí gephardice Jane was the first cheetah in the world to receive a total prosthesis. He served as director of the zoo between 2009 and 2012. He did not comment on the anonymous rumors. Yesterday, he did not accept phone calls or respond to text messages.
As far as the commission for the zoo is concerned, some veterinarians think that there is not necessarily any concern for it of such purposeful allegations, as in his case, but simply a little awareness. For example, the veterinarian in Ústí, Jiří Král, has not heard of her. "This is your first time I've heard it. Nobody approached us. Such a thing will spread quickly, I think," he added.
Line D line will be overseen by the new architect of the metro, bringing experience from the London Underground
The Prague Transport Company has chosen an architect to oversee the shape of the metropolitan metro. From October, Anna Švarc will become it, her first task will be the look of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing station. According to her, the metro cannot be viewed only as a transport structure, the underground travel should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who co-authored the reconstruction of three London metro stations, won a tender announced by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition, 14 applicants participated in the tender. "Part of the selection process was a motivation letter and a resume. Apparently my previous practice from London, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the metro there in the team of three people," says the new architect of the metro. In her view, her practice from the Institute of Planning and Development of the City could also have been decided. Prague.
The Metro doesn't just see it as a traffic fucrative structure. The stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have ideas about how the subway will change, how the space will be improved, how the space will be improved. But how it will be realistically will be known in the coming weeks, when the transport company introduces me to my ideas," Švarc says.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations aimed at maintaining the context of all stations in the event of being reconstructed," the manual says.
Whether a similar instrument is also the way to improve public space in the Prague metro is in question. The Prague metro is specific. "Whether the manual is ideal or whether a personality can cover it up, I really don't know yet," Švarc concludes.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, with public commemoration on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. French media are reporting the news, citing the Chirac family. The ceremony will be private.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at the commemorated at Paris's Invalides, where a coffin of Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Élysée Palace announced.
Crowds have been pouring into the presidential residence since Thursday evening, according to AFP, to sign the book of condolence. That will be possible until Sunday. Then, on Monday, President Emmanuel Macron declared a national mourning.
Meanwhile, further reactions from the world and from France are coming to the death of the former mayor of Paris and the president from 1995 to 2007, who Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today called "Francouze in the truest sense of the word."
Chiraca was remembered by the Japanese, for example, as the politician was known for his love of their country and the sum sport. News of the former French president's death appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sportsmanship, the French press notes.
The tribal art museum on the Quai Branly avenue in Paris, founded by Chirac, will not collect admission fees in honour of the former head of state.
The opening of the Pumpkin World was delayed by the mating of the pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrodsko) - Farm in Nové Ves u Leština na Havlíčkobrodsko opened Pumpkin World for more than a month today. Decorations stacked from thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by a mighty orange pyramid in the garden. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, starts this year a week later, as the pumpkins on the surrounding seven hectares of the Pipka family's fields have been matured for longer. There are still a lot of them in the field, Jaroslava Pipková told the Czech Press Agency today.
The Pipes have been growing many kinds of pumpkins, but the weather has not been favoured by the weather for the last two years. This year's harvest was delayed and some species did not come out. "We have plenty of orange pumpkins for Halloween as usual, but some species have failed for connoisseurs," Pipková said. Nevertheless, it is possible to choose from several species on the farm, from the aforementioned large pumpkins suitable for carving and gobbling decorations through pumpkins for cooking hokaido or the oblong "spaghette" to ornamental gouge of various colours and shapes.
Pumpkin cultivation is laborious. Farmers use the hand to hog the plants and harvest their fruits, cutting off the pumpkin with scissors from the stint. The Pumpkin World has been regularly opening Pipka since 2010, with thousands of people attracted past years. The decoration from pumpkins is complemented by attractions made of straw or a maze of logs. Visitors will also see animals bred on the farm. It will be open daily until 3 November.
Details of the event are on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, even pumpkin muffins or juice. Other options for the pumpkin finish in the kitchen are called by the visitors themselves. "A lot of cookbooks have tried their recipes, and we get inspired," Pipková said. She noted that some of the housekeepers also pickled pumpkins on sourdails like cucumbers.
The stress lump sum is planned by the Ministry from 2021. Taxation is unchanged
The I.M.F. is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for meals directly. According to the I.M.F., a quarter of employees, or about a million people who do not receive meal vouchers, will benefit from food support, according to the I.M.
However, according to the chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, David Rýc, a number of small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide their employees with meals, such as importing food or an agreement with restaurants.
"The basis of the intention is that we do not change the tax advantage. It will also not be paid for health and social insurance," Schiller said on Friday. It added that the threshold for the maximum employer's maximum contribution, applicable, would also be maintained as a tax credit.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of the meal voucher. The remainder is paid for by the employee, and in some cases the employer pays for them, but no longer a tax credit. The most advantageous value of the meal voucher for both employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championships
Kayaking drivers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec and canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Aquatic Slalom Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifying, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. Three other Czech representatives will be looking for a semi-final start in the afternoon's corrective qualifying run in Spain.
From the strong representative group of kayakers, Vavřinec Hradilek failed, receiving a 50-second penalty at the start of the run for passing the goal incorrectly. He and Prskavec, on the other hand, can already rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
"I got the goal of getting down the first run until the 30th, which I did. Not that I didn't care how I turned out, because it starts very early in the morning on Sunday, so I was hoping to be a little bit higher to have a better starting position," said Přindiš, praising the comfort in Seu. "Before the Watch Race, I felt at my worst in the 14 days we've been here. Then in the race it was good and today it was better again. It's beautiful, nice races all the time, the crowd came, so fine," he smiled.
The Flash was also happy. "In qualifying, one doesn't want to make a pointless mistake. In the first few gates I didn't really get it. Then I did a great job of the center, no problem, and I knew I had a mileage, so the second mistake came when I wanted to go down right and I turned the door around the eruption. Overall, I can't be unhappy. The form is, we will see how it goes from there," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that they would not start until the end of the semi-final block on Sunday. "I'm not a rinse bird, it's also cold in the morning, and when you're here for eight, it wants to have a jacket and a hoodie," said Přindiš. "Overall, it takes an hour and a half to reach the semi-finals, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," Prskavec agreed.
Of the trio of Czech singles singles, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the advancing 20-year-old, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I went down the top part as expected, in the middle passage I felt like I wasn't late and I wasn't going as planned, but I was able to get into the comfort track I wanted to go. I made two nudges and I'm just behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals," Fišerová said.
Coal will give way to both gas and core. Renewable sources will not cover the increased demand, says European ExxonMobil chief
Renewables will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future demand for energy. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be replenished with additional alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with HN, Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the US-based ExxonMobil, one of the global oil drillers, says so. At the same time, he mentions that large repositories to store unused energy from days when both the sun and the wind are plentiful are still too expensive.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil centre in Prague, which houses 1,200 people, which is tasked with supporting the company's business activities and providing the logistics and other services needed for the company's operation.
The Declaration of the End of the Right in the House or Jakápak "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
There have been recent reports of the upcoming coalition of the parties being upcoming in the media and comments. Many applaud that the "right" is finally coming together, but I am more likely to ask why these parties are still calling themselves right-wing.
Leaving aside the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the subjects refer to themselves or what the names are parroted by the mainstream media. The ODS, in its average of the party's top politicians, is hardly centrist, with TOP 09 clearly the party of the city's pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism, and so hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that, through its conception, ideology and voter targeting, it essentially merges with the TOP 09 (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me). And KDU even labels itself in the long run as a mid-day - but their political compass is much farther to the left than they say.
Do you feel like I took everyone out of one of the water clean? No, I am based on the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself to be a classic liberal right-wing voter, the highest value for me is the freedom of the individual, the free market and the minimal state's interference with the lives of individuals and the economy. How do these parties fulfill this general presumption of right-wing? How many laws to slashing people's freedoms by the salami method, raising taxes, affirming new regulations and increasing oversight, increasing links to the socialist EU or supporting environmental and gender madness have been supported in recent years? A lot, a lot. Not their own labels, but the actions identify them. These parties, despite all sorts of declarations or partial concessions, want to strengthen the role of the state in our lives. And that has nothing to do with right-wing.
Coalition cooperation TOP 09, STAN and KDU, I would not be surprised at all, on the political map they simply belong together and, apart from the Christian or, conversely, the homosexual and gender aspects in them for voters in terms of the influence of the state on their lives, I basically do not see an obvious difference. However, the ODS has long been portrayed as "the only right-wing" and by linking it to these three entities, it is openly revealing its true political assignment.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the stickers. Have you noticed how often all these parties quite agree and cheaply refer to critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Or do they fail to understand that there are many who do not like Eurosocialism and growing non-freedom to which the authoritarian regime in Russia smells as strongly? Do they not by chance hide their complete argumentative incompetence and the groundless or blind adoration of the Euro-leaneucoma?
It is simply possible that in the Czech Republic, other than centrist politics, has no chance of more success. Maybe the voters really want this kind of bonding. Perhaps they want a left-of-of-the-mouth policy under the guise of the "right," because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or they can't even identify it). Dunno. But I am certainly not one of those voters.
The unexplained death of the little girl (†8) in Příbramsk: The culprit is not expected to be punished
Uncloudy cases are called "momaniac" in the criminal slang. But they, too, are being investigated if new information comes up years later. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. Criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prokop Valley in Prague, at the time, for 12 years. "A case from 1955? That'll be hard, very hard. It would take a start to find a file, it no longer has to exist, to talk to those who investigated. There is always hope, but it would be really hard," says Markovic.
Under the previous regime, the public did not report violent crimes much, but according to Markovic, this certainly does not mean that they were being investigated laxly. "It's always been up to specific people," the criminologist thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, although unfinished cases should not be shredded.
Lucia Bílá's father was not a fan of her at all. You won't believe what she was supposed to do for a living!
Who does not know that the national treasure of Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of seamstress and real name Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in a glass factory!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Her love of singing was born when, as a little girl, she performed at the cultural house in her native Otvovice, where the warbler still lives.
"And I'll remember exactly where my mother was. A singer was born in me that time," she admitted to Impulsu radio.
But her father was a little worried about his daughter's future, recommending that she follow the path of a trade that has a golden bottom.
"My dad always said, 'Rear a girl, a trade. Go on the ground with your feet!' He even talked me into asking if I wanted to go to the local glassworks. The glassworks aren't working anymore, I kind of. I'm a trained seamstress and make various rosaries and pendants out of beads at home, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs for money," she added with a laugh.
The launch of the new toll is not at risk, reports the Kremlin. But the operator change is at play
The Ministry of Transport on Friday started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. It is a backup plan that the state would use if the current toll contract was finally cancelled. In addition, the state is also preparing other makeshift solutions if it did not get to finish the tender in time. This was made on Facebook by Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO).
The Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) on Thursday banned the performance of the toll contract between the state and the CzechToll consortium, with an annual deferral. The Ministry will file an appeal against it.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are starting the preparation of a new transparent procurement procedure, the subject of which will be the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the consortium CzechToll and SkyToll," the minister said.
The state would thus be looking for the tender to the operator of the currently planned toll, which will be launched from this December. So it would not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to the Kremlin, the ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on the experience of the toll tender so far, I am deeply convinced that the OBR is mistaken and that it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex procurement procedure and to hand over the operation of the toll system to the new operator," he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the resort will also prepare a makeshift solution to resolve toll collection for a transitional period until the state has found a full-fledged form of solution.
The state is unlikely to take up the offer made to it by the current Kapsch toll manager in recent days. The Austrian firm offered to operate the current system to the state in case the toll contract was cancelled.
The Kremlin also reiterated that he believed a backup plan would not be needed. The Ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority.
The OBR issued a decision on Thursday in which it prohibited the performance of the toll contract. But the ban will not take effect until a year after the Office's decision becomes legal. This is not final and may be appealed against it to the chairman of the office. The Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare a new toll, which should be launched in December.
In last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator, the consortium CzechToll/SkyToll won. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for ten years of operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract, failing to offer over 13 billion crowns in the competition.
I still see myself as a boy who's just getting to know, says Jan Cina
"That was a big school for all those who worked on it. I fell in love with an afro dance there. The way I have something Romani in me after my dad, it has completely enchanted me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
Much more recent memories than the First Step series has a feature of the role of a painting artist in the new film, National Avenue. Cina revealed that director Stephen Altrichter must have been tempted by him a lot. "The work was challenging, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honestly, but also entertaining. It was filmed on National Mall, where I drove as a non-driver. There was also a lot of filming in the South City in Prague," he said of the Czech-German co-production film.
Although he is nominated for a Thalia Award for a role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the highlight of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a guy who's just getting to know. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the top far ahead of me,' he revealed, noting that he didn't even think about the speech of thanks in the event of victory. "Not really, but no way as a child, listening to discussion shows on the radio, I've always imagined me to speak to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To enjoy each other and see the problems as a challenge and a good matter for a solution," he revealed, reminiscing about the Czech Lions Awards when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it did. He wore new slippery shoes, and the red carpet was slippery, too. So it wasn't long before he was on the ground. He could make it a priority. He had a workshop on the Vanchur Steps, where he taught how to fall safely down the stairs at the VIP events."
The Dockers Zoo rejoices in a small macaque
"Our band currently has seven members. Her youngest member was born on August 17, a female Buffy gave birth to him and is her fifth cub, the father of the male Hitam. For the first days after giving birth, the female carried the cub firmly pressed against the body, and for a long time she did not want to show the world if she had given birth to a male or a female. At about three weeks of the cub's age, however, she has started to postpone it gradually for a little while, and the handlers have known for a few days that she is a male," said zoo spokesperson Alena Houšková, noting that the zoo of Děčín has already successfully bred 12 cubs of this species.
Maccak plumbing is the so-called endemic of Sulawesi Island, which means that they do not live in the wild elsewhere in the world. A typical feature is the black fur and plume on the head by which they have a name. Maccak plucky live in the rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. The diet is dominated by the fruits of jungle trees, which are complemented by flowers and leaves. The need for proteins is dealt with by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, bird eggs and chicks.
"If we nominate the natural enemies, which are the pythons, everything else was written down by man. Local residents hunt macaques as a popular prey with tasty meat and fur. It is fatal for these animals to burn and fry the rainforest," the spokesperson said.
Germany is reporting the first case of the West Nile fever by mosquito on its territory. It has to do with climate change
In addition to West Nile fever, mosquitoes can also carry malaria, for example.
Germany reported the first case on Friday in which a man contracted West Nile fever in German territory after being pinched by an infected mosquito. DPA reported the news. Until now, all the sick have contracted the virus while travelling or contacting sick animals. According to experts, the breakthrough case of the disease is linked to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute said the virus was contracted by a 70-year-old man from Saxony. His disease was in serious progress and was treated at a hospital in Leipzig for brain inflammation. He's healthy now.
The West Nonil fever virus was first demonstrated in 1937 in Uganda. In the meantime, it spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and the United States in the 1990s. Its carriers are mainly birds and mosquitoes, who infect their infected blood.
Managers of state-owned companies are to be newly undergoing a selection process. The law will be circumvented, opposition says
"This is a typical draft law that is unnecessary," said ODS deputy chairman Zbyněk Stanjura.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies approved changes to avoid opaque distribution of functions in the future - critics speak of tobacconists - in state-owned companies. Newly, candidates should go through the selection process at the ministry and will also be assessed by the Government Personnel Nominations Committee.
However, it is a compromise solution that the ODS, for example, does not like it, because it will reportedly allow ministers to make excuses for the selection committee to be responsible for any poor selection of state managers. Moreover, the opinion of the aforementioned committee for the Minister will not be binding. The news has yet to be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Přerov: Driver crashed near the village of Kokory: Died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident took place on Friday on the straight stretch between Přerov and the municipality of Kokory. The 28-year-old driver of the fabie couldn't handle the drive here and drove off the road. The car rolled onto its roof and he was wedged underneath. He did not survive the endured injuries.
"According to the initial information found at the scene, a passenger vehicle travelling in the direction of Kokory outside the road went out of communication, where it rolled onto the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," police spokesperson Miluše Zajícová told news server novinky.cz.
And where are the audience? Doha cannot be London
At the same time, however, it is a step back, as the journey to Doha, the athletics voluntarily and consciously renounced the stirring atmosphere at the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and the European Championships in Berlin last year.
Giant banners on the walls of the skyscrapers in Doha invite the "Name sporting event of 2019." However, the fear of how dignified its backdrop will be is growing.
"Tickets for the target are sold out for all evenings," the organizers say.
But that's too little.
The top gallery of the Khalifa Stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with colourful sails, which also depict the flags of the 209 participating countries. Athletics went to a territory in Qatar where it has no roots, despite its annual Diamond League meeting.
So let's not be surprised that only 50,000 tickets were sold for ten days of the Championships last week, although their price started at 60 Qatari rises, or less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set as a target to fill the uncovered parts of the stands at least half. That is why, according to sources in the British newspaper Giuardian, they allegedly (though the organisers themselves deny it) give away free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as children. Which Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAF Athletics Association, can also comment positively: "That's how we can inspire the next generation."
The wealthy Qatar has won the world championships in handball and cycling in the past, with football coming up in the 2022 after athletics. The oil-powered financial offerings will always be lucrative for the wealthy sports federations. That is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we acceded to it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we can't help but wonder at the fact that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletes Championships in the Arabian Peninsula was supposed to be timed better - and for a different year. The extremely late term, coerced with climate, is hacked by the entire scheme of the pre-Olympic year of the season and thus the preparation for the key Olympic season, which would normally start for the athletes in October.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for it with technological innovations, with which it promises an ultra-modern and attractive championship. That it's just 37 degrees? Already, the stadium area is artificially air-conditioned to twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built into the blocks, are also supposed to give TV viewers detailed what takes place in the athletes in the hundreds of seconds before and just after the starter's shot.
Sparta is really busy this year, acknowledges Hradec bek Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. In fact, Hradecky ice hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will go in Friday's game against the club where he recently played. But the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be similarly affected, although they have never worn the jersey of the Prague club.
"Everyone wants to pull out against Sparta," says the Hradec back before the 5th extra-time match.
In it, Hradec Králové will try to stretch their winning streak, which at the moment has three consecutive three-point wins. After Kladno, Pilsen came to the fans the most awarded on Sunday, Mountfield went for in neighbouring Pardubice.
"But we can't watch the games they were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them the same, if not better," the Hradec defender points out.
The Castle should not look back on last year's record with Sparta. They lost in three of their four matches, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. In addition, the Spartans management brought in a few significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what are we going to talk about, they are really charged this year," admits Nedomlel before the first game of the end of this week.
The other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in Třinec.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has bitcoins hidden and doesn't know what to do with them
Venezuela's central bank is conducting internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. It responds to the direction from state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to be able to send bitcoin and ethery to the central bank and then pay the bank to cryptocurrencies' suppliers of the oil firm. Employees are also studying a proposal to allow the central bank to count cryptocurrencies in foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to a minimum in 30 years. Citing information from four sources, Bloomberg reported.
The sanctions imposed by the United States on the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro largely cut off Venezuela from the global financial system. This has further deepened the economic crisis in the country. Meanwhile, the current crisis is one of the most serious in comparison globally, forcing officials to use a mixture of different ways of moving money. While Maduro's efforts to launch the world's first state cryptocurrency failed, continued efforts to exploit digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent restrictions.
Neither Venezuela's Central Bank nor PDVSA responded to the request for comment.
It is unclear how PDVSA came to its own bitcoin and ethers, nor how much of the value of these currencies it owns. The company has problems getting payments from customers by conventional channels, as the big banks are unwilling to trade with the sanctioned entities. Last month, the company received most of its $700 million ($16.6 billion) payment in Chinese yuan because the parties failed to find financial institutions to make the transaction possible.
PDVSA may not be keen to sell cryptocurrencies on the open market, as this would require it to register on the stock market and submit to an in-depth inspection, the so-called due diligence. Instead, he wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank and paid with it to the entities to which PDVSA owes. Officials at the oil firm believe that the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that could arise when paying cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoins and ethers are used to verify and record transactions by a decentralised online ledger known as blockchain. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are made possible without the need for a middleman. Few banks are involved in digital currencies because of problems with money laundering and client information related to them and complicating compliance with the regulations.
Cryptocurrencies after the 2018 debacle are experiencing a return to the limelight this year, owing to the expectation of their greater adoption by the institutions and the company's plan to come up with its own cryptocurrency. They still remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen almost 20 percent in the last four days, but has a profit of about 130 percent since the start of the year.
Neckermann cancels all flights, involving five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancels flights in connection with the insolvency of both the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., acting under the trade name Neckermann Travel Agency, did not file the insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"CK Neckermann, however, is forced to continue to cancel the planned departures of its clients," he added, noting that this currently applies to all departures from 26 September to 6. October.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect about 500 clients. The 800 Neckermann clients, who are abroad at the moment, "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic on their scheduled flight" is assured.
The travel agency admitted that some clients had been asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary for the clients to contact the CK Neckermann SOS line immediately," added Šrámek.
The collapse of Thomas Cook took place on Monday. Meanwhile, in August this year, the travel agency entered into an agreement on the basis of which creditors were to inject £900 million into the company.
Half of the sum was to be raised from the Chinese company Fosun Tourism. This was to become the majority owner on the basis of this. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor banks. However, as early as 20 September, it was reported that creditors had demanded the travel agent to obtain a £200m buffer, otherwise the deal was underway. On Monday, the company announced that it had gone bankrupt.
Under the bridge, a non-confrontational homeless woman was killed. Police are looking for witnesses
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the early evening until the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police appeal relates to any testimony.
"Some of the drivers, who were driving on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or on Pod Krejcárkem Street, could have filmed the killer on a dash cam, for example. A witness might have just seen him and might have described him. In short, we will welcome any testimony to this case and receive it on line 158," said the spokesman for the regional police Directorate, Jan Daněk.
According to a spokesman for Daněk, the homeless woman was unconfrontational, not drinking alcohol and seeking out the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene. "She most often moved around Krejcárek, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she was carrying large blue shopping bags," added Daněk, describing the victim, who could also help potential witnesses.
Slovaks succeed, only to pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association succeeded in appealing against the stadium's closure for the racism of the fans. The team was originally scheduled to play a European Championship qualifier with Wales without spectators, instead the union will only pay a fine of €15,000 (about $387,000).
The UEFA disciplinary committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of the fans at the recent mutual qualifier in Budapest, which the visiting charges of Czech coach Pavel Hapal won 2-1. Both unions closed the stadium for one match and fined Slovakia €20,000, while Hungary were fined €67,000 by Hungary.
After the appeal, the Slovaks were only fined €15,000 for insulting political shouts. The next national team match in qualifying for the European Championship with Wales 10. October in Trnava will thus be made available to fans.
Basketball players failed to reach the medal at the Under-17 World Championships, finishing fourth
The third World Cup of 17 was also won by the Americans, who beat Spain just 77-75 in the final, despite 40 points from Spain's Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the start, but we couldn't hold on because they rolled us under the basket," said captain Karolína Malečková. "Playing in front of such an audience was an unreal experience," she praised fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, taking an 8-0 lead thanks to two three-pointers and dominating the field for the entire first quarter. At that moment, he seemed to be reluctant to return the match to defeat the group stage 85-88 after extra time. But the referees whistled 15 fouls at half-time, and by disputed decisions, they helped Hungary back into the game with a 12-2 run.
"I'm convinced it was enough to put the other two or three baskets in, to run to 20 points, and we wouldn't let that happen again. But instead, our mistakes came. I'm not interested in the referees, but what we did wrong and there were mistakes that helped the opponent to catch on," said coach Richard Fousek.
"It wasn't the first time we'd had a blackout in concentration. But the girls are fighters, they didn't release anything and fought to the end. But the opponent was of a lot of quality," he added.
The Czechs were particularly in the game by Petr Holešínská with accurate long-distance shooting and the pivot Tereza Šípová. However, the top Czech scorer had a problem with fouls and missed a large part of the third quarter on the pitch. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they had already held, despite the Czechs fighting until the final seconds.
"For us the first five games it was very difficult, we turned the games in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. You could see against Spain that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to go. Because of our physique, we weren't consistent with the defense. We didn't play a quick counter-attack, we missed a rebound. And the Hungarians are of such quality that if you don't dig all together, you can hardly win," Fousek added.
He believes his charge holds a promising future. "In two years, the girls have managed to win the Youth Olympics, be second at the European 16-year-old's European Championships, and now they are fourth in the world. For our standards, it's a quality team with a good character and you need to keep working and develop talent with it. Now he is up to the federation, which the coach will be assigned to them in the higher categories," added Fousek.
The end of political tobacconists? The new law, according to the critics, will not help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to play into the hands of ministers to relieve the responsibility for the election while continuing to select their candidates.
Greater transparency in the selection procedures for posts in state-owned companies - this is one of the objectives of the nomination law. 119 deputies voted in favour. The law passed, for example, thanks to the votes of ANO, the KSČM, the Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through the selection process before the government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation to the minister binding. That didn't work out.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD are concerned that the nomination law will play into the hands of ministers. "Newly, the minister will be able to hide behind some of the commission's decision and thus not have a clear transparent accountability," SPD chairman Tomio Okamura thinks. ODS Vice-President Martin Kupka also speaks similarly.
The GOP Committee should reject in full the candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free, a minimum age of 25, and expertise should also be the main selection criterion.
The bill will still have to go through the Senate, and then the president will get it to sign.
Tough competition for the Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed is betting on a rich outfit, at what cost?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult-to-classify model. It is clearly among the compact SUV, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. This item leaves the larger Sportage sibling, which is as direct to cars as the Skoda Karoq, the Opel Grandland X or the Volkswagen Tiguan. Compared to them, the XCeed also bets on the more dynamic body shapes that, by slopeing the rear, can vistill remotry the world of SUV-coupe, popular in this part of the market especially among the premium brands Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
On the other hand, you can't just rank the XCeed alongside the woped versions of classic compacts, which includes the Ford Focus Active. Compared to him, the Koreans made a lot of changes to the bodywork, so whoever doesn't want to see the news in the shapes of the news may not be seen.
Unlike the compact hatchback or the Ceed estate, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don't expect a basic atmospheric 14-seat. The XCeed launches with a supercharged litre and also offers a 150-kW turbocharged 16-cylinder reserved for the GT siblings. Don't expect the sporting degree here. Turbodiesels 1.6 CRDi is only available in the mild-hybrid version, which means that the internal combustion engine is assisted by an electric system that helps with reducing consumption and emissions. From 100 kW it is also possible to pay extra for a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic in addition to the manual.
Soon the offer will grow by a plug-in hybrid, a variant that travels roughly six tens of kilometers just for electricity. The battery can then be charged from a normal socket.
Simona Krain: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucia White!
The day before the christening of the Fuck The Age calendar (translated M*dat of the Age) Simona Krainová posted her latest photos of her completely naked! "I was a little worried about people being convicted of being photographed naked at my age. I'm a pretty shy person. But so far I've only had positive reactions. I wanted to show women that if you want to, it goes on to have a solid figure at the age of 46. Of course, it's hard work and renunciation, but there's no other way."
"We took about three thousand pictures with Lukáš Dvořák, selected about a hundred and there are twelve in the calendar, so the rest is still waiting for their moment. It's definitely not the last time I'm naked,' the model, who even came to her baptism with a very revealing one of her baptisms.
She had an extended jacket from Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they couldn't be seen, so it looked like she had forgotten the bottom. The day-to-day jogging tightened her legs, so she can afford such models.
Simona was so pleased with her success that she kissed everyone she'd met at the christening. Husband, friends, even Slavic Lucie Bílá.
Autouncive brought voice of digital soul
All you know about obesity is wrong, proclaims the headline of the long text, written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. The provocative illumination then states that for decades the medical community ignored the facts of obesity and waged a fierce (and also useless) war against overweight people who not only marked public opinion but also destroyed a lot of lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes says at the outset is that from knowledge and knowledge of the facts to putting into practice, there is often a very long and tedious journey. He mentions the case of scorpions, with some captains handing out lemons, limes, and oranges to their crew in the seventeenth century, with the belief that they would prevent the diseases. However, the British Navy withdrew from the practice due to concerns about the increased costs. The clear effect of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then demonstrated in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the navy to take this into account. Even the seat belts existed long before the invention of the car, but it did not become mandatory until the 1960s, as did the first confirmed asbestos-related deaths date from 1906, yet its first ban came in 1973.
"Every discovery in the public health field - and no matter how significant it was - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices, and financial incentives within the company to which it was to be implemented," Hobbes writes. In American society, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and around one-third of children now meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV combined.
Meanwhile, obesity is seen as an exasperate personal failure of an individual who is claimed to be weighing on health care and reducing GDP. The fear of fatigue in the population is so great that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. The truth is, however, that diets do not work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight by failure, and two-thirds of people on a diet would then gain more than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes also describes the lifestyle and traumas of overweight people. Here, personal meets the systemic encounter, where, for example, faculties in the teaching of future doctors, devote themselves to nutrition issues of just 19 hours from the entire study. Which at a time when the 60 calorie process that Americans are receiving comes from ultra-processed food - that is, over-processed food.
In turn, as obesity stigmatised, is illustrated by reports from surgeruses where overweight people usually experience shorter examinations, doctors approach them with less empathy, and view them as more problematic patients.
But overweight is far from the American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980's obesity share in 73 countries around the world has doubled and increased in 113. And in that time, no country has managed to shrink and stop the increase. Absolutely none.
Brno Grand Prix? There is a risk of price hikes for tickets
The most expensive item is the freaking fee each year before the Grand Prix. This year, there was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The mass of people who come to Brno at the Grand Prix will spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with organizing the event, including the leaching fee," said economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the plant is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno doesn't have that many of the world's tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors there even from abroad. For Brno, it is as important as, for example, the Tuřany airport or the Exhibition Centre. And these are projects that are supported by public money," the economist added.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the past five years: CZK 682 million
- problem: lack of money to organize, an increasing fling fee for the Dorna promoter company
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- state of play: negotiations for a new contract to host the races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix is draining money from public budgets for other matters. But to a certain extent, it is a political and not an economic question," he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motorsport event could be even higher. In the game is the option of increasing the locking fee to almost double.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible terms with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the race. Should the worst-case scenarios come to fruition, I fear it is not realistic for the city and the county to pay the sum," admitted the mayor of Brno, Markéta Vaňková.
As the daily Equality has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno are also discussing the possibility of using advertising because of the difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix. "The condition of Dorna is that the ad must be placed in places that are not taken by the cameras. The selection of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, the company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor," Vaňková explained.
More money can also be raised from tickets by the organisers in the coming years. "We have to sit down and tell us what the cost is going to be. And we have to adapt the revaluation of tickets to that," said the opposition representative for the ANO movement in Brno and former Mayor Petr Vokřál.
D5 crash: Freeway closed by collision between trucks
The event was reported at about 08:00 at the 22nd kilometre in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for the freight. Passenger cars can go through the gas station," police spokesperson Michaela Richterová said in the morning. Traffic was restored around 2:30 p.m. According to Richter, the preliminary damage is at least CZK 2 million, the cause of the accident is being investigated by officers.
Central Bohemian Fire Department spokesman Petr Svoboda said one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other with a plastic granulate. "Due to the big impact, the vehicles transported were shifted, which firefighters had to first arrange against a possible fall," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, leaking about 200 litres of diesel fuel. Another 200 litres were cleared by the firefighters. The accident was called to the accident for the leak of the fuel by the environmental department of the Beroun City Council. The release of the crashed vehicles and the freeway were cleared by a private firm, which also extracted contaminated soil.
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha so far
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying failures for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the 800 metres heats and the pole-sitter Romana Maláčová and the hammer thrower Kateřina Šafránková did not make it through, defending the eighth place she had surprised in London the previous year.
The run-uphe inmate Vít Müller will take part in the run on Friday and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela Joglová.
Šafránková threw 65.46 metres with her third attempt and fell almost six metres short of her best this year, which she would have had to improve on the progress. Malthouse jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was above her strength. To participate in the final, it was necessary to climb the 460 cm limit.
Mezuliáníková, who reached the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the IAAF International Federation, finished in the fourth round in the penultimate run, and even a time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough to advance to the semi-finals. She was one and a half seconds behind her this year's best. "It was pretty quick for me, unfortunately I was fighting my opponent there on a bend, which kind of robbed me of my strength. I felt like I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped and had to start up again, so it was a little uncomfortable in this. I can't be completely satisfied," the Czech representative said.
She was glad to have beaten at least one opponent at the finish line. "She was really not well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she said. The fastest halfback in the heats was Winnie Nanyond of Uganda in 2:00.36.
In Doha, the best eight-hundred-year-old of recent years, Caster Semenya, is missing from South Africa, who has too high testosterone levels in her body, but, like some other runners, is refusing the treatment ordered by IAAF rules from this year.
In the 100-meter heats, American Christian Coleman confirmed the role of the number one favourite, with a time of 9.98 as the only one to get below the ten-second mark. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is seeking to defend his title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semifinals. The start was not taken by Nigerian Divine Oduduru, who is the 2.68, with the performance of the year's number two scorers and was expected to face Coleman, who has a 9.81 performance this season.
The excellent form was already shown in the qualifying of distance runners by Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría, who flew to a distance of 840 cm in the first jump. No athlete in the World Cup qualifying session in the last 20 years jumped that far. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's table with a performance of 865 cm.
French Oscar Les Misérables candidate to open Be2Can parade
The Golden Bear and both winners of this year's Berlinale, the Cannes Jury Prize and Jury Prize will be presented with the 6th annual festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes much more. This year, too, the Be2Can festival will bring a selection of the most remarkable and inspiring things that have been presented by the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's festival will be the French drama Les Miscerka, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly took the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar nominee. The premiere of the film in Prague will be presented in person by the representatives of the two main roles of criminal unit police officers, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also the co-author of the film's screenplay.
Be2Can will be held this year in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas, in Brno (cinema Art), Ostrava (Minikino) and Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2. to 8. October.
The director Ladj Ly's director's directorial debut was released and awarded at a number of other world festivals after his success at Cannes success. At the IFF Durban, he won the Best Picture Award and Best Screenplay Award, he was also shown at the IFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo, and will be released in San Sebastián soon.
As part of the festival, however, the audience can also look forward to the films Synonyma, Young Ahmed, Intruder of the System, Goodbye, My Son, Pardon, We Didn't Came At Yours, The Ghost City Anthology and the Golden Gloves. But they can also look forward to other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to Czech distribution: the sci-fi Ad Astra, the Joker, the Czech triumph of the Painted Bird.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
The vote of the upper house of the Canadian Parliament has for several days confirmed a well-known rumour: Canada revokes honorary citizenship to the former legend of the fight for human rights, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Barmany), who spent years under house arrest for her country to bring freedom to her country, has lost her honorary title to her share of genocide against the Rohingya minority nation.
The decision to take Suu Kyi's honorary citizenship was approved by the lower legislature a week ago, and the senators have now unanimously supported him. "This is the right message for both her and Myanmar and the world," commented independent Senator Ratna Omidvar on the decisions of her colleagues. "We must make it clear that the co-conspirators of the genocide are not welcome here in Canada - all the more so as honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian Parliament does not technically change anything for Suuu Kyi, it is only an honorary title, but it is a strong message for her on a symbolic level. The silence of a longtime human rights activist for atrocities, which the army of the majority Buddhist Myanmar has been committing for endless months in the Rohingya Muslim minority, is unbearable.
The fact that there is an officially organised genocide in Myanmar, and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the country's government - has completely failed in the obligation to protect its citizens, was recently carried out by the UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders who, according to the investigation team, should stand trial for crimes against humanity committed in actions that - as the report says - "shock both by the horror of their actions and in a huge scale." Suu Kyi and her leading administration, according to the UN, committed accessory to the fact that the actions of the soldiers covered up and released the fog around them by protecting the fog of lies - for example, that it was a "counter-terrorism operation."
After the arrival of Suu Kyi, five figures remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 49. imams of Shiite Muslims and Malal Yussufzai.
The developments surrounding the former icon of the fight for freedom and democracy were also reflected in the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where information about the atrocities against the Rohingya was added to the Suu Kyi profile and the parliamentary decision to take away her honorary citizen's title. "We also dampened the illumination of her photos on the tablecloth showing the timeline of the fight for human rights and are thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," the Canadian media quotes museum spokesman Rorie McLeod as saying.
The only thing that will remain in the current upheaval of Suu Kyi - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, given to her at the suggestion by Václav Havel in 1991 for a huge contribution to the fight for democracy. "While the current action of Mrs. Suu Kyi is regrettable, her awards will not be annulled," the head of the Nobel Foundation, Lars Heikensten, told Canada's CBS.
Microplastics have reached the human bowel, a study confirmed for the first time
Scientists have been confirmed with years of suspicions. The team, led by University of Vienna professor Philippe Schwallen, published a study that first proves the presence of microplastics in the human stool. While the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, small particles of plastics measuring between 50 and 500 micrometres were found in samples of all the individuals surveyed. None of the eight subjects were vegetarian, six of them avoiding marine fish, all drinking plastic-packed water and plastic-packaged food.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either produced directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are formed by the disintegration of larger pieces - are present in the marine animal, insects, tap water and lemonades; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the digestive tract of man was only officially confirmed. There were roughly 20 particles of microplastics per ten grams of faeces, and scientists estimate that more than half of the world's population will have them in them.
Of course, both layman's and scientific awareness suspects that this is not a good thing. However, humanity still does not know how bad it is - and the effect microplastics have on "hostive" organisms. Small particles can reach the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind and confirmed what we have thought for a long time. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate exactly what this means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, it is known that microplastics in the gut can negatively affect the immune reactions of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens to the body. And there is no known solution yet known than to limit the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. But that will be difficult - the first task facing the governments and the authorities will at least stop its steep rise. As for the plastic bottles, experts estimate that in three years, humanity will consume a fifth more than it does today. The current pace is a stirring million bottles purchased per minute. Every year, around eight million tonnes of plastic end up in the seas and oceans. Waste threatens marine ecosystems and contaminates the digestive systems of marine animals.
Some states have already moved to restrictions and other measures, Kenya, for example - under threat of draconian punishment - banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering small bans (a well-known straw) and the domestic Ministry of the Environment is heading in the same direction. Critics, however, argue that while such measures are pretty but utterly inadequate.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where's Meghan?
Diana was special in that she could grab people's hearts. In January 1997, she aroused a stir when she visited Africa and especially the minefield. The pictures, on which he is wearing a protective suit and a shield on his face, have become iconic. And even then, no one could have known that a few months later, the princess of human hearts would breathe a sip of the tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry scored a mark when he went to the same place as her after 22 years. He set out for the mine removal post at Dirico, Angola, and also put on a special protective suit, looking very thoughtful. He could not resist the memories of his beloved mother, whom he lost at just 13.
Harry had a speech on the spot, where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to neutralize the minefields and other explosives in the countries where the war took place. "The minefields are the unhealed wounds of war. By cleaning them, we can help the community to find the peace with which opportunities come," he said, also appealing to the rescue and maintenance of the wilderness and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopaedic center after his famous mom, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention it on the official Instagram account: "The Duke is honoured to visit a place and community that was important enough for his mother to meet their tireless mission and speak to everyone she (Diana) thought they most needed to be heard, even though the problem was not popular worldwide," the Sussex Royal Instagram post featured.
But the royal fans may be frustrated by the fact that he did not take such an expedition to remember Diana his wife, Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months). For both of them have had a separate schedule for Harry since Wednesday, apparently to protect them. After all, taking a little baby into a minefield, he doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to threaten his beloved family at any price.
Individuals. We don't have a reproduction, but we don't have to scare
Some words have unfortunate connotations, though they just tell the state of affairs. They include the word only only child. He refers to a child growing up without siblings, but he does not sound neutral. "You know, only child," it says, with no need to add. Interestingly, this trait has been borne by the "one-year-old" since time, back when terms as demographic crises were widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman is required to ensure a simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state achieves this value in Europe today. At most, France or Sweden are close to it, but the simple level of population reproduction is not assured by European states. (Within the West, only Israel is out of the ordinary fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman.) It's a situation like that made for alarmism. That's why it's no surprise when he is also sinking into the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, Maláčová: "The few are almost as many as two-children families," she said in an interview with the LN. But she neglected the devil hidden in detail.
Yes, it is good when the problem is pointed out instead of downplayed or ideologized. Like in Germany, where a campaign for more children is easily labeled fascism (in the style of "so supported by Hitler"). It is good to be reminded that many couples plan children directly. It is good if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (perhaps a weak extension of work from home discourages women from further pregnancies). But all that means, let's point out one thing.
If Minister Malthouse says "there are almost so many people," there is a drop of demagoguery. The statement was appropriate 20 years ago. Recall that fertility in the Czech Republic was last provided by simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). It then declined to a formidable 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty per cent, to the present 1.70 children per woman, which is above the European average. It is not enough for a simple reproduction, so the activity of politicians is in order. Only with alarmism can they take a little less.
Costa Rica is a champion in the fight against climate change
The title was given to Costa Rica for several reasons. For a start, a plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - but a lot of countries have pledged to do so under the Paris Agreement. The Central American nation, with a population of around five million, produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully switch to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 per cent of taxis buses or vehicles expected to run on electricity.
The official tourist organization says that already around 95 percent of its energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017 Costa Rica operated for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks.
The density of afforests also contributes to the reduction of emissions. The rainy forests with its diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist attractions. "The costume is a pioneer in nature conservation and gives the example to other states in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can boast of nearly 30 national parks, which, given the country's small size (51 100 square kilometers), is a lot. Rain or misty forests, coral reefs or mangroves are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, picturesque waterfalls, and you would also find several rescue stations for sloths.
In order to the planet. The Night of Scientists begins in Prague
"In Prague, I would definitely visit the Czech Technical University and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Medical Faculty, to which there is no access for the public at other times," advises Jitřenka Navrátilová, National Coordinator of Scientists' Night.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try out the work of surgical instruments.
"Then I would go to the CWU and watch the film Green Desert," Navratilova adds. Guided tours will also be offered by nine laboratories. The slogan of this year's Scientists' Night is "square-hand to the planet."
Attorney General reinstated prosecution of mother who manipulated daughter against father
Attorney General Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of her mother, who has long manipulated her daughter and disrupted her relationship with her father. She faced charges of abuse and endangering her upbringing. The district court acquitted her, Zeman disagrees. In a similar conduct, according to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a crime can be seen.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary in terms of directing further application practice," according to Zeman's appeal.
The Svitavy District Court first found the woman guilty last year of abusing the person in charge as well as endangering the child's upbringing. She and her daughter were creating a firm, even a sturdial, even in a situation where she was to be given to her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a distinctly negative relationship with the father. The situation was marked by the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to self-harm in the event of a handover to the care of her father.
The Svitav court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year non-permanent suspension. But the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman in appeal, saying it is not a criminal offence. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court after the Supreme Court had already ordered him to rule again.
The regional court found that situations where one parent is manipulating a child against another is not exceptional. It is dealt with in the custody proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or social protection authorities of youth. Only rarely is the solution to criminal law.
According to the Attorney General, however, the woman has committed both abuse and endangering her upbringing. "The accused was quite targeted when she aroused negative feelings for her father in her daughter, and purposefully affirmed these negative emotions. By such conduct, she not only pursued the illicit intention to limit or exclude the father's contact with the minor, but she must have been necessarily aware that it would provoke negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere of the minor," according to the appeal.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to refer the case back to the regional court one more time. The appeal implies that the child is now in the care of the father.
Stand aside, he challenged Schiller for the words about the opposition scum Czernin
"I find it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government to use such a totalitarian statement anywhere, much less on the floor of parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words caused a stir in the discussion of the draft constitutional lawsuit against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes, and the draft constitutional action brought up by the Senate was thrown off the table by the MPs.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There's not a single vote to support this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages like spending taxpayers' money here, hitting empty straw. And I will even take the liberty, I don't use hard terms, one of them to quote: It's opposition and senatorial scum," the Chancellor of the Exchequer said.
"These terms were hailed by the Nazis, the citizens of Jewish origin, and the Communists of their political adversaries. It is the rhetoric of the totalitarian, without a hint of respect for the man and the opinion," wrote TOP 09 Vice-President Czernin, who will compete in the autumn for the party's chairman with the previous First Vice-President Markéta Pekarová Adamová.
"I've been quoting one of the many reports I've received dozens of in the run-up to the House of Representatives. Their common denominator was disgust at the constant personal defamation we witnessed daily in domestic politics, which was also the main motive for Thursday's House session. The fact that someone applies to each other is surprised by the term," Schillerová responded to the Czech News Agency.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, a memorial procession accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students at the University of Ayotzinapa disappeared, and despite extensive investigations, the case has yet to be cleared up. The students were alleged to have been detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened after that, according to the investigation, but the students apparently ended up in the hands of the local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, reports APTN.
A memorial procession was held in the capital of Mexico on Thursday, with families wanting to express their frustration that the answers could still be found and explain the disappearance of their children.
But the mostly calm march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals, destroying everything in their path. Vandals were destroying shops and hotels, not complaining or destroying monuments, setting fires around the city and draining windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do his best to catch and asked the public for any information that would lead to the case being clarified.
Over 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but neither of them was convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, investigators allegedly were to torture the suspects, APTN adds.
Mahulena Bochanova interrupted the one-year detox and sins again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bochanova confided in the Lightning that she had quit alcohol. "On holiday, I told myself I'd give my old, garlanded 50-year-old's body a breath. I've given myself a deadline forever. I feel very rested, I have a lot of energy and mainly my psyche has improved. I haven't been well mentally lately. I get up better, I don't have a headache, I have more energy, money.'
A year's abstinence is said to have been enough and the actress found her way to alcohol again. 'Sometimes I'll have bubbles or quality wine, but I don't drink what I used to. I'll have one drink and have fun until morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also enjoyed non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," boasted Mahulena, who is still a couple with the Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theatrical season after the holidays and will newly enter the series Ordinace v růžové zahradě. "I'm ashamed of the first two shows, I was really bad, I was overtelling. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He is mainly happy
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) will not be afraid of any questions. On his show Call and Write to the Boss, he publicly comments on various topics. Nor is he strangers to the tabloid caucuses he glosses about, sparklingly and wittily. Though he wasn't laughing this time.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad report, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karl got sick and said it fair, without having to poke it around the tabloids. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And I would, of course, like him a successful treatment and, of course, peace of mind! The peace he needs now," the TV owner Barrandov said.
"I wish the media would leave him alone. And she waited for the news the Master himself decided to provide to the media. I don't even really like the various expressions that his old acquaintances and various celebrities think of his health. And I can say for our media that we will only address his illness and his person if he shows his own interest. To me, a similar approach should be considered by other media."
Young Czechs think they know how to do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
"It turns out, then, that young Czechs have a somewhat greater confidence in their knowledge of finances than the reality. Women and respondents had a significantly larger share of the wrong answers in this case without a high school diploma," said Jaroslava Palendalová, director of KRUK.
Their knowledge of financial products is more believed by men and young high school students or college students.
Young Czechs learn the most about how to operate financial matters from their parents (37 percent), self-study on the internet (23 percent) and only in the third row from school teaching (21 percent).
Questions about finance are consulted primarily with women with parents, while information online is more likely to be sought by men. The acquisition of information about finances from parents predominates in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Practically minimal influence is the prospectus of financial institutions, professional journals and publications.
"Once again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent the authority in all the main areas of life, is proving. That is why the level of financial literacy of parents who pass on their knowledge and experience to their offspring is key," Palendalová said.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 per cent of young people.
The young are clearly concerned with the question of whether it is better to conserve and buy their own house or apartment, for example, or to enjoy and spend the money, without saving and living their own.
The strategy of saving and investing in long-term tangible assets is espoused by 94 percent of those surveyed. This is true across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current personal income.
The strategy of the investigation is 100% held by people in a marital union with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, it is more likely that people living themselves and with an income above CZK 30,000 per month want to enjoy themselves.
Hunter injured in a fall from a seat, was carried to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident occurred before 7:30 p.m. in the top parts at the Devil's Mill.
"It was a very complex and inaccessible terrain, so we dispatched five of our rescuers with the proper technique to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for cooperation from the Medical Rescue Service of the Moravian-Silesian Region. Paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," Libor Kluz, a dispatcher for the Beskydy Mountain Rescue Service, described the circumstances of the intervention.
Rescuers found the hunter in a pinpointed locality with multiple injuries. He was immediately treated and then gently, but it was difficult to transport him on the so-called Austrian cart through the impassable terrain.
"Transport on the route of about a mile and a half was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore surrendered to the crew of the ambulance after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the commissioned chief of the Mountain Rescue Service of Beskydy and the intervening rescuer, a fellow hunter was fortunately able to describe in detail the whereabouts of the injured man.
"We have therefore found it relatively quickly. However, if he had the Rescue app on his phone, our rescuers would have been with him sooner and at the same time he would have known about the accident and its situation immediately to the dispatcher of line 155," noted Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with an activated rescued app should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
Zeman a monument-keeper - A man straining the constitution calls for law enforcement
Those who move in the camp-divided society and don't want to be completely fooled welcome situations where they don't have to root for their own. When he can admit the pluses to whom he otherwise criticises. For one thing, to make him feel like he's only oriented by the pre-arranged stickers. Such situations include a list of the heavily damaged monuments that President Zeman fences during his favourite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what it is. And who sometimes travels through the Czech Republic, sees a number of those devastated monuments - from the centres of historical towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or farmhouses - with his own eyes. Everyone suspects that demagogy can come to the floor of demagogy, too. That if we reproach the town hall for the monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it could be the work of the former administration. Or a privatized object whose owner is not traceable. The head of state of local politics calls for: "The Parsagraf of the Monuments Act allows you to fine the owners of objects who do not care about their property." But even if the owner is unseesble, it must be admitted that the president calls for law enforcement. Which even critics of his bending constitution should be recognised as a plus.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman considering all the details and formalities of the complex problem. But he's built for a good cause in much the same way as squatters he doesn't recognize. Two years ago, we wrote: "Despite all the swearing, squatters draw attention to a problem outside of current interest. To the fact that this or her structure is in a state of disrepair." And let's face it, the president is doing de facto the same thing.
If you come to the historical centre of Jáchymov, you marvel at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov celebrates 500 years of silver and minting of tolars (for the Americans, dollars). Why? They say it's because of the speeding sale of houses in the 1990s, officials there say. But how did it be that seven kilometres away the Island, the seat of the Shrouds who spewed the Jasmov tolars, has the historic core nicely repaired? It is good to point out these things to the President.
Babiš in memorial to the victims of the terror called for security cooperation
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monica visited the September 11, 2001 Memorial of the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, to New York, to Ground Zero.
Terrorism is the main enemy that all the world's nations should fight together against. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said so today at the New York City Memorial of the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001. The Prime Minister honoured the memory of two victims of Czech origin on this occasion.
"It's a very moving place," the Prime Minister said, as he laid a white rose on the names of Lukáš Rambousko and the Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová, accompanied by his wife Monica. Both were among the more than 2750 dead who were claimed by the hijacked aircraft attack on the former pair of World Trade Center skyscrapers (WTC). The towers of the World Trade Center collapsed after the crash, with a memorial in their place now with a name list of victims.
"It is necessary to remember what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. The attack on the US on September 11, 2001, was described by the prime minister as a reason for the UN to work together in a unified campaign against international terrorism. At the time, in addition to destroying the WTC skyscrapers, the terrorists crashed into the Defense Department building in Washington, the kidnapped plane, and planned to strike another strike on a target in Washington, apparently the White House or Congress. But this aircraft crashed when the passengers of the kidnappers were confronted.
"This is our main enemy, where all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated manner," the Czech Prime Minister added.
Slovenians also beat the Polish world champions to reach the final of the European Championships
The Slovenian volleyball players will be sensationally playing for the premier European Championship title. With the support of nearly 12,000 stormtrooper fans in Ljubljana, the reigning two-time world champions were 3-1 beaten by the Poles and are the first finalists.
Who they will challenge in Sunday's climax in Paris will be decided between France and Serbia on Friday.
The Slovenian team was much more compact in the semi-finals than the Polish world champions. They only owned the start of the opening set and the lucky end game of the second set, but the home volleyball team outdid the defenses and the players in the red and white jersey were basically scored only by the native of Cuba, León.
But in the home line-up, both the likes of both the Chebulik and Urnaut, as well as the second all-rounder, Štern, who soon replaced the unimpressive Gasparini, was introduced in the form of his life. The Poles paid for the fact that they had won all previous matches at this Euro, while the Slovenians gained confidence after heavy playoff battles with both the Bulgarians and the Russians.
With the Poles in August this year, the Slovenians lost 1-3 in the Olympic qualification in Gdansk, but were replared at home in the defeat. But now he will leave the sold-out Ljubljana Arena. However, they already have a certain second medal in their history after today, in Paris they can improve on the unexpected silver from the European Championships four years ago.
At the previous European championships, the Slovenians finished eighth, behind the Czech national team.
Technology companies want to govern our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history has been somewhat baked. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History, and the Last Man, "What we may be seeing... is the final point of human science development and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of governance."
Twenty-six years later, we are more likely to see, from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland, and from Hungary to Italy, to the more likely to be the winner of models illiberal, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism are thriving. Fukkuyama's current ninth book Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment attempts to cope with the onset of these forces. As his interview with George Eathon shows for the New Statesman, he rethinks many of his former views: he argues that the ideas of socialism should go back to the public domain, and Marx was very right about much. While he also insists that his thought development is still in line with the position of the 1990s, and critics of the End of History and the Last Man is said to have misunderstood correctly.
"What I said at the time was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that it provides peace and prosperity, but people want more than that... Liberal democracy does not even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it to individuals who feel alienated, don't see the point, and therefore group together according to the identity groups that give them a sense of belonging."
In its day, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who viewed communism as the final stage of history. When asked by Fukuyama how he now perceives the rise of the Socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "This all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about owning the means of production, then except when the public's clear services are in demand, I don't think that will work. But if you mean redistribution programs that attempt to address the huge income and wealth imbalance we are seeing, then yes. I don't think he could come back, he should come back. That long period, started by President Reagan and Prime Minister Thatcher, in which certain types of ideas about the benefits of an unregulated market came to the floor, had a disastrous effect in many ways."
In the end, Fukuyama is attempting to calm the current situation, and warns all the liberals that the emergence of new not-quite-democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
The soldiers are rehearsing, pull the curtains down. China to celebrate at the site of the massacre
The Army rehearsed the parade during the recent weekends. Shops in the center of Beijing had to close and residents near the square were ordered to close the drapes. Military cars pouring across the vacant streets to the square, and fighter jets circled in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters that they were proud to display their country's military strength. But one woman said it was hard to deny that the celebrations would be unsettled by other states.
She was apparently referring to Taiwan, which is claimed by China and where the election is imminent. But they may also be worried in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, in which thousands of people repeatedly demonstrate against China's appointed caretaker.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside of Beijing. The South China port of Xiamen had already put out a special light show on Thursday night. The Xiammen is opposite to the island's Taiwan and is one of the ten most innovative Chinese cities.
Before the anniversary, the list of forbidden things grows. It already features drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radios and radio-wave devices, The Guardian reported. He added that China's popular social network, Weibo, erases "harmful political information."
"This is yet another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the oar) despite all the predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who deals with China. "It's a moment when a party can demonstrate order, control, and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 when the Communists, led by Mao Zedong, won the nationalists in the fight with Chiang Kai's nationalists who retreated to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of a so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the Tiananmen Square regime massacred the tanks with thousands of pro-democratic demonstrators from among students and workers.
Since the late 1970s, China has increasingly taken over the elements of the capitalist economy. Councillors say the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) and (Dickens) capitalism (exploitation of workers) is now a mixture of the worst of the Communist Party.
Czechs or children's entry forbidden. Choi revealed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, erroneous information about prices and non-compliance with the principles of fairness of sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to let smaller children into the business. On his website, according to the CTIA, he writes that the facility is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "To the consumer's electronic inquiry, whether it is possible to book a table for four adults and one child at the age of four in the mentioned restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," Fröhlich said.
In the second case, another Prague business did not want to let Czech-speaking people to the table, while allowing it to be English-speakers. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of consumer, was not allowed to sit at a table in the restaurant and make an order. English speakers have been allowed to do this," a spokesperson for the CTI said.
Both cases are now dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they are not yet finally terminated, the inspection spokesman could not disclose more information to the said restaurants.
Discrimination, however, occurred only in a very small section of restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CHOI carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination, it revealed other errors in 64 cases. For the most part, these were shortcomings in respecting the principles of fairness of sales and not informing the consumer of the prices of products and services in line with the rules.
Earlier on Wednesday, the inspection reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged amounts higher than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, the final fines of CZK 60,000 have already been issued.
A holiday with just a credit card? NEO account offers withdrawals from ATMs around the world for free!
According to surveys, roughly half of all Czechs going abroad to pay directly with the card have become accustomed to paying for it. The main reasons include in particular comfort, safety, but also the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often associated with the credit card.
The convenience of paying by card can be appreciated by travellers in almost every corner of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, perhaps for work, don't have time to go to exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even the "vacationers" don't want to rely on the fact that the cash will suffice. Moreover, some foreign currencies do not even have Czech banks or currency exchange offices. With the NEO account, we have therefore solved this so that its users can withdraw cash from all ATMs free of charge, wherever they are," says Kateřina Petko, Director of Marketing and Communication and press spokesperson for Expobank CZ.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way to avoid losing money than cash. Losing a full wallet, its owner may not see the money he brought in it. However, if it loses only its debit card, it can easily be blocked immediately by phone or via internet banking. Thus, in rapid action, he may not suffer any financial loss at all. "Hiding money in a bank account has other advantages in addition to its reliable protection. For the NEO account, for example, it is an interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among current and savings accounts. Its establishment and administration takes place completely online without the need to visit the branch. In addition, the money in the bank account is insured up to €100,000 and the account is absolutely free of charge," adds Kateřina Petko.
For anyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility of arranging it and paying by card online, this can be done even at the last minute. However, the ownership of a credit card alone often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, for the embossed MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business cards, travel insurance is an integral part of foreign travel to all countries around the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with whom they travel. Often they are eliminated from any further arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always advisable to verify the scope of the insurance in question, i.e. whether it applies to all the activities that travelers plan to undertake.
We're looking for motivated immigrants. The senior clinician is building an international team of doctors, bringing their stories
Ledjona Toni, an Albanian, studied medicine in Czech, and today few people can tell she's a foreigner.
In the Czech Republic, hundreds of medics from abroad are studying to stay and work. To acquire some of them, a paediatric clinic in Motol, Prague, attempted to obtain.
To arrive at the Motol Hospital in Prague around 5 p.m. to get up to the Motol Hospital in Prague. A chicken woman with her short-cropped hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleymania, a city in the northeast of Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician at the hospital and is still treating small patients in private practice in the afternoon. He also teaches at the university.
Spilk in the par. In Indianapolis, he is on the verge of promotion after the first round
Golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of reaching the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she made two birdies, two bogeys, and finished the opening day at the par. With the result of 72, he is tied for 69th, which is the expected cut.
The 24-year-old Spilkova returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month health break and failed to make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She indulged in rest because of fatigue and exhaustion after a prolonged illness.
The first Czech winner of the professional tournament for the European LET series is a first-year member of the LPGA Tour and is not doing very well so far. She made the cut three times in 12 tournaments, the best she was in the 32nd in Hawaii. He is struggling to keep the card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was best played by Korean Hor Mi-chung. After the first round, he scores -9 and a two-shot lead over a trio of opponents.
Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, doing well for Czech banks, O2 or Avast
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight rise. The PX index rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45. It was pulled up by Czech banks, telecommunications company O2 or technology firm Avast. On the contrary, Austrian titles and the media company CME were not successful. This is according to the trading results on the stock exchange website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in a slightly positive territory and eventually ended with a small profit. "However, he lost slightly over one percent in the whole week (the PX index)," said Josef Dudek of Fio Bank.
The domestic banks have partially corrected the declines of the past few days. Komerční banka improved 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank up 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Avast's shares were up 0.89 percent at £113, and O2 posted 0.46 percent to £216.50.
Kofola's securities grew the most, by 1.38 per cent to CZK 294. Less than a percent was won by the tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares rose to CZK 13,640.
The securities of the energy firm ČEZ stagnated at Thursday's value of 520 crowns.
Three titles were lost - Erste Bank was off 0.87 per cent to CZK 779.20, CME 0.73 per cent to CZK 109 and insurer VIG 0.40 per cent to CZK 618.
The crown weakened slightly against the two major world currencies. It lost four cents to 25.85 CZK/EUR per euro, to a dollar three pennies at 23.62 CZK/USD. This is according to data on the Patria Online.
My heart is like a bell and a non-smoker's lungs. I'll just have some IVs, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent several hours of medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavorala, the doctors did not find any "church states" in the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
The president's doctors at the checkpoint revealed mild signs of dehydration. His problems with low pressure were caused by the inadequate irrigation. "In order to fix the dehydration of the organism, I will have a few infusions that will get minerals into my body," Zeman said.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the ÚVN stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president." The president mentioned in this context that Zavoral had received several hate messages due to a health check-up.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single spot on the body. "So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if they are not a smoker, the liver works as if I were a teetotaler, the kidneys are fine too and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editors of iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about her health.
The issue of Zeman's health became an issue primarily at the time of last year's presidential election or in some public appearances, in which Zeman has a clear problem with his gait. According to Prague Castle, the president is walking badly because of diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and is harder to hear. Because of his health, he reduced smoking.
Scientists search for toddlers with birth defect, so-called ankle valgosy
The valgosity (election) of the ankle is a birth defect that affects five to ten percent of children. By default, they are treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are trying to help these children even more, so they have developed special footwear that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes worn by healthy children and children with diagnosis to map the effect of both groups. Participation in the research will have no risks for children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimun, head of research at the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can report to the study via the web, where a registration form and all the information are available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children with a diagnosis and fifty healthy children. Of each group, half will always wear health shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should sign up for their child is the moment when they embark on the first separate steps, typically embarking on the furniture they hold when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the child's first steps, each taking about 20 minutes, and half of the participants also include wearing the tested footwear," Gimun points out.
Pitch in the pond, or a relatively affluent open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view of statistics such as good security (Czech Republic is the seventh in the world), a low unemployment rate, a low national debt. Or the figure that our country is, according to one recent study, the 24th in the quality of life of the 140 countries evaluated.
However, the developer Dušan Kunovský and the architect Josef Pleskot in a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and Development Summit also presented other, not so "pink" data. For example, the Czech Republic ranks 154th in the world in the speed of construction proceedings. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant builders' heritage, as was the case in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also the slow, non-performing bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic lags significantly in the overall quality and performance of public administration behind developed countries.
Our country has simply not yet been able to use the potential of the good economic situation of recent years well to invest in the future. While it is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, people with a better standard of living will also want to have a place to live, to travel in a modern and fast way, to have quality cultural stalls, to live without unbearable environmental burdens.
But for example in the capital city of Prague, for years, the inner and outer ring roads have failed to complete or build a speedway or a metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, concert hall, or a national gallery. The reason for this is not only the absurd tug-of-war over architectural competitions, land-use plans and building permits, but also a kind of specific Czech conservatism that adheres to the slogan "any bolder change is for the worse."
And when it seems that something more daring might work, it will almost certainly be thwarted by preservationists or other somewhat stubborn associations, or politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding the "block" of Jan Kaplický, designed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to the backpackers.
The list, however, does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is unable to complete its backbone motorway network, nor to start building train speedways, so Germany eventually decided to run its runways for super-fast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "track" through Bavaria. In addition, in shenanigans, repairs to existing infrastructure are sometimes heated. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is now a puzzle.
Babiš came to politics with a promise to "things to arrange." As for meaningful investments and the acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, much has not happened yet. As of 2018, an amendment to the Act on Accelerating the Construction of Transport Infrastructure has been in force, but we will have to wait for more extensive favorable impacts, for example, to be more favourable to expropriation of land. And the new building code, approved by the government, which is said to be to reduce the current average construction management from 5.4 years to one year, will start to apply from 2021, if we are lucky. But a lot of people probably wouldn't bet on it.
Unexpected wants 45 million from the state
The Ministry of Justice has received six applications in this connection in this context, according to the spokesman of the office, Vladimír Řepka. The teenager was in prison for assaulting the woman for two years, but the judiciary eventually acquitted him.
The appeal in the case was not filed by both the Attorney General Pavel Zeman and the Minister of Justice, Marie Benešová.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradecká prosecutor's office indicted him on the then 20-year-old student of the Grammar School of the Nečesany. The prosecution claimed that he had hit the woman several times in the head with a log and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by the doctors at the Hradec hospital.
Uncombed from the outset, he denied any wrongdoing. "I'm innocent, and I swear. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny that he had been at the hairdresser's address on the fateful day, said in court earlier. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after the woman told him that she was closing. He then turned himself in to the police as a witness.
The hairdresser did not recognize him as an aggressor at first during the interrogation, but later called the Aboriginal the Attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradecký Regional Court in the case gradually handed down five sentences. First, he found Nechesteaný guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, the appeals High Court reduced his sentence to 13 years. The unassumed man gradually headed behind bars twice, but each time he was freed after the Supreme Court intervened. Following a court orderly exchange, repeatedly acquittals were eventually handed down repeatedly, the last one upheld by the High Court in March this year.
However, the chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the grounds of his findings that this decision was wrong, but he said he did not have a better option given the procedural situation. He said he dismissed the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her appeals were justified.
"The problem with this is not that there is a lack of evidence, but an assessment of it. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was gathered in the pre-trial proceedings that would be more than sufficient in another criminal case for the admission of the guilty," Lněnička stated.
But the Hradec, as well as the Supreme Court, looked at the case differently, and their opinion would probably not be changed by the further annulment of the acquittal.
Epilepsy has made his love of sport difficult, with surgery giving him a new hope
For the first time, Honzik's parents noted that there was something wrong with him, in a year and a half. He would always look into the space for a few minutes, to froze, and not respond to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to a pediatric neurology clinic, where doctors, after a series of examinations, gave him a diagnosis of epilepsy and immediately put in medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of medication that made him completely stop having seizures. At the age of five, doctors withdrew his medication, and because the seizures did not return, his parents thought that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more to the sport. He cycled, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing with his sister and his friends. But he had another seizure at the age of 11, and it all started all over again.
Doctors rehearsed various combinations of medication, but this time nothing worked, the absent seizures kept repeating themselves. Having always stopped being aware of Honza in a seizure, his parents were horrified to get him in the sport and get hurt. Gradually, Honza stopped riding his bike and traded downhill skis for cross-country skis and snowboard. Although the sport had a seizure from time to time, he never gave up completely. He even fulfilled his dream and ran the Spartan Race, but together with a friend who kept an eye on him at all times to help in the event of an emergency.
When Honza was 15 years old, the parents decided to try to change doctors and contact the experts at the FN in Motol. After a series of examinations, doctors there concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgery to remove the lesion from his brain - the source of epileptic seizures. "I had to do two surgeries in a row, first the doctors injected probes into my brain that scanned his activities, then they could remove my deposit. It was a weeks-long hell for me. I just had to lie down and barely move, wires that were connected to the computer sticking out of my head," Honza recalls.
The surgery was successful and the doctors removed the rather extensive deposit. "The first days after the surgery were very mentally challenging, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and barely talking. In contrast, as he is normally alive and communicative, it was a terrifying change, but fortunately, after a few days, everything returned to normal," the mother describes, adding: "The moon and a half after the surgery had 1 seizure, but according to the doctors, it happens. It's been three months without a seizure ever since."
This year's school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sport, amuses him languages and has started working with the E Society, with which he travels to the schools for discussions about epilepsy. Honza has not been fully engaged in sports activities yet, he is starting to return to the sport gradually. "I'm learning how to play sports properly, how to breathe well so as not to put the body undercutting sudden stress, which is quite a challenge with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, she will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI boating triathlon, where the sick with epilepsy and healthy athletes meet, which takes place already this weekend on September 28, 2019 at the Cheerful Sandpit. But next year, perhaps.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kik, the office has allowed. But there's a catch
"The Competition Protection Authority, subject to the fulfilment of the structural obligations set out in favour of maintaining effective competition for the merger - XLCEE-Holding GmbH, on the one hand, and Kika Furniture and Lambda Properties Czechia, on the other," said ÚOHS spokesman Martin Švanda.
XLCEE- Holding, in addition to the XXX Lutz chain, owns the Möbelix stores. If the Kika chain were absorbed, it would occupy too much of the Czech furniture and accessories market. That's why they have to sell off some of the company being bought.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. There, too, the antitrust authorities must allow the transaction. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kiku last year for a symbolic award.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it had been owned by the South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. She faced trouble when she revealed discrepancies in her books. Kika has nine outlets in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been active in the Czech Republic since 2010. Alongside IKEA, Sconto, Jysk or Asko-Nbytek, and Kika are among the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The same owner has the Möbelix brand. After the takeover of Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about $114 billion).
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with a manuscript exhibition
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, from the time of the Roman and Czech King Wenceslas IV, can be seen today and on Saturday by people in Klementinum, Prague. The National Library released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed the rare originals in the showcases in the Mirror Chapel. Admission to the exhibition is free of charge, it is open both days from 10:00 to 18:00.
The exhibition of documents called Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and the Wenceslaus IV Library, the library was prepared together with the National Archives. The written heritage from the reign of Václav IV is viewed by the National Archives from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, its author Jan Vojtíšek said of the exhibition.
"Visitors can look forward, for example, to a work on the agriculture of Peter de Crescentiis, which is basically a kind of encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, a prayer book by one of the Benedictines of the Monastery. Jiří at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he said, listing the reasons why he said people should watch the exhibition.
Also on display will be the Epistle of Peter of Blois, where the semipemaker H (enrico) is depicted in the opening miniature of King Henry II of England. The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to the two volumes of the Václav IV Bible, was also involved in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see the Latin collection of John Wycliff's tractualion from the period from about 1411 to 1414.
The library of Wenceslas IV was not retained on Czech territory by a single book. According to the experts, this library was one of the most extensive and also most beautiful book collections in what was then Central Europe, because the young king longed to build a representative library to match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library died soon after Wenceslas' death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed in the conquest of the Hussite Castle. But several codes have been saved. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am glad that they are in a state that allows them to be displayed and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library," said the director of the National Library, Martin Kocanda.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition called What Plays Below will also be opened in Klementinum for free, presenting the local archaeological discoveries.
Kristýna Plíšková failed to reach the final, her second title so far misses her
Plíšková's environment in Tashkent was a testimony, winning her first WTA tournament here in 2016 and she was very sovereign this year as well.
After winning wins with Paolini, Kawa and Kužmová, she made it to the top four players.
But the match with Alison Van Uytvanck did not go well for Christine. The Belgian kept her serve and double-crokked Plíšková's serve in the first set. In the second set, Van Uytvanck soon took a 3-0 lead and Kristýně's turnaround failed, although she eventually managed to convert one break point. In the last she averted one match point, but the other came the end.
Petra Černocká changed her image and did well! In the bright hair she rejuvenated
The film Saxana Petra Černocká (69) looks absolutely fantastic for her age. Although she will celebrate her jubilee of her life in November, she never looked like a pensioner. And now she helped. She changed her image until her colleagues didn't recognize her.
Actress Petra Černocká never looked like a typical grandmother who wore her hair laced with gray paint, wore sedate belongings and went out sporadically to the company. She's always taken care of herself, and the older she gets, the more she can unwind in her view of her image.
Luckily, she didn't follow the trend of plastic surgery and takes care of her skin with good old-fashioned indulons. And her anti-wrinkle recipe pays off. But now she changed her hair color and saw through her.
When she came to a social event where the celebrities said goodbye to the summer, no one could recognize Petra. Not only did her hair have lighter and shorter hair, but she was still dressed in a yellow jacket that brightened her even more.
Ladies should learn from Saxana how not to underestimate that even on the age of seventy they can take risks with their looks. And it paid off for Peter, it looks a maximum of 50.
Traveller Sigismund or General Bocek. Senate handles commemorative medals
Boček, 930, who was a British Air Force fighter during World War II, thanked all the awards for the medals awarded. "The Senate was one of the first to remember and do not forget war veterans," he said, among other things. "The awards I received today also belong to my friends who are no longer with us," he added.
Kubera warned in his speech against the division of society. "Let's not forget about our roots, which we all, whether or not we want, unite and shape us. After all, it is from these values that our successful present comes from," said Kubera.
The awards were cardiologist and the most cited Czech scientist Renata Cífková, the long-time rector of Tomáš Bata University in Zlín, Petr Sáha, geologist, writer and traveller and populariser of science Václav Cílek, chairman of the Czech Biathlon Union and Vice-President of the World Biathlon Union Jiří Hamza and František Paštěk. The upper house praised his heroism - he saved the life of his neighbor and his two-year-old granddaughter in January this year when he pulled them out of a burning car. The medals were also given to former chairmen of the upper house Libuše Benešová and Milan Štěch.
Sigismund, together with Jiří Hanzelka, made a number of travel expeditions around the world, during which they collected a number of documentary material. Fištejn was also a commentator and director of broadcasting Radio Free Europe, now working with the public media. Steigerwald is also a playwright and screenwriter, and musician Kocáb was the head of the parliamentary commission for the oversight of the expulsion of Soviet troops.
The medal was given to the University of Economics and Emeritus Head of the United Nations Space Affairs Office Luboš Perek in July on the occasion of his hundredth birthday. By the end of the year, the same awards are to be given to the Czech native and the first US Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, and the British philosopher and political scientist Roger Scruton, who, among other things, participated in the activities of the so-called Underground University during the communist regime in the former Czechoslovakia.
The app will help equip workshops. For the points obtained by the movement
Furnish the timber workshop of the Hodonín Integrated School with a new hand-held tool. That's what everyone who downloads the EPP app to their phones can now be deserved by Help with Moving.
"By moving, you collect points, which you then add to our project's account. You don't have to be a racing runner or a cyclist, the points are added even when you go to walk your dog or buy, you go for a walk or walk to work," said Eva Schmidová, the director of the Hodonín school. The project was among the most interesting of the huge number of other applications for the ČEZ Foundation. The app will only be active for one month.
