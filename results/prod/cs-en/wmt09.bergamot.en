Prague Stock Exchange plummets into a negative at the end of trading
After the morning's sharp slump, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares reached almost half of the daily daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed up its Monday slump right from the start of trading on Tuesday, falling by nearly six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the decline in shares on Wall Street.
We also have a reaction from the market to the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives vote, which has refused to support a plan to stabilise the financial sector there.
Share Fall in Asia
Shares in stock exchanges in Asia experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices eventually erased some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng stock exchange's index in Hong Kong was off nearly four percent in the course of trading, but later erased some of its losses and the downturn reduced to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the Chinese stock market movements in Hong Kong, fell 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the Sydney stock exchange were down more than five percent, but eventually fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell 3.6 percent, according to the country's index.
"The timing of the rescue mission in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," noted the head of Hong Kong's monetary policy authority, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines monetary policy on its own, without depending on China's central bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Ruddo, US lawmakers should return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, he said, there is a risk that other countries will feel the effects.
The Blood Bath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was expected to spend up to $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion).
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
US stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, with major stock indexes marking the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, marking a similar decline as recently as 1987.
The index had been falling before the vote, but once it became clear that the bill had failed in the House, the index was in a free fall.
Congress backs down: US government may pump $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
US lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (around £12 trillion).
However, it is not yet won.
Indeed, congressmen must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final form of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
The Senate, according to sources, could probably vote on the plan on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor for a recovery in financial markets.
However, thereafter, it will be "cut-up" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms to help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: Plan must be effective
"We've made a lot of progress.
We have worked out our differences of opinion about what the shape of the package to stabilise the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be reached later on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson overnight on Sunday to give the final shape of the government's fund.
This should buy back from financial corporations for non-sale mortgage assets that pull financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the brink of a definitive plan agreement that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is hitting stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the non-Nazi Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
Indeed, they want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trading.
But it is not yet clear with certainty when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether they cannot strangle the negotiations at the last minute on a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount earmarked for the assistance of the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it is under the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, in a run of an additional $100 billion and later a final $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress in negotiations
While the president may veto this decision, Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to obtain funds to buy back bad mortgage securities, the value of which has plummeted, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, has remained intact.
"We've worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciated "an auto-party effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restrictions on golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the head negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed to the responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the breaks, the timing of the plan's financing.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for the directors of the company participating in the programme and sets up a committee to supervise the fund.
This should be run by the Treasury Department.
"We have worked very hard at this and have made great progress towards a deal that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also envisages assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayments for the mortgages it will buy in order to reduce the monthly cost of instalments for borrowers and allow them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patrio Finance's chief economist David Mark, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because it is not known by what mechanism and at what cost the problem assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will split the losses between them," Marek told news server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not that important, according to Mark.
"More importantly, this week's congressmen agree to support the plan and to consecrate it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the approval agreement is the most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together with 29 percent
The appreciable weakening of the two parties of the previous grand coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties were brought about by the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly strong losses, with the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, shaking gravely.
Conversely, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the strongest party in the country of the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 percent of the vote, but it loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the latest elections in 2006.
Worse still came the ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst performances of both of these major parties in Austrian post-war history and, especially for the Peoples, who triggered early elections, a literally disastrous result.
As recently as the beginning of July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the Peoples were well ahead of the SPÖ in their preferences.
But voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Speaking in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman and incumbent vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's bureau.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the still most likely way out of the election result, the renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-right populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ), and the BZÖ, with 11 percent of the vote - the Social Democrats also voiced concerns about the replay of the November 1999 when the People's Party agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was united, it was split from the BZÖ in 2005) in a joint government that even raised sanctions from the European Union.
This is clearly being determined by Haider, who has already said he is ready to work with any party and envisages a return to Vienna to national politics.
The Green Party was still in parliament, but it lost slightly and fell among the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
Apparently, none of the other parties surpassed the 4% threshold and did not make it to parliament.
Clash on a knife-edge: MP3 against mobile players.
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
This makes it clear that it is better to buy just a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to get a stand-alone player.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the prospects of the future owner.
It's probably hard to get a top-of-the-line, expensive record player to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such music products do not work on LP boards, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you are worried about vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues on your shelves, you are probably at least dreaming of such a gramophone.
It is the same with the music on the road, i.e. the music compressed, in simplistic terms - by the music in MP3.
Here, too, there are price and qualitative categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to bite the headset for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, with enough room for each.
The selection is wide.
It also determines battery life
Some of the top music players can do much more than just play music, but what most of the phones can do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Alongside the primary features, phone calls and texting, he can play music and video, record both, have a better one, the worse camera and maybe even navigate.
And taking into account smartphones and commuters, you'll also have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, no refrigerator can't barbecue, and no TV photographs anything.
The versatility of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Few mobiles can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually a lot less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobiles, therefore, expect them not to play for more than a few hours.
If you call for it here and there again, get one more charger for the job to be sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
For MP3 players you won't have this problem, even the worse ones last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted single-charge operation.
Another problem arises when recording music to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not every one can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be uploaded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards used on mobile phones without reduction.
For players, with exceptions (iPod), you do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobiles and players already create a music library by themselves, ranked by the name of the artist, album title, genre or, for example, user reviews.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories in the same way as the Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with the operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones are more good at
When choosing a particular device, be particularly interested in the battery life, memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of the control.
If the music is primarily a backdrop and if you only listen to it every day briefly on the tram, you just need any mobile phone that plays the MP3.
Which is already almost a mobile phone can do.
You don't even have to watch much of what music formats a mobile or player can do.
MP3 can handle all of them, and the vast majority of the music that reaches you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and, in addition to it, the vast majority of the devices can master music in the WMA format.
Less occurs with AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also allow, for example, online music to be purchased.
Just visit the relevant operator's (or other provider) pages via the mobile internet and purchase a song or album.
This service could already be a strong argument for acquiring a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and is mostly limited to speed-flagged radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this method of selling music (whether through GSM, internet or wireless internet) is being dominated by the music industry in the future.
Mobile phone is still carried by most people.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you find your mobile phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you also always carry headphones or at least wired handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that almost every mobile has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobile will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones normally cost under three grand.
For three and four thousand crowns, you can already get a very decent walkman.
However, you will be usually limited by the absence of output to regular headphones.
The best and, technically, the most equipped phones with a 3.5 mm slot for regular headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of players, among other things, is easy to operate.
The simplest ones - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by really everyone.
Minimum of features, similar handling to a previously common cassette player or perhaps a gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collisions in the form of an error-on-launched mobile internet and then a huge account for data transfer.
What machine to reach for
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually has a slot on interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the appropriate card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
But beware.
Only 2 GB of the base models are supported by cards with a maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativa, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
By capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, please reach out to specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus close to a stand-alone MP3 player.
The furthest is in the Sony Ericsson field, whose Walkman-series' phones have the same user interface as separately sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (trucially 15 hours, up to 35 hours), MP3 players will be taken away from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
Yet we are missing something here - a virtual operator to make the classic ones cheaper.
He may not be missed for long.
We have written about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe in Europe many times.
Indeed, this was confirmed by ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
Following the European Commission's latest actions in the field of regulating roaming charges, this may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding up so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to go into battle.
It may sound paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetrating up to 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, are happy to complain about the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák often chords in this, having commented several times in the past that there was no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network does not seem to have much of a chance anymore (after all, it would be hard to find frequencies anymore).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant price reduction, to which even classical operators had to respond.
At the same time, before the entry of the pike like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices in the UK as in the UK.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the Mobilking Virtual Operator in Poland.
In just half a year, the operator has managed to recruit more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
At the same time, the financial group Penta, which owns U:fona among others, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they only need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators tend to profile themselves as low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, but this is often counterbalanced by the narrower offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as much as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilelogisation in Poland shows, a bet on a novel target group can also be a pretty good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
"Chairf guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept could be caught up in our country in Poland.
Vodafone's press spokesperson Miroslav Čepický doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are founded.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Rather, the Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region," Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the financial group Penta, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
It has thus confirmed indirectly that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are certainly not in favour of this idea.
Rather the opposite, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hidden by the GTS Novera group for a long time, which would like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor to Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer field.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to make progress with some of them in the negotiations," says the group's press spokesperson, Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe there's a little bit of a look on better days.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to perhaps by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room for a full-fledged virtual operator to be created on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no entity has approached us with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2 said in his comments to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also invoked by other operators.
T-Mobil's press spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to be further built."
He adds: "It is difficult for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we'd have to have a concrete agreement on the table to be considered in this short term."
Vodafone is more likely to be drawn to meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says: "By acting with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial in terms of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, leading to a decline in prices and thus a decline in profits.
So why make such a competitor's emergence easier?
The fact that when operators are at a point, they can pull together, is also evidenced by the tune of the U:fona.
Perhaps the biggest pressure towards ČTÚ was at the time of the creation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
But now it is U:fon who is the fitting as an argument for not allowing a virtual operator to admit to.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive mobile market environment was recently amplified by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player would make high demands on him and, above all, his services."
However, given this approach by mobile operators, the sheer unattraction is the sheer disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
This is not just about the position of ČTÚ, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in competition.
These are exclusively owned by the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his typical stance on the whole issue.
"A virtual operator's entry into the mobile market would be possible after a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator to lease the necessary infrastructure were concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential bidders was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations Department of the Office of the Office said in response to our question.
The comments thus formulated will not be surprising from the representatives of the operators.
It is more from the authority, which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position in the market, it is more than a poignant one.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
But apparently the pressure to function properly in the market environment and the decline in prices are not among the interests of the OBR.
In fact, the shocking thing about the case is the touching juxtaposition of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is entirely self-evident.
Like the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is surely just a matter of chance and a harsh competitive fight.
"The office did not find signs of anti-competitive conduct in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, so it has a corresponding increased responsibility for its conduct on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are most likely missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his comments.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets produced by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of competition.
On such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - the consent of the network operator is always needed to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a segment, it necessarily has to be dominant.
But even if we did not allow this argument, it should be at least a warning to the OBR that the three mobile operators are doing strikingly similarly.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The upload of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a rather common trick in telecommunications, with the ÚOHS taking its hands off the matter.
We've met him in a few cases like this.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecoms Act, the extension of ČTÚ's powers to the field of competition in telecommunications failed to enforce, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the OBR must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right when no one's watching
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-ovtusstructive operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists of mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
They are usually companies engaged in multilevel marketing.
The mobile phone service itself is offered by the likes of Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator, ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, they will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar reschance.
"If there were cases of which you are talking about, it could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová said in response to our question on the problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such action will not be brought to responsible people from mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is opposed to such a procedure.
They make significant profits from the activities of these firms, and yet - unlike actual virtual operators - do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are used by only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot dispose of it fully as regular customers of mobile operators."
But that is what should be at least strange for ČTÚ.
In addition, another question is being raised for the OBR.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the OBR has relatively strong powers to expose such an activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the operators' explanation that they have no idea about this and their terms and conditions forbid it.
When we will not be the most expensive
As the text has already fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decline in the price of services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, the classic operators sought to hinder their creation more or less.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - too small, or perhaps too saturated, service quality problems, etc.
But it was in developed countries that the regulators intervened at these moments, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but in their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and another was packed on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are tossing the case around like a hot potato.
We cannot escape the impression from our experience that ambiguity in the competencies is more than suited to them in these cases.
But let's not throw a gun in the heater.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will really soon appear in our country, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OHS to remain indifferent to reject (discrimination) of other candidates.
And maybe we'll stop calling for more than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek ceremonially presented new recordings of the national anthem Where My Home on the occasion of Czech Statehood Day.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in the choral form and instrumental wording.
The singing was taken in by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem's modifications are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymen.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen to sing solo variants for singing the singers with young representative voices, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them and then also the choir were clear, that the text was well understood, to be judged," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home was first performed on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroup.
She gained popularity and people spontaneously embraced it.
The first verse of the song, after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, became a natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem is
Prague's public transport will also be on the chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1. October 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers will take over to the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at this point by roughly 100,000 people who own an Opencard.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (it will apply from 1 January 2009 and have to be uploaded to their chip card in the InformationOrders and Workplaces of the Transport Company at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be bought via the internet on the Transport Company's website www.dpp.cz from yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers by the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the outlet windows at the metro stations, where they still had to stand regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon over the internet and upload it to their Opencard in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these locations, passengers have a desk with trained service to help those interested with online shopping and also uploaded a coupon purchased to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard in self-service dispensaries, which are mounted in several metro vestibules.
What do machines like like that look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket markers and passengers may have already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická metro stations, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are five of them in the city now, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," Cautious said.
The coupon checks the driver's seat
The operation of the vending machines that will start operating tomorrow is simple.
Just put the Opencard chip card in them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which mainly come to the capital by residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"On the trains placed in the Prague Integrated Transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers to determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained ticket check Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which compiles the timetables of the Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built in the driver's ticket office.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the driver the chip card, but it is also necessary to attach the Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
This checks the driver for the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and will not remember when their coupon expires can go back to the supermarket dispensaries, where the coupons are recorded on the card.
Here, the validity of their documents will be displayed on the device's display.
Sudetenland wanted a referendum after the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans requested the inclusion of the Sumava to the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans were reportedly turning to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is clear, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter from the US president not to allow the return of the "Sumava county" - taken by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and want to be really sure of the words that the American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed in the words "People to whom the fate of Sumava lies at heart" reads.
Because joining Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans - in their knowledge of the Czech national character - hope only for the brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the US President's letter to take over the Protectorate for the present and eternity over Šumavou.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would admit this territory to a state to us a foreign state who oppresses and refutes minorities and nothing has contributed to the victory of the Allies with a near thing," the letter reads.
The reason the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the vindictiveness of the "Czech oppressors."
If the US president reportedly doubted the mindset of the Sumava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Sumava county of Sumava on whether its people wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses, it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans must have at least suspected that this would be about their expulsion from the republic, few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was a Builder German during the war deployed to the Navy in the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, they would need Czech," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted on the fact that they would be relegated from the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional campaign to attack drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, one could characterize the emotional media campaign that the Department of Transportation intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček expects her to discourage drivers from behaving himself behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the internet, but also on the flyers.
It should deter the driver from driving fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind them to be handcuffed before they leave.
He wants to reach into conscience primarily for young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "doesn't mean" is written in capital letters on the license plateau.
And then in a pool of blood, the word "pay" is.
This is to symbolize that one can pay with one's life in a moment's inattention.
Viewers will be "scared" by the spots until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic images of accident victims can normally be seen.
It promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and driver's whip
"The driver is covered by the carrot and stick system.
Sugar for them is that when they go for a red light, for example, they save time.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why information campaigns are needed in the press and, above all, negative ads, the psychologist says.
Already less effective, he says, are the boards that alert drivers to the danger.
"If a static board is installed warning of danger, it will probably soon merge with the surroundings and the drivers will not attend to it," Kořán pointed out.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke in favour of returning virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the Jediot Achronot newspaper on Monday.
"We must come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all of them," Olmert told the daily.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (the territory of Israel) because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would also include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want tractors or bulozers to run over his legs, as it did to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the premiere, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" that lie within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
That won't work," he stressed further.
Leaving the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's departure from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan," he cautioned.
"The Syrians know what they'll have to give up to win over to the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Speat Movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the sustained support provided by the terrorism (Shunt movement) of Hamas, (terrorist networks) of Al-Qaeda and jihad (holy wars) in Iraq," the Prime Minister clarified.
Schwarzenberg: Relationships with India may cool
If the problem with Czech scientists who were indicted in India for illegally collecting beetles could not be solved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister made the comments in New York after meeting today with his Indian counterpart Pranáb Mukherdji.
"If this had not been resolved, then yes, then there would have been some cooling," he stated after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said after the hearing that the executive could be too hard to intervene in the court's affairs.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjžiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls under.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kucera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mukherji to appeal to a higher instance, according to Mukherji.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the sentence to be free, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner made the same statement in the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can enter the matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already provided to them by the Indian side.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining with India the best relations that have a long tradition.
Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the Czech Press Agency, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake of the imprisonment and indictment of these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received the promise of the matter from the Indian party to deal with it.
"I've had quite a few promises," he said only.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In the wake of the tragic accident involving a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers could move on the bus.
"If we would like to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of the steward is in violation of the Road Traffic Act," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which was killed by a 22-year-old stewardess last week, was apparently caused by the driver of the lorry who crossed the bus's path.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, though she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even as the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with standing room, according to the licence.
If the bus is not homologated, the passenger must sit.
Long-distance buses Student Agency do not have standing room; which Aktuálně.cz was confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jančura.
"This is what the Ministry and I discussed and at first did not allow the movement of passengers.
Eventually, they called it off and came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet when they have their seat," he said.
The law does not know the steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation does not even prohibit the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the term of the conductor of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds Hansel, the spokesperson for the less uneventful.
On the contrary, the director of the Road Vehicle Traffic Department of the Transportation Department, Josef Pokorný, believes that the issue is adequately treated by the law.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed in the homologation of standing rooms.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing spots and a limited maximum speed limit, intercity with standing seats with higher speeds allowed and in remote without standing places with the maximum speed limit and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says expert
BESIP's transport safety expert Jaroslav Hořín, in the movement of the stewards on board the bus, does not see a major problem.
"There is not much danger in the smooth ride, the situation can be compared to service on planes.
Even here, it's not certain when the turbulence will come and the stewardess can hit his head."
"But should the bus brake sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on the city bus or the tram.
The safety of stewards must be addressed by the carrier by internal regulations," he says, also saying, from the law's point of view, the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel services
Student Agency offers stewards services as the sole bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The director does not consider their profession to be risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the stewards' profession is at risk, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers on boarding.
It would also save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in his cars was justified by the director of Asians, Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to the SA.
"We don't have stewards, we've been up against that from the start.
Sooner or later it will end in some kind of fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There was an immense tragedy
In an accident involving a regular service to Naples, a young stewardess from Pilsen, who had worked for the company for two years, was killed.
The Slovenian truck probably swerved without using a rudder from the breakdown lane and blocked the bus's path.
His driver tried to avoid the maneuver with a violent maneuver, but brushed the right front.
That two places reserved for the stewards' resting would be sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These seats are not available for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
With the girl's family's compensation, the agency will not be awaiting a court sentence, but he also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Adjustment of the law?
Not in sight
Clarifying the movement of the stewards on board the bus could be provided by the amendment to the law, which has been worked on by the Ministry of Transport's 30-member expert group for over a year.
"There was no concrete conclusion, however.
Buses don't even deal with it too much, rather a point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes Hanzelka, noting that bus safety security checks are under the jurisdiction of the police and labour safety authorities.
Czech Courts fight for seabed
It will approach the wall map, which shows Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
He is not interested in the continent, however, but by a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of staff at the United Nations Tourism and Law of the Law of the Oceans and Laws of the Sea.
His boss, the division's director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally adds.
There is work drive and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides the hitherto little-known world, rich in natural resources.
There is a search to be found of oil, ore and other mineral resources, but also hitherto unknown living organisms that carry the key to, say, developing a cancer drug.
A bottom greater than land
The coastal states began to enter the new underwater territories in a vehement manner today.
According to the UN convention, they are exercising their rights, which they agreed to do in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
It is under the Convention entitled to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In simple terms, behind the continental shelf is that part of the seabed and its bedrock, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the boundaries of the coastal sea, often beyond the two-hundred-home-based economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and expert technical assistance to the commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the latter three countries have succeeded so far," Mikulka adds.
The world's response was recently made by the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its undersea holdings.
But he also won New Zealand - the area of the seabed that the commission admitted to him last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profit that will flow through to them from the use of the seabed in the future will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states will submit their applications in turn.
They can do so until they did ten years from the time they ratified the "m sorry from Montego Bay."
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area, declared a "common heritage of mankind" is established by the Covenant.
Here no more state has an exclusive status.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by the Convention by an international institution established.
"The sea floor, however, is no Klondajk," director Mikulka says on the pitch, noting that his "unitemary areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contractually enshrined."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are sharing them with other states of the former Eastern Bloc as part of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal."
It received the status of a so-called "pioneer investor" in 1991, as well as by investors of a few other states, under the convention.
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The investor-distaged area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rugged, it's a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"It can be mined in an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian division official Rober Sandev brings one such concession to the demonstration.
It resembles a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the fabled shemage who, according to legend, revived the Golem.
Düsseldorf's Hope is Frankfurt
Big words in the WestLB board's letter to the employees of this bank are not lacking.
By combining the units of this Düsseldorf money institution with Frankfurt's Deka-Bank, "central institutions of the financial group of savings banks will be created for the capital markets trade," we will read in a letter that became public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring a "series of competencies" providing long-term returns into this transaction.
And, he said, such a merger could be a decisive impetus for further association in the provincial bank sector.
Such texts are made when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the Landtors' Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
Nevertheless, the link between Deka-Bank, which the savings bank customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever the kind it may be, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, said at the presentation of his half-year results at the end of August that he did not see the point of fusing his Mainzer Landstraße banking house with any of the country's banks, such as Helaba Bank or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of Deka-Bank, backed by one half of the Landesbank and the other by the savings banks, has commissioned the board of directors to conduct interviews with the WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be business in the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, the financiers say.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, has not been discussed for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it looked as if Deka-Bank's merger with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba Bank.
This triple-year thing was nothing after all.
Shortly after the merger's plans became public, the Hessen provincial government spoke out against the participation of Helaba Bank.
The two remaining banking houses did not come together either.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was acquired by the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg of Stuttgart.
Even so, there was repeated speculation about the merger of Deka-Bank with the Landesbanks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba Bank, the chairman of Helaba Bank's board of directors, commented on speculation about the merger of his financial house with others.
However, it seems to be making it clear, independently of this, that bringing together the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the provincial assembly in Bavaria, BayernLB's merger with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could begin to form up.
That's not really good news for Helaba.
If the pressure to further mergers were to mount, it is gradually losing potential partners for such a merger.
In the south, it would play only the second fiddle despite the fact that it has faced a financial crisis significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The link with the WestLB was banned earlier in the year by the Hessen-Thüring Banks' Union of Savings Banks and the Sire Bank, which has an 85% stake in Helaba.
This would be the only way to consider Nord LB.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one party to the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions are tuning together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the provincial banks, the German Association of Savings Banks and Sire Banks has not yet answered.
It could also end up being the layout of the WestLB, which, of course, is not wanted in this institution.
That is why, in a letter from the local board of directors, they are talking about trying to make a "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect the individual components to Deka-Bank will tell.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the 'weekend with the Italians'
It's the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so things will be different, she says.
Behind them, at the five-litre Kaiser barrel, there is a stronger bearded man, and two hundred tourists on Oktoberfest demonstrate how deep the tones can pass on his throat.
Elena slaps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova Station, there will be four buses with the designation "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" at 23.45 this evening, the expected arrival of 6.30.
The three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, with exclusively Brazilians on one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, having already celebrated at night.
And so loudly, says Marco Guarda, this is not for the Italians.
Marco, wearing a long coat with a fume imitation sucker and glasses with wide silver rims, the three buses belong.
He has been riding with them for five years at Oktoberfest, hosting three expeditions this year alone.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 10:30 p.m. left back.
Overnight would mean only unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast to the Kaiser, brewed exactly under the Bavarian Law on the Perile Purity of Beer, Health Insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco went to a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses go out into the night, on the autostrada in the direction of "Brennero".
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus quickly silences, the passengers sleep.
They do well, they'll need their powers.
They are being built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where a few other buses with Italian license plates are taking one more break on the number 8 motorway just before Munich.
When Marc's group finally arrives at a parking lot near Theresienewiese at 6:30 a.m. as scheduled, there are already about 50 more buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are being collected, Marco has her last speech, explains the attack plan.
One: Put on a yellow beanie.
On it, it says "Oktoberfest" on the left, next to the internet address of Marc's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so that you don't get in the way, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, spread out across the space!"
Maz costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Tell the Secretives, show us that we behave.
Once you've left your seats, they're gone!'
Three: "Tonight at 10:30 p.m. today, be here again!" Understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with the beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs on yellow caps like tree markers, signs and even an election poster of one of the big Bavarian parties.
You need to prepare for the retreat.
As a "weekend with Italians" he is known for the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Precise figures for the number of visitors are not available; they are talking about the fifty thousand of those who set off across the Alps and fall into the beer tents, ten per cent of all visitors this weekend are said to have arrived from Italy.
The Munich police line will be reinforced by seven police officers from the South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which is conducting a national statistic in which Italians take first place to the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments.
It is especially popular with the Italians Hofbräu tent.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
As recently as last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
Good thing this politician used the word "relatively" and the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared the crisis development in its claim.
For that one came up the previous weekend.
Index Dax, the monitored financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a multi-billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit assistance in question would go up to 35 billion euros.
The interest will only have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) on the amount actually spent.
The money is said to come from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary of Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, this state financier refinanced himself in an extremely short-term short term refinance for the long-term projects for which he lent money, which is no longer possible now due to mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve shrunk by 95% to €2.37 million, and the equity share of equity slightly down from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial trades fell to zero compared to last year, revenues from the increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as the cancellation of reserves for credit trading, fell by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher returns on compensation for subsequent settlement costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest under the Tax Code and for brokering trade for the group businesses, the 16% decrease still moderate on the revenue side.
The former state financier was burned on mortgages for sole traders after his privatisation in 1990, which were then set aside from the portfolio of services and further led by Aareal Bank.
As there was too little profit in classic state funding, Depfa was then more heavily involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects by private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now write something off the value of its subsidiary, and these depreciations will have a "crucial material effect" on the calculation of the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have been vaguely heard.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
It was already cut back by two-thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier for state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of the Def.
It depends more heavily on refinancing in the interbank market more strongly than other institutes because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, a spring of interbank loans virtually dried up two weeks ago as banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a year for part of the Depfa loan portfolio - around 50 billion euros - short-term funding.
According to a report by Hypo Real Estate, the financial need of the group is covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the firm is protected "behind the influence of international money markets at the moment to a large extent of incompetent functions."
Other sources have been told that this money has provided refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group on the market is now assured.
This is what the bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But given the dynamism and elusiveness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely impossible that the loan would not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appeared to be facing insolvency late on Sunday in the afternoon, it cannot, if a preliminary, salvation be calmed down by the passion.
The share price plummeted 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond rates were well held.
While preferential debts have barely moved, secondary bonds rates are being lost more significantly.
This is particularly true of the bonds of the former subsidiary company Württemberg Hypo and, logically, the bonds with the maturity after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Est's obligligations originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability is needed after a significant sharpening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it to the company by taking over the Depf, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as emission banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the reimbursement of securities within their due period.
But there may also be what almost no one dares to hope at the moment - the financial crisis will be over for the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become mere legitimate hope.
This is likely to set up especially long-term creditors with a series of sleepless nights, when they will decide whether to relinquish their commitments.
Short-cut investors can use the marginal line to at least create a loss transfer from previous accounting periods to the exchange rate yields of later years for the purpose of the future payment of the capital gains tax.
German special deployment units were in the freeing of the hostages
The Egyptian government asked for help from Germany in the resolution of the hostage crisis - the experts arrived.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were ready, but the deployment did not take place.
More details of the circumstances of the liberation of the eleven in Egypt of the kidnapped European tourists are gradually becoming public.
The rescue effort was indirectly involved in the rescue effort, according to data from the ministries of defence and interior.
According to the ministries, both Federal Army experts and the German police counterterrorism group, the Federal Police Squadron, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the Logistics Department from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were at the site of the liberation.
However, according to another statement by the speakers of both ministries on Monday afternoon, there was no need for German forces because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that didn't happen," said one of the spokesmen of the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, as well as eight of their Egyptian guides on 19 September in the south of Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert region in the south of Egypt, hostages were moved in the border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the acquittal or possible payment of the ransom.
By now, the rescued ones are fine in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages was in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of his release.
There is not yet any information available in Berlin to return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, all five tourists should fly out with special forces with one of the Airbus of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the Secret of the Box Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is to present herself on her first day at Tachibana High School, the girls start to sniff themselves: the German woman is a complete "kawaii"!
What's that mean?
Sylvana knows that word from mang. On his new blog about the exchange, he talks about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already scared from my trip to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train to the middle in Tachibana for 40 minutes.
I had to find the trip myself, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the start of teaching on Tachibana is not given as strictly as it is at our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and a short sit-down with the teacher, the so-called 'home room' begins.
But even before the classroom started, I should have introduced myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Having not yet had a school uniform, I wore an old skirt to my host's mom, plus a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
So dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sajonara Wo She Says Sylvan's...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and it's my birthday in a week's time.
At that point, I was so glad to start learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I could still hear the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangles.
It is one of the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls' survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, considering it an honor that a foreign student should have been sitting next to her.
The rest of the class was relatively calm, but when the gong came in, they literally showered me.
They spoke in one's length and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
Then, during the break, they all unpacked their benta.
My host mum made me a lunchbox like this, too - and that's different from boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber and eyelashe lettuce, fruit and a kind of fish in the tofu batter.
I usually have no idea what exactly I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, br!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a handmade bento, which in this case is particularly artistically groomed, and hopes to get to know the boy closer to a snack at a break.
I read about that in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Because it just fascinates me.'
After all, I've been prepping mangoes for years.
And to get to understand these comic books and their culture better, I started learning a little bit Japanese once.
So it was very clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a soft spot for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the countries of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen.'
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the US Congress let a $700 billion rescue package for financial markets fall by a narrow majority.
The Dow Jones index suddenly plummeted.
By a margin of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial market bailout package.
Despite all the calls from US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both sides did not find a majority for a program that should ease the chaos in the financial markets.
The dramatic action was desperately sought to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on the MP to give his consent before the vote, although, as he put it, the plan was not popular.
"It's hard to get political appreciation for avoiding something that hasn't happened at all," he acknowledged.
Earlier in the vote, the Dow Jones plummeted by more than six percent, or 600 points.
This was due to investor concerns that the state rescue package could be forfeit.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the index's value was raised to fall steeply after the announcement of the package's shipwreck.
Experts are now counting on more serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is needed.
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach is running away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify whether they feel the same thing when they behave in the same way as we do?
The online magazine "Edge" has been published for several years by posts by well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we start to pursue a different kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter the impassable terrain because the hardware does not coincide.
When a rat gets into danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: pretending to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
Humans behave in the same way, from which some scientists suggest a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that, however.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to experiencing animals.
This is both because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the side-farming cortex (because of its share of short-term memories and executions or management functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than other primates, and other creatures seem to be completely absent from other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is a reason to believe that one is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be concealed by a person's linguistic nature: because such much of his perception is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if consciousness didn't matter to the language, surely the language would have influenced it, so that the animal consciousness, however constructed it is, would probably be distinguishable from most of the states of our consciousness.
It is therefore difficult to see what the consciousness in other animals may look like.
When, as something indoor and subjective, it is neither to be measured nor, for the sake of the special hardware, to be analysed on the basis of our own experience, examining it to us in the face of major problems.
Most of my outlets relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine the processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in the short-term memory studies of primates, especially on the example of visualisation.
But this approach, addressed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on the neural correlates of consciousness than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but perhaps they are not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of a non-treptical chutex for the implementation of the visualization.
What does this imply for feelings?
I infer them from the fact that an emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or the consequences of it, such as bodily responses) uses the memory.
Seen from this angle, the feelings are closely intertwined with those areas of the Cortex that characterize primates, and especially humans.
In the connection with linguistic nature, a subtle graduation of perception arises, because by means of words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize states in order to add them to others alongside themselves.
By contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain stem of physical feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, is more focused on the brain stem.
Since the network has not changed much during the course of human evolution, it could well participate in the feelings perceived by multiple animal houses.
In theory, I cannot oppose it, but I find this unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what seems to us to be fear for rats and humans is probably felt by both organisms in the same way: But how can it be verified, says Pankseep, whether rats and people feel the same thing when they behave in the same way?
The cockroach flees the danger - does he feel fear, too?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of the conduct cannot prove the coincidence of experience.
It is true that a neural comparison moves us on: rats and humans have similar brain tribes, while cockroaches and the brain.
But is the brain strain responsible for the feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in humans: how would we like to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (whoever know?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and the tongue), I think of emotional behavior rather than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we may see progress at the neural level if we measure the same for rats and people.
As with rats I do not examine the language and consciousness, I don't even examine the feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It is possible to think it is short-sighted, but I move forward rather than rush repeatedly against the wall.
I'm a practical emotional person.
UEFA President Platini: Pardon Time-limits for Poland and Ukraine
The acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasulynyk said the preparations would soon be run directly by the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the European Championships together with Poland," Vasuynyk said.
"It's not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just started and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early fulfilment of the timetable for the construction or redevelopment of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the European Championships will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work now as quickly as possible," said the chairman of the Ukrainian Union, Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep following us."
An even more radical move was agreed in Poland.
The management of the Polish PZPN union was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport, Mirosław Drzewiecki.
He said there is "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish press PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini by letter that this step will not suffer from the preparation for the 2012 European Championships."
Several teams from the first league were doomed to a forced descent in the previous season due to manipulations, and in the end the start of the league had to be moved in a hurry.
Travel agents record rising numbers of bookings
It looks like winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, the trip bookings for the next months increased significantly in the comparison with the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans' appetite for travel remains unlucky.
For the winter season bookings, travel agents recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Union (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) said in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Survey Institute, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
The turnaround was thus about eleven percent higher for October compared to 2007 compared to 2007.
The basis for these results are the GfK numbers, which annually assesses the booking data of the 1,200 German travel agents and interpolates them to the overall market.
Included in this result were bookings of the tours, which took place until the end of August 2008.
The weak dollar exchange rate is mainly in demand for travel to the US, DRV said.
For these trips, the addition of reservations makes about one-third.
In addition, the Germans are particularly desirable targets for Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
In particular, the organised tours are on course, said DRV chairman Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising expenditure of energy and food, the cost is "imaginable for the client than for the client's individually organised holiday."
Laepple explained that consumers can save money by making savings by making, among other things, discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so a higher turnover will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who made some travel has declined compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new movie, talked about private things in an interview - and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan referred to her former Dennis Quaid as a matrimpie.
He's furious and strikes back.
The belated Rose War of the Above Marriage Pair of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are in a messy feud - in the public eye.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "The renderer of the day was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she only learned of the scale of the fraud after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film, "The Women," which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was distinctive: It's "crazy," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews down the history of our relationship and edits it."
Moreover, it is "political" that the joint 16-year-old son of Jack once again "reiterates to the public about the pain and the radical changes that divorce for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of the twins.
He concludes his reflections on the sagging: "My life goes on, anyway.
I consider it a happy one to have an amazing family that is doing great."
Prices of tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than the year before.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its bookkeeping data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant decline in the second quarter after the first-rate rise in prices.
After prices on the hotel market had risen for several years, accommodation in many places had already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed were still rising by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most obvious in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express considers the cause of this trend to be the dollar's weak exchange rate, which has prompted the "declining appetite for American tourists to travel."
The drop in hotel prices was also more heavily affected by financial centres than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices, by their rise of 26.3 percent, even set a European record.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
To increase kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, fares in Economy-Class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the changes were noticeably less pronounced in the Business and First-Class classes.
In Germany, prices have plummeted even more sharply than in other European countries:
They grew 11.9 percent from January to March, down 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, according to the cited study, prices fell by as much as half.
One of the reasons for this price crash is slowing economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand in many air transport market segments is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies agreement, which has liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable routes by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - there were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1-0
With one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to form a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - to enlarge the Failed Landing for Representative Marko Marin.
This player from Gladbach did not join the game until late and failed with a balloon-stick-laced ball.
His report was precision-formed, and it was convincingly from his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the Hamburg Arena's booths.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break between halftimes ended and most people sat in their seats again.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist for the HSV for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many of the momentary actor.
And so his plea was also beheed in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave up his thumb as a sign of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His orders were probably the same: with the second goal!
The execution did not happen.
"It wasn't nice to meet here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "wanter relaxed."
The Hamburgers owe 1-0 (1-0) to the header of Mladen Petrić (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbashans could not harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence this Monday.
Viewers were celebrating themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and a live updated slate on a video wall in which their team was listed as the premier.
It'll be a birthday without a big party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the interim table result symbolizes the league's unpredictability rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petrić and the FC Bayern, won't be found - he is slow to be able to shine, but he can't shine yet.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
My First Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated ash, a drowco beer and a pennies in costumes from well-known designers.
First time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV presenter, and she wears a tailor-made costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we're not even three minutes in a beer meadow yet, and we're already being hailed by photographers and swiftly filling up with memory cards - I'm flattered, it's my first time at Oktoberfest.
This is how you can make friends.
It seems my cheap costume has served its purpose.
I am here as a tourist and live north of the sausage equator, and so my feeling of comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But as soon as he arrived at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing female costume or leather trousers; no one is looking disgusted or embarrassingly hurt - everything is perfectly normal.
The strange views at the chocolate-covered banana stall are only my apron.
A Munich woman points out to me that I have misconstrued her: "You are free, in the middle of a virgin, entered on the right, widowed at the back."
I'll throw in the bow from behind to the left.
"All right," he says, and laughs.
Others don't worry so much about the sublime flirting techniques, and they're wearing simple felt hats that read "To drunk to get got dressed!" and stick out on the bystanders' naked asses.
A young man with such an exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he's from England, and he came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds "gorgeous," with an extended "ōo."
This is what he tells me after he relieved himself of a drunk wimmade.
Right next to one of those hydrants, who everyone thinks is trash cans.
Bob is therefore one of the feared "Wildbieslers," as they are called in public in public by free-flowers in Bavaria.
The rest of the happiness to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around the 8 p.m. they run around the area where Oktoberfest takes place, in droves of medics who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - four of them wear a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to the beer meadow: empty there, full back again.
Those who lie under the sailing of this coffin of the pardon cannot be seen.
"That so te that can't go on," one of the medics calls me in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
After the defeat in the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to drop by as much as 700 points.
This was the biggest point loss in one day in its history.
Later, Dow gained something again.
Around 8:30 p.m., this world's most important stock market barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points at more than seven percent.
The worst performer was in Dow at the moment in American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Shares in Goldman Sachs lost nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, the company's big-time investor, was involved in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called rotten mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount is not to be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive the stock exchange rate notes of financial companies, which could be reimbursed in favorable exchange rate development, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock odds in Europe are falling so much
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US is not in doubt for investors.
The share price of the capital German bank, Hypo Real Estate, is heavily downward, and is withdrawing the Dax index.
The US Dow Jones is losing out despite the state's planned rescue of the financial market.
The Spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plucked the German stock index (Dax) deep into the redneck.
The shares of the Munich real estate financier lost up to three-quarters of their value despite the Federal Government's rescue and private banks' rescue, with Commerzbank losing more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000 mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, stock markets went to its knees.
In New York, a business day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to revive events in financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in its first trading hour, making it at 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives has a rescue plan to vote, the Senate could say a vote. October.
Other European stock markets were moving in only one direction: in London, the FTSE initially weakened by 3.2 percent, with CAC-40 losing 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAx, shares in Arcandor lost their share capital after the announcement.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourist concern announced that it would not sell the shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been unaware of a mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory might not be quite right.
For nearly 18 years, the "Ulysses" space probe flew through space.
The fuel lines, which will soon freeze, they are now at risk of dying of the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been a matter of mess among scientists - the anomaly of the gravity slingshot.
Gravitational slingshot is a aircraft maneuver of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying in this case in astonishment for years: the flying bodies are not acting 100 percent in the way that a good old-age law of gravity would expect.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are accelerating or slowing down unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomalies of the gravity slingshots.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity by Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study remains convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravity slate using the so-called dark matter, the presence of which was detected by astronomers in the universe.
"The answer for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space for space explorers for about a decade.
It is based on an obviously gravitational force, the effect of which on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means that it does not broadcast or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just or visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, this dark matter makes a good fifth of the total masses of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists are back at large, according to a note from the Italian foreign minister in Egypt.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In the shootout before release, he said, six of the hijackers were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become targets for the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists introduced to the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported consistently by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiya and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages were freed.
We are just checking their health," Frattini said.
According to a report by Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides are safe and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are already expected to be en route to Cairo.
The backdrop of the shootout before the hostage release remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese military surprisingly killed the six hijackers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the quoted worker said.
He said, "it was just a matter of taking the hostage's while suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and two of them were captured.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing one of the German intermediaries, that the release of the hostages is being dragged out because the kidnappers are worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the hijackers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Police release the name of the accident victim
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was released.
The accident at Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson of the Chelmsford Road there.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was detained on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Abuse by stepfather's "left to suicide"
The years of abuse by my stepfather led the woman to kill herself, he said in court.
After confessing to eight sexual harassment cases, Michael Trerise, 77, from Stithians of Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court at Truro heard that he had regularly tied his step-dead's stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between the age of five and seven.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treris wrote in a confession.
The court also said that Ms. Randle was killed at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her up and binded her eyes and subsequently sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was said in court that Miss Randle, who spent the bulk of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was persecuted by the spectre of abuse that had been committed against her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006 they called friends of Miss Randle, who was also very much involved in surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she "referred to her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her flat in Plymouth.
She's sued for choking on a plastic bag.
The speech faced the face-to-face of his daughter's stepfather, who had written a confession ending with the words: "I binded her and binded her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death.'
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been horrible for your sacrifice to be only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
What's even more terrible is the fact that if she hadn't done so, the matter probably wouldn't have made it to court at all."
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that Stephani's parents say your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Apparently otherwise she would probably be a promising, successful, happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the train to Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were in the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the aforementioned law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
The BBC's Defence Affairs correspondent, Frank Gardner, said such a move would be surprising to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Cabinet Office," he said.
A staff member who may not be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, a term dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police to indict the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work at the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyses of Al-Qaeda and the possibilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Cooperative with creditors face B&B debt
British credit unattrays may have to deal with more than £80 million in debt after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has provided £14 billion to deposit protection for the deposit of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest of this loan will be repaid by all firms taking client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
The CEO of the Association of Credit Banks (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "finding" that the creditors and their members must pay.
The $1400 billion debt will eventually be paid off by the rescues of Bradford & Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest rate that is accumulated in the meantime will be repaid every year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Fund The BBC's cash service compensation plan confirmed that all 59 credit unions are included in this issue.
It is humbling that these institutions that behaved judiciously... must now pay off some accounts of those institutions that were not nearly so considerate
Adrian Coles, BA
He said that each firm was to pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that the credit unions were to pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that the debt interest will grow to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the credit unions will have to find £81 million to repay the interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Co-Spanley Trade Association, told the BBC that he believed it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved judiciously during the housing market boom must now pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from judicious."
According to the BSA, no backup has fallen since they appeared in 1945.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this in the next few weeks to see what are the options to protect the credit unions and their members from an account that could be relevant," Cole added.
Interest payable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, there will be interest to be paid back for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
As credit uninvilee creditors are shareholders' equity organisations, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Turkish diplomatic horizons expand
Long before Turkey began to seek to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into the Turkish bounds.
On the east bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty paces in Asia, one of the best monuments of this unsuccessful imperial ambition stands.
Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's what the tourist guides tell you.
The building sits astride at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the front, indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
Stone's dirty.
The whole structure is slowly falling apart.
But once you get inside the vaulted cash register, one can no longer have a doubt about the size of a business the westernmost gateway of which one was the station's westernmost.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium of Anatolisko-Babydad corporation.
Germany, which joined the game of empires late, intended to implement its ambitions to take over the Middle East's control with the help of this railroad, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond, the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding territories, created by the frozen boundaries of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial troops advanced from Egypt, pushing out the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And for Hydarpasha station, too, came the bad news.
In 1917, the explosion of an ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually crumbled and history has bypassed it.
But today, this gateway to Anatolia and farther east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the widening horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen boundaries of the Cold War, is over.
A new policy is now being applied - Turkey is involved.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fasah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I mounted a night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, where I was to meet one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride on the tracks that recalled the old-world rhythms of the well-known documentary Night's Post, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman's past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in paradigms of the Turkish consensus.
It aroused suspicion in the west, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main AKP tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on the developing suburbs, surrounded by half-built store houses and power-shaped handlers, where middle managers in business suits - men and women alike - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could well be a center-right politician from almost any other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey to its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomalalie," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its zámez.
Today, they must look to the east and west at the same time.
It was no choice.
It must have done both.
"But surely the time will come," I asked, "when will Turkey have to make a decision?"
"Turkey," he said, "it was not to make such a decision-making to take place."
He then emphasized what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost from memory: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea are equally to the benefit of Europe and the United States as to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, take these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpaša Station, after another mostly sleepy night, I was thinking of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who watched this building be built a century ago.
How they would be surprised to find that European ambitions in the Middle East could now, in a substantial part, be in Turkish hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called the 'hungry man of Europe'.
So, at least then, there was little doubt about which continent would be entitled to this fascinating country.
Milk up by five pc per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy announced that it would increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-call hike in February, and it comes after research conducted by a consultancy.
Retailers are to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the hike in customer prices.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk was last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi ex-PM rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid to be released on bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the allegations that she had been extradited by extortion over $50 million taka ($799,700) when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several allegations of corruption against it.
Khalid Zija, a longtime political rival to Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), has demanded that the local army-held government first give it complete freedom.
The letterers say that while she was fired on her word of honor to have a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear, according to the terms of her release, whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the High Court's order to the Supreme Court.
"The High Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying he did not need bail when he was already undergoing examinations released abroad," her defense attorney, Rafique-ul Huq, said.
"We will appeal to the High Court order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
The High People's League official said Sheikh Hasina should return home after 17. October.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to allow for medical treatment abroad.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaila Ziyah both reject all the charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not taken part in a recent blanket armored vaccination for violence linked to the Taliban.
The UN last week conducted vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says she could not have reached children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this happened despite promises by the Taliban, that it would not attack or prevent them from working for thousands of vaccination workers.
BSkyB loses ITV litigation
BSkyB lost a lawsuit to review the Commission's decision to order the firm to reduce its stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Board of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB's stake had been thwarted by the competition and gave the companies a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in a deal that prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV from buying in 2006.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had given rise to doubt the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin consortium chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisation and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - mainly because BSkyB had previously said she was willing to relinquish her voting rights.
A new investigation into the affair of American attorneys
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special plaintiff to examine the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where the report on the affair, drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmaker and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzals.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the attorneys had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned interrogated to the investigators during the investigation to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: "The allegations, including the potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys of nine U.S. attorneys in December 2006 from their posts.
At the time, the ministry said the attorneys had been dismissed because of weak performances.
However, it was later revealed that the dismissed attorneys were no worse rated than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the layoffs were motivated politically.
Some of the attorneys were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican deputies and senators, while others refused to investigate the allegations of deception against the Democrats.
American attorneys are investigating and conducting lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the redundancies and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he bore "main responsibility" for the layoffs, that he had "abdated" from his leadership position and was "reviably not engaged" in the action.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for her epic anthem, Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will be coming to the ceremony in London for his special gold prize, said he had been "honored" with the recognition he's won.
The song, which lasts for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nominations are led by the Coldplay group, which has been shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, the chief editor of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began with an instrumental part that lasted nearly two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the highest in 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell was listed for about nine years and sold for more than forty million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and was also operated on in 2003 for irregular heart rhythm after collapsing onstage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, others only utility.
But even many taxi-veterers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This tiny alley is in the East Village district and runs north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between the Bowers and Second Avenue.
With a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic lane.
There are no signs with street names.
In a regular atlas, it's virtually invisible.
Nevertheless, the aisle has an aisle of admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of the recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to redesign Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbours who say they were enchanted down the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last vestiges from before the block was refined.
However, the city's Office for the Protection and Development of the Development, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the Municipal Community Land Committee, representatives of the Municipal Authority and the firm Avalon Bay outlined a plan to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee favours the option for the street to remain in the hands of the city and requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very few plots of land, and we'd like Extra Place to be kept in its possession," she said.
"Conspirection and administration proposals could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wanted to re-paint the little street and place seats, several of which would be used by the café, whose interest in renting the space developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to fix this desolate aisle and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale had been proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Bureau of Construction Conservation, said the city had indeed wanted to sell the street, and pointed out that his office's job was to develop or manage the property.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place, it has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think the street got its name in 1802 when Philip Minthorne's large farm was divided between several of his children and no one claimed the narrow strip of land.
The back door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to the Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the backdrop of a photograph on the cover of the band's "Rocket to Russia" album.
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was littered with garbage, torn clothing and chunks of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about refining the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, claiming that the public piece of public property, even a meager, should remain public.
Others see Extra Place as a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city, which should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog named Jeremiah's Finding New York (with the subtitle "The Book of Crows: a bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), posted part of the story of Extra Place from the Comestill in the Comestre, a section of the Talk of a City that appeared in The New Yorker in the 1952 newspaper.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark even in the day's day and enclosed by rusty iron doors of warehouses and hammered windows where a week-old newspaper runs through the gully."
With a few exceptions, the aisle had looked exactly the same one Saturday night.
The rat ran across the culp-death of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where an expensive-facing shop now stands.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of discorded newspapers lay an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said he rarely thought at Extra Place, but suggested that a boost might come in handy.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thought some people underestimate the appearance of the alley in her current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in places of dark, damp and disgusting."
Debate on bilingvalita: immersion in English
In this edition of the section Focused on Education will be Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi to discuss the candidates' attitude to bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic in California and an education director at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-authored "Greather than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools."
Effectively reaching out to Hispanic voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda only proves it.
The Obama campaign observes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students are considerably less likely to graduate than white pupils," which is true.
To combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are just learning English.
But the question for Barack Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in the county of Los Angeles East.
Pupils of this school are, in the vast majority of cases, Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom arrived only recently, are only learning English.
Even so, in the state's math tests in 2008, an astonishing 100 per cent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level.
Almost the equally astonishing ninety-thirds of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level in state tests from the English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of skills and access without excuses.
Further, and this is what Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, the school's pedagogical approach for those who are just learning English, is "full immersion."
The immersion in English emphasises the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me: "We've had tremendous success with one brand-new Mexico student - after twelve months, you'd go into class and not know which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama would take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English-learning pupils should look like?
The results the school is up to be taken for granted by the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of his own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education is unclear about the pretense of Obama's answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should be taught in English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wishes to erase the performance gap, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil plummeting due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices plummeted on Monday to fear that even a US plan to bail out financial markets might not revive the economy.
Prices for term trades in oil fell as much as 7 percent to $990.80 a barrel in early trading at the New York Commodity Exchange.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial unrest on Wall Street, as well as a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a high of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel this month earlier this month, then jumped to a wave of tremendous financial-market uncertainties.
The anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the Congress Bureau announced that it had reached an agreement over the weekend for the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report was overshadowed by the fresh fears that the financial crisis was a long way off.
In the latest episode of the advancing decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy the banking section of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgian governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to the plan to save the economy "failed to revive the mood of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"Services for global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become severely insecure," analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe the commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our greatest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread worldwide and especially to China."
Analysts from the bank have cut back expectations for next year, as oil consumption has fallen due to slower economic growth, and have downed their 2009 petrol price forecasts by about 20%.
Wild Ride in the second quarter broke the team's record
After spending more on the Jets in the last eight seasons than anyone else, defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a scoreless game into a spanking run.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals equalled their tormented play to the gloomy clouds above each other.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranues to a 12-yard drop-out sprint, heralding a perfect afternoon in which their progressive collaborations moved miles ahead.
Favre sent out the Colesse in that quarter for two more touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and the next 10 seconds before the halfway point of the game.
"It wasn't extraordinary," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a hell of a good player.
We've been very good at it, whatever people think."
While Favre and Coles were in the toss, the defense attacked the quarterback Card Kurinals Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it to a touchdown 32 yards.
Safety Eric Smith picked out another pass and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forced Warner into fumbles.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that the Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals came to the ball 10 seconds into the game, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to take a 34-0.
That's the most the Jets have ever gotten in one quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said, "I can tell you that I've enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.
It scored many points in a short period of time."
Rested Gebreselassie improved his world record
The Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, when he broke his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile-long race in under two hours and four minutes.
With a victory on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 p.m., he rolled by 27 seconds on his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran in Berlin last year.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, set the 26th world record for his career, which is truly incredibly wide - breaking the world record or at least being a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped the Olympic Marathon in Beijing because he was - perhaps too alarmed in retrospect - that the polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunshine and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a flash-dry diameter of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What the track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have focused on longer runs, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and missed a week of practice.
The break was evidently more buzzing than delaying him.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little bit in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - because he was said to be over-plan planning his races, generally avoiding the world's marathon to the top, relying on conductors as if it were a track race, and setting world records above the sense of the competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running qualities.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenya, Gebreselassie reached the half at a time of 1:02:04.
After the conductors dropped out, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Khenko runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles from the goal, Gebreselassie last took over and escaped from Kwambai, who then ran to second place at 2:05:36 to improve his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the excellent year culminated in the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19, Irina Mikititnko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a citizen of Germany.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff of the UK.
The 36-year-old Mikitěnko surprisingly won the London Marathon at 2:24:14 last spring.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something described as a back injury but recovered and won in Berlin, improving her personal best by almost five minutes in the third marathon that she had ever run.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan cross-country skis escape to a big lead, and then dragged them down after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in a time 2:25:01.
The pride and obstacles to the life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the scattered amusement parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of African-American life is alive.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as easy as she described it in 1935: "a city of five lakes, three crocet playgrounds, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, a shortage of navajávy, two schools and no prisons."
Now it's a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eyonville festival Zora! to pay tribute to the Hurston, the most famous female female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains sidelined, even though it has made it a tourist stop by including him in a Florida-based tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the Depression.
She is still as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that country blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their real feelings with a white man who "failurers of us know so little that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many of the residents here remain cautious about the views of foreigners.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city's oldest parish.
"It must be the right thing to do."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and exertion.
It is both a historical model of the black rise and the community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is double the national average.
It is a centre of literature, but also an oak-shaded example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that arose from American slavery.
It is not very surprising that the residents here are both proud and conservation.
And the fears of the idea of Eatonville really began with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She presented to the world her hometown through heartfelt books full of dialect as "Mules and Men (Mules and Men)" and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida Tourist Guide changed the city a short distance to Route No. 17, which runs through the often epandomous center of Florida, in the stage of black history and the human drama.
With the vigor of a big drum in her life and in literature, Hurston led the reader to the store of the first mayor of Elyonville, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left, next to the road," she wrote, "is a white brown-covered national school with well-maintained backyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even if he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband, Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into an hour-long hotel."
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, reinstatement and sex.
This was clearly not the typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says ninety-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the glee choirs of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortalising by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipper-based eccentric, which she often came back after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that for the most part, when she rushed to the city, she arrived unannounced in the huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing trousers in the city, which is still proud of her dignified dress.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were grinning.
"People have always been happy to see Zor," said Franklin.
But, he added, rocking to a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it, along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had lived.
There were no major mourners or major public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood its importance to the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the biography of Hurston "Wrapped in Rainbows (Accalted in the Rainbows)" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to use the city to stretch the five-way highway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, a local two-lane main road.
Orlando's sprawl has already pushed the Interstate No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to stir races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came in and threw oranges and stuff at the people who were siding with," Franklin said.
"In fact, we had a lady who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.'
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, and said his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber that she was "insulting rather than glorifying for my race."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"The Blacksmas children were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher this morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director of the nonprofit Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save the Eatonville Community).
This lasted until the teachers and pupils were from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
Nevertheless, civil rights helped create a space for many more Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose to the preconceptions with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How anyone can deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to the unmarked grave of Hurston and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a bookstore's clubhouse vaunted by a Hurston's résumé from Robert E. Hemenway, which put her back in the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter found the ramp lights again.
The Hurston's former neighbors now considered her a saviour.
To show what it can happen to destroy its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration event two years later, and many go back to the celebration in January.
The state backed away from the motorway proposal after several years.
"The five currents of the highway resurrected, you'd say it's detonated, real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
Victory over the motorway project helped change the city's image.
Extra-urban ones like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to rethink the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 at the re-painted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes act like a backwater lane in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90 percent black is.)
Strangers who come to find the story and the meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is to have in advance and certain things - such as murals in the oldest Eysonville church, painted by white people and depicted by blacks in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, the courageous, self-assured teacher who likes the deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
Even as the Hurston Festival got bigger, domestic pride has also increased.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as she saw her entire race: beautiful, with trouble and so, but not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, hard-working, foolish, foolish and varied, and varied as other American races and ethnicities.
The voice of Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, is a sincere love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in a local government or a police force she says would take some help.
And even the younger ones, such as the 11-year-old twins from the Alondro and Alexia Kenon's Winter Park, they seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others,' " Alondra Kenon said recently after the church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look at the history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak fluently in financial terms
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If the tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from newsstands and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the glass-wielding hive of the offices above their heads, the bankers and managers of the investment funds who monopolige New York have the worst "bad day of the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still rattling the metal carts down the sidewalks, carrying muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between the towers and wear, like human mules, the fifties of the ironed shirts that hang from the weights on their backs.
The office rats are still in line for their morning bagel at the street's dining stalls, and it's still impossible to get a yellow cab between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. on a weekday.
It didn't look like a crisis at all until I decided, with all the talk of pessimism, to set up a savings account on Thursday afternog.
Even though I timed this task to coincide with a late-effectay sestive at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting in the queue.
Not in front of the cash-into windows to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where older clients book checkbooks, tourists ask for a trip to the Macy's convenience store, and new customers set up bills.
Most of the people before me, I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
But compared to me, they've already collected their savings from the smaller banks in the places they've come from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They have raised money from so-called thrifts (a little similar to building societies), the monetary associations and the types of savings banks, whose branches operate in only one state, and claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly failed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion in assets, went into bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
Employees of the offices and shops who stood in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their cash to a bank that is seen as a safe haven and that does most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent in the financials over the last week.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and commented on Lehman Borthers, that bankrupt bank, and to her emaciated senior executive, Dick Fulde, with such familiarity, as if he were rugging about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed 50-year-old homeowner in my apartment building, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I now have my savings in the money market funds.
I've moved it, I won't risk."
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford musical supervisor since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (anothers, 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district music plan, the excellent young Proteus choir founded a year.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang for the last time in 1979, there were almost 30 of us - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mylogical shape-mining converter) represented the choir's willingness and ability to embark on any music presented to it - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and all because of the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained completely unchanged throughout.
How often did Tod just tell us to "let music speak for ourselves."
He said, "The Tunister knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Sing it, then! "
His baton technique was crystal clear and precise, but neither dictatorial nor florid.
Wherever the musical standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes in :
If a conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he conducted the Guildford Philharominsky from 1962 to 1982.
I've reviewed more than 100 of his concerts in the last 40 years or so, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by any of them - and I've been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had this great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "crashed or two of the world's soaked-in stones."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhDs."
This is based on the author's remark in the Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he finished his dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as a publication by the British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff has passed this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated after Austria's right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from Austria's right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of Belgium's right-wing Vlaams Belang party, is attending a rally that presented the "City against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to the "City Against Islamization" organization.
They bear signs similar to the road signs that show mosques crossed out by the red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria over the same weekend in which the extreme right-wing parties made huge gains in the general election.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun, near Linza, were heavily damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits spray-painted Jewish symbols on some of the graves, such as David's star, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists waged by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic community here said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming as the Muslim Lentil Month of Ramadan is nearing the end of the Muslim Lenting Month.
Meanwhile, Austria is entering the round of searching for its own soul after it swung to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, conducted a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the Freedom Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against headscarves and burqa in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to the foods that are perceived as a relationship to Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election, which put the extreme right on the position of the country's strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was mainly due to young voters who are worrying about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed on a trip across the border
Gary Glitter, the glamrock star who was convicted of sexually abusing children, was banned by the court from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he planned to travel via France to Spain.
Kent police were agreed to by the travel ban last Thursday after handing over to officials evidence of Glitter's past child sexual abuse convictions.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Lowest Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the judicial service said: "On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the KentJ police requested a regulation to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as required by a record in the sexual attacker's record.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They must also hand over the scheduled date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police Department has announced that it will not hear individual cases of Glitter's possible trips around the district.
A spokeswoman for the CEC Police said: "The Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to see someone who stays in Britain, because we have extensive systems that handle the potential danger more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent Police Department, and we are working carefully to monitor the behavior of the recorded sexual attackers to reduce any danger to the public to a minimum."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok to join a flight to London.
But he said he was not feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his attorney, David Corker, went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London, while at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order requiring him to register as a sexual assailant.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the UK for four months for possessing child pornography.
A homeowner from the Interior Ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and glad that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I'm taking pictures of the master off the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no ruffles or costumes.
Only the essence of the great flamenco masters, disengaged from the focus on the interpretation - I just achieve the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other - man.
The non-discomfort, aside from the privacy, in those moments away from the audience - awareness of a close gesture can be seen then, a glimpse of a glance, or a passionate hand glamour, which is carefree because they are not about to appear on the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in the "Flamenco-people" theatrical performance with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique flamenco iconography from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the programme Month of Flamenco Photograph (Mes de la Photographers Flamenco), "reflects the ever-growing international importance of flamenco," says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people like, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical pictures of artists on the scene.
These "on the street" portrait artists are able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portrait of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers for a board camera.
They are portraits that, thanks to the selection of the camera and the material, resemble a classic photo.
The application of different stylistic means is at odds with the film's classic basis and bestows on the film and lends it to it of its current spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, mirrors flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which continues to surprise and evolve."
What tear the audience downs is not the work of the dance itself, the singing or the play, but the personality and character of the artist.
Finding the moment when we encounter the most essential, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is a constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of nearly seventy photographered artists is shaped by well-known flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo, among others.
The project has become a kind of an anthology of flamenco and will soon receive a book edition that will include the exhibited portraits.
Passion for portrait brought Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating the idea of "The PortARTproject" of the Sports Veterans ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept from "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "taking pictures of people, getting to know them and have the opportunity to enter their lives for a moment, whether longer or just short - that's my passion.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in the photograph.
You meet or clash with people, personalities who sometimes don't even know, or only give them a few minutes for a photo shoot.
Despite the circumstances of similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of contemporary flamenco portraits called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery in de la Mata 20 Street, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until the 16th. October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes is "trouplerity"
It takes place in an environment he does not yet know and tells of the events of the unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel, the main character of which is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and has also traveled in the Amazon.
The Eternal Nobel Peace Champion for Literature pleaded guilty at the Hay Festival Segovia Festival yesterday that the project that currently employs him "is audacity," and that "everything suggests that I should not write" of this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will, and I believe I will finish it one day," he concluded at the festival's contribution to the festival exchanging ideas, ideas and words, which in the four days saw in the city of the aqueduct around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters in the third edition of the Word Festival and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the Most Popular Writer - the old edition of Dickens's "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a resigned audience in front of him, who had passed like water - a Peruvian with an astonishing accuracy and a good deal of humor recalled how, from the original "incredible adventure" of "the joy of a passionate reader" and from "I can live more than what I have lived" gave birth to a literary mission; as he supersedes the "non-understaff of inspiration" by writing "disciplined," carefully stackles, correcting and rewriting the lyrics, correcting and rewriting; or how they influenced his writing Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "remembrance images" were the essential basis of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that there is "no way" to find out if and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere entertainment, a fleeting experience" - pointed out by Vargas Llosa, saying that he said it "acts to people" and "make them out of lineage," and called on the writers to "nolog of frivolity" and "take responsibility" on their mission.
Due to climatology loses the festivities in Pozoblancu - a lacking of the spear
The spearhead performance, which concludes with the Inking Festival, was cancelled yesterday morning after the performers' announcement was confirmed that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That is why the company, along with Fermín Bohórquez, Pabloem Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
The unfavourable weather conditions have plagued the festivities for a long time, with two of the three celebrations that could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfighting.
During these, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to be built for the bulls in the arena at Castilblanc.
But this was only celebrated on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was brought to the shoulders by the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two shots with spears for greetings and one ear, which had been brought to him by the open-air seats in the arena than the bullfighter's art.
Worse still, it was El Juli, who had walked through the bullring's Los Llanos, unhappily of the Blast.
In the second round of toil without a breather, he drew harsh criticism from most of the audience.
They drove a check-in in a van with 2,000 kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes five.
Road control of Ertzaintza in the district of Armiñón (Ala).
Members stop two people riding in the van and they are speeding away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, they were persecuted by members of the perpetrator and detained by one of the people riding in the van, a man aged 38, who was identified as A. A. J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out a road check at the N-1 in the places where it passes through the border of the city district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop the van for the purpose of checking, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated sharply, and drove off.
The officers immediately began to chase the car until the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few miles away, at which point the two passengers jumped out and fled to the woodland.
Members of Ertzaintza eventually caught up with one of them and seized 2,177 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as revealed during a search of the Iveco Daily van.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with packets of hashish, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expert and weighing the drug.
In addition, police have discovered that the license plate is "squirting" and disagreeing with the data provided in the delivery documents, the detainee was therefore also charged with falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the confiscated drug.
Detained A. A. J., 28, was taken to the police department to handle the appropriate formalities before a further investigation is made later.
Actress Heather Locklear detained for driving under the influence of medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of Melrose Place, was detained in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend for driving under the influence of medication.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers while trying to leave the Montecito parking lot, a spokesman for the California Road Patrol told People.
The witness clarified that at about 4:30 p.m. Locklear "went stepping on the gas, moving forward and backward at the loud roar, trying to get out of the parking space - she ran off her sunglasses several times as she backed up."
The witness, who did not seem to recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear a moment later, stopping on a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because "she had a fear for Locklear's life."
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the roadway.
"She looked disoriented," so the officers took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to submit to the test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were immediately out of the question, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was evident to the officers at first glance."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic to recover from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The U IUU and MEP, the U.S. left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that a final decision in the case of the former councillor of the Youth and Sports City Hall of the Seville, Manucola Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of dealing on behalf of his family, would be dependent on the party's regional association.
"I am too federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares suggested of the negotiations the party will have to proceed with a former member of the Sevilla City Council.
However, the IU chief insisted that in the case of the investigation into the illegal conduct committed by Silva, "transparency" was absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions."
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), an epic gamble by Garcia
In the film "The May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), which was inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's epithets from the national past, revives the Spanish's glorious uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around €15 million.
In this way, the film-maker wanted to "draw the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of the company" he had always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during a presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of performers.
May's blood with a metre of over two and a half hours will be released in theaters this Friday, with a more than four-hour series for Telemadrid television in the future.
As a great admirer of Galdós' literary work, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled a "child dream" by making this film, which is due to Esperanto Aguirre, who tasked him with making a film for the bicle-left anniversary of Madrid on May 2 with the offer to make the April 2nd, with the plot accepting the plot to be based on the Epizod National Past.
The 15 million budget, to which the Madrid province contributed completely, means for Garcia's "unique opportunity" to create an environment with backdrops and costumes matching a picture of "the creeping Spain, which was mistaken in the leader for whom he could go to fight - the struggle for independence led under the reign of Ferdinand VII to the country's decline and backwardness," he said.
But the director regrets not being able to count on the financial support given to the films The Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goya's Ghosts - almost twice the Flower Blood - so he could not make some scenes from a script signed at the same time by Horace Valcárcel, with whom he works for almost the entire film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver a empezar) works as he is commonly used to - to the scene, along with the actors with whom he usually rehearsals before filming and who he does not choose by casting, because he finds it "sophagusating" and also believes that "part of the director's profession is to go to theatres and cinemas, among other things, and thus learn what is happening in the craft he engages in"."
Many of the actors he selected for May's Blood have appeared in front of his camera for the umpteenth time, such as Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, with four Oscar nominations, one of whom won, is of the opinion that none of the three female candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Bilire and the last selected Blind Sunflowers, does not represent the younger generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "it is yet to be discovered."
For this film, Garci does not expect any awards.
"At first you think you work for what happens after that, but then you realize that you only work for profit, so you submit to make one more film," explains Garcia, with a career from over 30 years of directing.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Sevilla dancer Tórtola Valencia
The Seville flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Sevilla dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from her father of Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and moved to London with her family when she was three years old.
She danced modern dance and focused on Oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, a pioneer of female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought to abolish the corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was enchanted by Isabel Bayón.
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible.'
According to the dancer, "I'm not about telling her life, it's about grasping the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "twent's butterfly" evoked me to the guajir or "snake's danced" some tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also fits this aesthetic," he claims.
The show envisions the involvement of two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing to Isabel in one performance as well as in the "Open Door" (La puerta abiert), and with the dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the older Tōrtol, a mature figure.
I'm happy she's accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums El Pajara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfry Juárez, "who plays the role of an eternal guide to this kind of female artists who are prima donnaami with everything, and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place for his time in such far-off places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as across Europe, as she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who have a huge influence at some time, but today no one knows her and appreciates her even less then," says Bayón.
The show starts at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vegy.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina's "Flamenco a Life" because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
They attracted me to me with the simplicity and powerful charge with which the audience affects them, and the consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
The Resino can capture magical moments."
The book "The Daily Married" concludes the trienade
The launch of the first illustrated edition of the "Freshly Married Daily" at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate the "Trienále Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), held to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the Anniversary of their Death.
"Trienal Zenobie and Juano Ramón" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The Sunbeit Shine," which opened in May this year, and, after it has toughen up various Andalusian provinces, is scheduled to move to New York at the time of the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Andalusian Government also commissioned eight hundred copies of the "Freshly Married Daily" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis, to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the most sane Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like it so much
"Sometimes God makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Wicked Evil" and, under the weight of the knowledge that Newman had left, reveals his plight of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how it took them before he got Oskar.
And that he had been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be gravely ill.
Even so, he was a man for everyone.
"Sometimes you can't express what you feel in any way, and now I've lost a great friend," Robert Redford said tearfully, "my life and my lands were better because of it."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of the film and the country died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-esteem is at the bottom, when there is desperate for reasons to be held to be held.
When the times are rough and the people without virtue, and only a handful of those who are worth admiring - there's no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from the Foundation Against Drug Addiction, based on the honor of the firstborn son, who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home food and organic food.
A total treasure for a country that has been given much effort to get away from the suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that it was not one man who died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, Oskar's director-winner Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the highlight of his career without exaggeration.
The evil boy of Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who nowadays has the courage to try to live like a life of Paul Newman - prides himself on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luckily, there are people like that, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal, though he certainly had more than enough opportunities to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be accompanied by pride in heaven that there is a communion between his daughters and admirers on the ground - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "from all the great roles he embodied, he was the proudest of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a dedicated philanthropist."
The perfect Madrid race
Yes, many of us are eager for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failed year of 2012, it will be possible 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we're going to run last night's race, I'm saying: no!
He was referred to as a perfect race, and in my judgment he was the worst I'd ever been to.
Such a load of nonsense that right away, if it came to the evaluation and I was the examiner, it would be clearly inadequate.
But let's look at it from the start, one at a time.
Nonsense begins with the pick-up of the racing number, for which you have to go out early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but if you go there, let them give you everything (including a chip to prevent overcrowding of the track).
Oh, no.
Here you had to first pick up the number (first nonsense, go there only for that) and (after the proper queue standout) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need the size of the XL).
Where do we live?
Did they decide to buy only small T-shirts because of the crisis, because it's less of a substance and they're cheaper?
Okay, of course, those are the little things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to go for the chip very early and the queue lasted for over 15 minutes, he had to hand in his backpack there.
Over 35 minutes took to wait a while, which is something incomprehensible at the race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put down our backpacks yet, and when we did, it was much worse with the pick-up.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes by the rain, leading to a general rebellion and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some like me will not see the right time in the evaluation of the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I assume, did not get me the start time correctly.
Of course, if someone had asked me about a perfect race, this one would not have attacked me.
And so I think we will only have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT New Technology Conference, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like summoning a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the company's premises) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
With the camera and the system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "reconceptive" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen to and understand the keywords of their conversations.
He can also sort out those present by conversational groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that she does not belong to the group that speaks to her, and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's going to see someone, and tells her he'll be attending to it in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Fascuous.
But, of course, that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk this week about a change in Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer had discovered that if computers had only the barest, no credit for commercial uselessness, they'd be five times more efficient - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as thunder when you consider that Microsoft's version is adding new features to Windows and other "extra" features.
Changing the course would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so on is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned toward the theory that it was Google's first move to a competitive competition with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be required as it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
She has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It never goes away, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system, not as an absolute truth, but of the relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, conversely, to a more internet browser.
The computer is turned on to launch Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and spend more time on the Internet every day than around the windows.
What is it for half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now keen to offer its online services and finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here I have a small example.
I took this photo in a break room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine that pleases them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's rather count as much as 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computers.
With Android and iPhone already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it to the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shining in one in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" in Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino in the "Godfather" of Francis Ford Coppola, and is also part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to embark on the list of his life's roles, we can dive into the image of a typical, pointed-shaped moustache muscle raising weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's no more than a typical cotton men's undercover, fitting and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank' but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels above all the others.
First, for his breakneck name - although he is popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to the sport, because, as the legend tells, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' excels above the other quality cotton, unisex by the cut, the distinguishing label and the (almost insignificant) Belgian flag, which the models of the most hudmamatical tins have as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian firm is not only specialising on the tank tops.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton trousers, navy T-shirts, outfits for children, mini shorts...
Thoughtful stunts for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to be just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
Honda attacks with its bestseller for the second time
In the month of November, Honda will launch a second-generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-seat vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is compiled by improved engines that increase the comfort of the ride and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
Such is the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes to this single-seat car.
It is worth mentioning, for example, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes to market six years after the launch of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will note is that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case for Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year's 2008.
It has been in Japan that nearly a million units have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market was the old continent, with around half a million units sold in six years.
However, the Honda aims to boost the new Jazz's sales in its category.
Thus, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz units, in 2009 estimates are expected to be 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will make it possible for Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The automaker's management thus de facto expects the year to close with a total of 22,000 units sold, which means 4,000 less than in 2007 and a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is a Honda Insight, a five-door compact-size hybrid with a length of 4.37 metres, from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 a year worldwide.
As far as markets are concerned, according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight will be sold in the United States, while the old continent and Japan split the remaining percentages.
The launch of the Honda Insight is expected to start in the first months of next year as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions have been increased for the new Jazz.
Its length increased to 3.9 metres (by five centimetres more), the width to 1.69 metres (two centimetres more) and the wheelbase to 2.5 metres, which means an extension of five centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 metres.
The larger size was also increased by the interior space.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which had already been used for the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the luggage capacity - which has a double bottom system - increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the first-generation luggage compartment.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur with the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement in addition to external features - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment with a glass panoramic roof - is easier to access the back seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows an angle of opening of 80 degrees compared to the first Jazz.
For the second-generation Honda Jazz, the engines are new.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and deliver an excellent improvement in the propulsion system at the same time as high torque in full engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine has a power output of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had a previous generation of the Jazz 78 horsepower - has a consumption of 5.3 litres and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower for the previous generation, the current one will be 100.
The 100-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mother. Who will be the father is not my concern."
A tremendous resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though of small builds, is a life-filled woman.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new tenure in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means a lot more than just lending some pretty, famous girls their name.
In Paris, she attended a graduation event held by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most insignificant fashion awards that the Spanish company sponsors.
She is both cordial and shy and will win you up close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this fall-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and the Opera Festival and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
So it was a challenging but also exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you are working for the fourth season, based on?
I and my sister love films from the '50s and '60s, and we drew on many of them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk dressed, how they combine and layer their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I'd liked my clothes when I was a little girl, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's house, go through my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the fair.
Then when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of the way I wore to dress.
You know, we dancers pride ourselves on how we are groomed to feel comfortable in our hours and rehearsals looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you actually break into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for the designer and the professionalism.
You were 30 recently, did you have a crisis?
Nope.
I feel better than I've ever felt before, I enjoy 30s.
I find that the woman is already done, has experience and relives life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done what I want to do, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But I know one thing for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and raise him with great affection.
As far as the film is concerned, you're now in for a few premieres of the films you made last year.
It is, and I'm looking forward to coming to the cinema.
I come from the theater world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and of course I can't do that.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you're going to like...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the catwalk alongside Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to step on the pier as a model.
I was merely called by Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend a benefit parade for her organization "Women for a Better Life," and the clothes we were showing - I also selected two models from our collection for Mango - was auctioned off and the proceeds were handed over to this Naomina NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are said to be about it, and I, knowing it, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's involved in.
She asked me to do the show for charity, but when she asks me to do a handstand, I'll do it, too.
I will do what I need in the benefit of third world women.
"Auto bee" prevents collisions
To progress in the development of anti-accident technologies, Nissan was this time inspired in nature, specifically with bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes bee flying as a model, thus preventing collisions.
Such is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in the precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Center for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. developed the robot in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in the scientific and technology research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology, R&D of the Brand, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Nissan Security Shire of the Four Zones.
The robot is designed to strengthen the ability to prevent precipitation in the brand's cars.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan's safety shield.
The most important, however, are the compound bee's eyes, which are able to be seen in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, which the bee allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, the engineers designed what they called the laser Range Finder.
It records obstacles that are located up to a distance of two metres within a 180-degree radius of the BR23C, calculate the distance of the object and sends out the signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately converts it to a collision warning.
"The moment the obstacle is recorded, the robot emits the bee movements and immediately changes the direction by turning the wheels into the right or even larger angle to prevent the collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are perfectly instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer at this project.
The robot, unlike the bees, cannot move upwards or downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and the direction that is made possible by rotating its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and capabilities as for bees.
Nissan therefore, in addition to acceleration and slowing down, used the rotation function to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The facility only needs to process the information every few seconds and act according to these data.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuitions from previous manoeuvres, which allows it to function without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
It may come as a surprise to you, but we don't talk about the gig or the mega in memory."
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate precipitation prevention, a technology for which Nissan predicts to be used in serial cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to embed a unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to their destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior is demanding that the driver, with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol, must have to install a system in his car to prevent him from starting a drunk car or if he is not breathing.
The proposal became known in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will take one year.
Its aim is to return the driver behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a course for the transport re-education.
In addition to the National Transportation Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for the Car Safety for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between the 30 and 75% of the car drivers charged more than once for drunk driving in this state, they get behind the wheel again.
Alcolock should prevent this as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the exhaled air and prevents the car from being started if the driver is not breathing before or if it is recorded above the permitted alcohol concentration.
Its price exceeds €1,000 and the culprit himself would have to pay for it.
A study conducted to this effect in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with this equipment reduced offences by 65 % during the first year of introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 people could save the lives of the lives each year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: for this behaviour to be dealt with before it results in a criminal offence.
And to help its implementation, as the legislation can be implemented in the usual way, but the necessary regulation of the criminal provisions requires an amendment to the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) proposal, recommending that it be installed on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as it said in the program, it landed in the presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in México D. F. a Spanish air force plane in which the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was now setting, but its rays were still forcing their eyes to be blocked with their hands to see the successor pair climbing out of the plane.
Beneath the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours earlier, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Prince of Spain was coming with the princess for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, you're not going to be able to get people to the airport at that time... She's from here or what...
-No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
Yeah, well, all right...
But the Mexican press knows well who the prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport close to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honorary volley.
The prince appears with a smile on her lips in a dark blue suit, and the princess, very sparingly dressed and with her hair flowing, does not have her usual "peeptoes" apparently reported to her that in D. F. threatens storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and forbid in their way.
The hotel doorway, where they will be staying, one of the city's four largest, is a chatty Mexican TV reporter.
Enjoy your fear before you take out your mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having enough capital to distribute the injections, is not lacking in inventiveness.
In the face of a crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages from banks with dubious solvency, it has created a popular-educational "Bad Credit Hotel" game online.
Or "Hotel of bad loans"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel, and its receptionists in particular, look grim to think once, twice, or three times about whether the time is right to apply for credit.
Above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, albeit not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, a dream room appears.
At least something, because you'd better not talk about buying a house...
Best Subsidized Fashion Award
There is probably no more suitable place in the world to announce the fashion award than Paris, and it is perhaps not a more exquisite designer and a bonafide than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable the international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is subsidised by the sum of EUR 300 000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of her first year, yesterday looked at her designs in the Manga window on Paris's Haussmann 54 ams and was almost weeping with emotion.
To be sure, it is the second largest deal of this company in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square metres.
The largest is in London.
Many of the events, along with the desire to thank the designer, Valentin, for taking the presidency of the competition jury, have caused us to finally have a sumptuous dinner at the Paris Opera House of Garnier.
The Mango firm's so-to-air preschickboard table looked a little more amazing in addition to Chagall's most honoured works.
Nati, who had shown no sign of heart-broken grief because of her brother's recent death, wore the gown of the brand and the ELAH jewels over which he held his breath, and hung up on his son Luis - a six-foot-tall dandy - accompanied Valentin at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the chief executive and owner of Mango, took the reception and, as a true gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild were left without a jacket, both of whom were offered to the two ladies.
Mónic Cruz, who arrived at the store in the - hand-designed - trousers and shirt and changed into a long black sexy dress for dinner, was touched by a night walk in the Opera Encame accompanied by Goy Toledo, showed us the Ballet Exerriefs' Oral, and, remembering other times, she grabbed one of the poles and hinted at "grand a plié."
Inés Sastre did not linger for a tour of the palace's adorescence, but showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before she left.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had come to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and asked in advance that no scents be used in his rooms.
Stars under the star Parisian sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not the 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
To make matters worse, they are all summarised in one book that will bring to the bookstore relaxation on 30 September.
The alarm rings at 7 o'clock every morning as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that brings contemporary life.
The office is called voltage and the computer is back pain.
Stress is a 21st century sickness.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of breaking away from the world of work.
No, the number is no bigger than 1001.
Outside of yoga positions, classical massages and "spa" therapies on her book's website, Susannah Marriott collected the entire "menu" of possibilities, adapted to the tastes and time possibilities of each individual.
The counter-study book is called "1001 How to Relax" and, thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK, it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "leg" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have the adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in the body, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off and concentrate on reading.
Talking from sleeping
Some of the kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us briskly about something that happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens the first time, it may be startled, but it's actually insignificant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokievica.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of you told you that he was talking in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime in high fevers), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is not just one reason to explain her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night-time fog, enuresis nocturna (night wetting) or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or heated situations.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The intensity with which it emerges is also different.
A child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (calling, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where they manifest with great force, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes him great anxiety and manifests himself in this way.
We said it was a harmless disorder, so it is not treated for leave only if it is associated with the next sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
What we can do to make sure of a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the child too much before going to bed.
So to find calm games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can be relieved, it is possible to use relaxing techniques to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somnilokievies appear, try to keep the composure.
Remind yourself that she is harmless to the child and that she will remember nothing of what happened the next day.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It's pointless because he's not conscious and you'll stop his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and thus rests.
Remember that if it seems to you several times in a row that he is in a hurry, it would be advisable to turn to the advice or find out what causes such an anxiety in the child.
If he understands what he's saying (which is not usually the case), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and pull information from it.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, she's not conscious to organize her thoughts.
Plus, you'll hear what he's saying, but you don't know what he's dreaming about, and therefore why he's saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're coming to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him at night about his secret.
Not even for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Don't worry about it, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Finally, after a long, lean period, Illhaeusern found his way back to victory.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-blacks created more chances and were able to convert one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this encounter in which the attackers found it difficult to assert themselves.
After the captain's first attempt, the hosts Kauffmann, who narrowly missed the link with a long shot, Illhaeern began to have a slight upper hand and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long leg or Diebold, and Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemarie's defenses.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the pitch, leaving only the agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first by Dannemarie's two chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the scoring for the Illhaeern, which was taken care of by the Marais, well-placed to handle the ball repelled after the previous Diebold's attempt (53').
Illhaeusernu, however, did not enjoy the joy for a long time, for a long time, he was forced to return to the locker room and thus leave his teammates in a weakened position.
Dannemarie, however, was unable to profit from it, and the eleven from Illhaeern, who withdrew just a little to "warm up" the defence, no longer caused any major trouble, with the exception of the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the crossbar after much confusion.
Sarkozy goes to angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy takes a detour through Brittany.
To counter a demonstration of the strength of fishermen who on Monday severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports, the French president decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped to "come up with concrete proposals."
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against a sharp rise in diesel prices that peaked at an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president will "interpretate with them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better safeguard the conditions of employment and disburse the sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fishermen with firmness.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation to "dairy" (operation of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10km constipation.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but services in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
The Quiberon Peninsula has been put into operation by a filtration dam.
The sailors proved their determination as early as Monday, when they were burning tires and pallets at dawn just outside the hey stores of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the l Manche Canal, as to the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in the harbor, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they would decide to act themselves until Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is to decide on Tuesday how to continue on the set trip and to attend the forthcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the state fisheries department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" as "the fishermen will not drop from nothing" and "would not appear in Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairwoman of the fishing department at Lorient.
Occupational fishermen who do not pay diesel tax currently pay around 50 cents a litre, but they reckow at the ship's return threshold is only reached when diesel is under €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman spectacular
The unforgettable "Butche Cassidy and the Kid" has died in the aftermath of cancer at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes paid their respects to the film's legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery requirements for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is relying on the delivery of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession hovering over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains its delivery prepositions for 2008 with 215 delivered devices, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer expects a lot from the Chinese market, particularly with the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has supplied Chinese clients with 41 devices in the space of eight years.
AIG is said to be considering stepping up 15% of its assets
The American International Group, insurer who was leaked to the water by the US Cash Offices, is considering ceding more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion given as a down payment, reports Sunday's edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its activities outside of international life insurance and pension activities in the United States, the daily, which cites sources close to the ongoing negotiations, specifies.
The AIG board of directors met during the evening on Sunday, according to the FT, to investigate the eventual ceding.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from the AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to divest itself of include its aviation leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance policy maker Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, adds to FT.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must swiftly raise cash to repay the $85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk of US authorities seizing 80% of its capital, thereby also diluting to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of an approaching 800 points, and a Nachq of 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10,365.45.
The biggest ever-hit drop in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, the resumption day of trade following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the predominant technology component lost, according to definitive data after the closing of trading, 199.61 points, and stabilised at 1 983.73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points.
Harvested since the start of the session, Wall Street literally collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan by the House of Representatives, a plan to enable the markets to find a little stability again.
With 228 votes against and 205 for the representatives, they refused to provide the Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, with the means he had asked for.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"This is the wrong signal sent to the market that sees that Congress is incapable of adopting a plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not be "too late."
"If this project is actually doomed (...), the relay will be handed over to the Fed (American Central Bank, ed.) and other central banks to avert the crisis, which would further strengthen credit terms," pointed out Brian Bethune, the head economist at Global Insight.
And, with an emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza pointed out that "every new day brings about the downfall of a financial institution."
After Friday's collapse of Washington Mutual, authorities orchestrated the purchase of the bank's Wachovia bank activities by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turnaround and has required urgent intervention for banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not "just the US crisis, but with the world crisis," added FTN Financial, an analyst at FTN.
The bond market has risen strongly.
Yolt from the cash voucher fell to 3.632% for 10 years, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, yield to 30 years to 4.161%, up from 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Banking house Morgan Stanley reported that it enters the center of the Mitsubishi Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, which will spend $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after they revealed their pre-empty agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intended to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular equities at a single price of $25.25, representing a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion to raise convertible securities that will give it a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley clarified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average single price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock was still down 6.79% and reached $23.07 at around 5 p.m. Greenwich time.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to a banking holding status," explained John Mack, the CEO of the US Group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, which is supposed to enable him to degrade his activities, but it also places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest aces from Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The conditions presented on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been amended over the last few days: last Monday, Morgan merely announced that he would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago," Toshide Mizuno, MUFG's CEO, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation will consist exclusively of regular shares.
However, in view of the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to keep the risks to a minimum and also cover ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% less than their book value for the Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the profit from the share of about 20%.
The agreement envisages that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities to regular shares in a year if the latter are exchanged for a certain period of time at a price of 50% above the exchange price, i.e. at around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought in by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, a spokeswoman for the group declined to provide additional information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of the MUFG, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15% of the Tier One's pay-as-you-go, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan clarified that he had "wrongly" downgraded his record since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its stock exchange rate has plummeted by half, while insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have risen sharply.
These costs took the opposite turn on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivors" of Wall Street's major investment bank after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch's buyout, announced that it had raised $15 billion in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Refour the republic around the socialism of the XXI century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third seed put forward a proposal for a new constitution, following the example of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is accomplished, as 64% of the electorate, according to the official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, "No" received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
To be adopted, the draft of the Constitution had to receive half of the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted at the exit of the polling station and the non-governmental organisation's counted predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, setting them in the range of 63% to 70%.
Indeed, Rafa Correa demanded to win his draft Constitution during the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution won on the whole end," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil Governor's headquarters, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received a congratulatory card from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the Organization of the States of America (OEA), took place peacefully, concerned a text on 444 points building a "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution will sanction the state's power over economics by reserving to it the "planning of the development" of a country living mainly from diesel mining by foreign companies and from foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal sponsored by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the Head of State, which will be able to perform two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this authority to run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution consolidates the principle of free health and education, which the president began to implement in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit to use the Ecuadorian base as the starting point of US drug operations.
Obama wins points in first televised duel
The first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House was followed by a second debate to find out which of the pair's John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The command tents of the Republican and Democrats' campaign were not surprised when both announced their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, decent as he was, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a drop in the polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), reckons that the Democrat is the one who won the duo.
Among undecided voters who just matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of respondents, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the supposed good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and the only public debate with his opponent, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," Bill Clinton said at the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while also emphasizing the "nail" of his opponent's "nausea" on the issues that formed the heart of the first encounter.
"It seems that Senator Obama did not understand that..." was the repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge enough to become president," he also assured.
In such an offensive spirit, the Republican TV spots have been in the lead since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represented the future.
He did not lose his head and proved brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to take the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still misunderstood, while Obama did," the Democratic spot replied over the weekend, accusing the Republican of not taking sufficient account of the impact of the crisis on the "regular American."
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at the North Carolina Preciling Meeting in Heavy Blow.
He did not even utter words like "the middle class" or "working." The financial disincentive unequivocally favours Obama, whom Americans see as more capable of saving an economy on the brink.
"There could be a decisive reversal next week," influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic nominee, the current scourge is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as run by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected jumps of Wall Street, he should be able to cut taxes on 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that the implementation of the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is its number one priority, along with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, plans to build a fleet with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial aid plan adopted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the polls closed on the main square in Minsk Square to protest the irregularity of the elections to parliament.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation."
Some admit that they didn't even vote: "What would it do if they do what they want with my vote anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been warmer to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to take a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, which include the visa ban on 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the election is considered to be clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, of a diverse grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," stresses Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "as it is essential who adds up the votes, and with us it is executive power.
If any opposition MPs make it to parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning because "a dialogue with the European Union is needed.
For if our economy, deeply in debt in Russia, is affected by the crisis and we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has watched the election, not to declare the elections valid.
It stresses that turnout appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all sorts of manipulations.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"There wasn't a foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who are most comfortable with the regime."
The night's silence was again hosted by the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
In Chad, 19 hostages were freed
The Egyptian squad stormed the kidnapper of eleven tourists and their eight-man escort who were captured ten days earlier.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were fed alive and well on Monday to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, they were freed in Chad by an Egyptian commando squad.
The hostages arrived at about 15.30, apparently in good form, aboard a special aircraft to the al-Maza military base, closely adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken without having a chance to comment on the press, on board the helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, the outskirts of the residential district of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations.
"They are quite healthy" and "the country did not pay any ransom," said the Egyptian minister of the turizom, Zohejr Garrana, on the airport's taxiway.
Since his capture on September 19, during a safari in a four-wheel-drive vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hiding place to the other by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard at the Aegyptous Agency's director, a safari organizer.
A senior official in Egypt's security services suggested that 30 members of the special forces who approached the site on board two helicopters had rushed to the mine during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the hijackers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 Egyptian special forces members from the "lighth" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, mentioned from Belgrade, where he is currently located, a role played by the secret agents and the components of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people of our secret services, the special forces," he said without further elaboration.
He also denied that the ransom was paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army said it had detained a four-wheel-drive vehicle on the patrol, carrying the kidnappers, killing six of them, including the Chad commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The quiet majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate about the financing of culture fills up the pages of the newspaper with headlines and is the subject of the ongoing election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to denigor the pitiful sums provided by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, and national memory sites that are starving?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that they are negusing their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government will donate three and a half million euros to the restoration of the mere Chamina Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Society for the History of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, joined in 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy, to unravel history, preserving a pile of private archives and protecting the archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often, it is these companies that are the watchdogs of our sights, which are driven by hopeless protest when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers onto old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see a grandstand for history and monuments?
Interview - Blood, which is again certain
Héma-Québec was celebrating the tenth anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly rejoicing, for Héma-Québec had become one of the world's most reliable and efficient blood suppliers.
Above all, he has regained the public's trust, which was seriously shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the national reserve of blood administered by the Department of Transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and a wave of public reign, the Canadian government launched a public investigation in February 1994, presided over by Judge Horace Krever, which was aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate a recommendation that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Krever delayed handing over the report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee stood up for this role.
After the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to farm Quebec, and the Canadian bloodstream to supply all the provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec launched his activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was dismal.
By systematically trying to increase the safety of blood products and constant work in this area over the coming years, we have regained public confidence," he says, adding, proudly that in early 2008 Héma-Québek was already trusted by nearly 94% of the québean population.
Dr. Décaryová, however, does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile."
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"At that time, we have seen many cases of human form of mad cow disease occurring in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says the woman, who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea whether this disease could spread through the blood.
We were therefore based on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which, when we do not know and when the spread of a serious illness is at stake, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterised by the degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, should be taken to preclude measures.
In April 1999, we therefore rejected blood from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that the disease was transmitted through the blood.
This episode has shown us that it made sense to follow the principle of prudence."
In 1999, a much more accurate HIV detection technique appeared on the market: tests with the use of nucleic acid (NAT) that allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected in the donor blood, rather than the presence of the antibodies on which the tests were based were used before.
The NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the patient's infection and the moment when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without even knowing it and without us being able to figure out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of obtaining AIDS through a blood transfusion.
The risk of getting blood from contaminated with HIV is now exposed to one person in 12 million.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before HIV anyone gets infected.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs via a blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe a blood transfusion necessary to heal in complete peace," says the head of Hem-Québek's management.
"The challenge for the next decades is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what a disease-causing element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by the sting of insects.
You need to be cautious at all times," Dr. Décaryová stresses that in addition to the secure supply, Héma-Québec must also take sufficient stocking.
"Recipes are growing because the population is aging.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelet.
The ageing of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of the Québean eligible for donation."
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the admissibility criteria, but can only donate blood once every 56 days, that is to say, six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not accepted on average because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have visited the country where the swamp fever is rampant, are excluded for one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortcomings are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be added in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, convincing people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored at Héma-Québek, which also manages the only public bank of blood from the umbilical cord in Québek.
The umbilical cord, previously considered to be biomedical waste, abounds in blood-rich stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th sample of blood from the umbilical cord to the bank, and we expect to be taking over a thousand a year.
Early next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décary, who describes the blood draw program from the umbilical cord as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Québek.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montréal qualified for the first-sighth U.S. of the first- division of the USL's first-sighting knockout series at Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive match of the quarter-final on the all-time leading scorer, the USL's first-sighting elimination series, with a 3-1 victory over the Seatattle Sounders.
The midfielder, Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a win-win first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino netted the remaining two goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during the first of two matches of the quarter-final, the Impact of the quarter-finals at the Starfire Complex in Tukwile, in the outskirts of Seattle, suffered a 2-1 defeat.
The Impact will measure his strength against Whitecaps of Vancouver in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, the Thunder equalized the home deficit in a 3-1 home match and eventually won 4-3, but Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinal round with a total of 5-4 goals.
The Impact should face Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will not be confirmed until today.
Briefly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attacking trio of Canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrey Kosticin cheered the attack to win Canadia 3-2 on separate raids at the Centre Bell last night.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev scored one pass in this fourth consecutive victory for the three-color of the six preliminary matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during the stand-alone raids.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian pointed out.
"I need one more fight to feel good."
'He tried to do too much in the first period,' Guy Carbonneau observed.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bets north
PM does not rule out calling for early elections before the end of the year
Right after the end of the Liberal Party Congress (Parti the Suite), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc, is running in today's by-elections.
"Distract the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition presented by Jean Charest yesterday in a visually engaging manner at the end of the Liberal Party of Quebecum Congress in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were shown behind him in a kind of picture grinder.
On the three giant canvases, a loop ran with remarkable scans of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, like in the pre-election period.
Indeed, at a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling for an early election in the fall, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The "Plan North" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the prime minister intends for Quebec, a vision of a "new economic space" that includes a labor agreement with France, a convention between Canada and Europe, and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the prime minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
Nevertheless, the prime minister confined himself to explaining why the North represented "a genre with enormous potential," but he did not give a deadline, investment levels, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: hydroelectric power stations in particular, the forest, but above all, the mining sector, buoyed by the growth of emerging countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The North, according to Charest's list, contains "nikl, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This "territory twice the size of France is with us," "is in Queek.
And he's not just with us, he's in us," he pointed out, as if to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the Prime Minister highlighted: the pursuit of gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James's bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he paused theatrically to view the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Queek, includes the part of Labrador that Québec has always demanded, the prime minister clarified during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position repeated by all the previous governments.
There is one border line that has not long existed in a convention, and if the opportunity arises, in the name of the government, I will recreat this position," he suggested.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change," he said, speaking of the north-west crossing, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that taking the territory is becoming a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially to the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pequista MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with about 30 communities.
The work was launched by the Interministerial Committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, and in which Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources) is in an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a major meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a moment when a common vision is set out.
The development of the North should, moreover, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan North will be "to be co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visa" as a fluent follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Just like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
Such was, after all, one of the still-roasted topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a large cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's ascension to the head of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rechristen the Beauharnois headquarters of the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Peaceful Revolution and Nationalisation of Water Electricity, to Bourassu, who created James Bay, our party was able to shape the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time conservative, on John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it was the turn of the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric plant, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying this between you and me, but I plan to be there," he confided to his membership base, prompting a round of applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and doubtless in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election in the autumn of this year, as the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his program was packed, especially with the federal council missions in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress gave the Liberal leader a platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially certain "agency to amend the Constitution" that went very smoothly: the PLQ (Fébeck's Liberal Party) particularly demands recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wishes to appoint Québec to appoint a portion of the members of the Canadian Council on Radio and Television Broadcasting who would have a veto on a veto in the event of a decision taken in Québek.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was adopted sceptically in its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Quebecois) Pauline Marois has once again hauled the North Development Policy of Quebec, which was launched by Landry's government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced the fulfilment of this policy.
If she were to hold on to her, "we would be further along today," Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said he would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"However, we wish it was not just a spectacle," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Mario Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - A disrespected land
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" (ho irony) in the Harper's cabinet, who in the summer of last year took the liberty of telling herself about Louise Arbour that he represented "hanba" for Canada.
To humiliate a woman who has led a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all of our admiration, says a lot about the Prime Minister's surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of the Western countries involved, did not take back to the homeland of its national, locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes into account that, at the time of the acts he is accused of having taken place, Omar Khadr was a teenage adolescent.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, is denying its word and leaving it to rot in the inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty international, and especially the Canadian Attorneys Association, advocate the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can see a fair trial in Canada.
The same government turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little about the fact that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torment.
We don't realize it, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," the words Harper is flagging so much, and which sounds so hollowy from his mouth.
The time has come for no longer to be a morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him to the mistress, to imprison him at the discretion of the head of the hitherto minority government (as will be the case after the 14th time. October...).
Many voters believe they will find rescue in the party that proclaims the Vacy, the Law, and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made up the reputation and esteem of our country.
Shame is, Mr. Toews, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Orwellian discourse by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter to Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With the logic of Orwellian, it confirms that the world's largest gold producer has begun the prosecution of three authors and a poor libeled small publishing house in order to trigger a "transparent public debate" and is demanding six million of them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truthfulness, especially in the case of prosecution for libel, but by law.
Not surprisingly, Garver is completely ignored by this crucial distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate to break anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the process, the author and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be ready to defend themselves and fight in a highly unbalanced fight with an army of attorneys supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, the tactics in these unbalanced struggles often consist in the degrading of the defendants in order to enforce conciliation proceedings that will be floundered by the opposing party and, moreover, by the subject of anyone who dares to pursue the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view to the matter to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate normally consists in an exchange of ideas, rather than in baton blows.
The mining company was therefore not enough to do so but to open its books, its documentation, and to establish a real debate through a newspaper, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the matter.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have any confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand a "public debate" while despising the views of the same public?
This word in the vice-president's world seems to refer to only bold-paying attorneys, and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrowed concept of the term.
In a democracy, even libelusers have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and consider the matter, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant's mouth is to be clogged (in the prosecution of the "public debate," Barrick, incidentally, has just given an official notice to the authors of Noir Canada to officially inform them that they should stop using this term...).
Aside from the surreal speech of Garver, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom of research and the search for truth, which are essential for any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote credible sources and to a debate about the facts and interpretations that itself form the basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that the rich firms of this world do not like without being prosecuted repeatedly prosecuted, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have been created if it had followed the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's overreacting clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it has no appetite for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures to limit such a type of unjustified prosecution.
Operations to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
Yesterday, the Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the largest economic bailout plan since the Great Crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use US$700 billion to hinder the financial crisis that has been clouding Wall Street for months now must be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of the chosen representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money imposed, new arrangements for capturing the number of houses seized for defaults, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to executives of rescued firms.
US Chancellor of the Exchequer Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the Negotiating Table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, following the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and come to an agreement that is effective in the markets," said Bush administration official, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis currently underway on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"That's a crucial point: if we don't, the trauma, the chaos, and disruption of Americans' daily lives will be enormous," said Jad Gregg, a Republican.
Over the past few hours, the negotiations have taken to the maximum turn for fear of the effect of further failure on the investor's mood.
The time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US president were invited to the negotiations later, and both were more likely to comment on the deal, but without rebuting their dissatisfaction, saying it had to be resorted to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added to the agreement on some of the measures, in particular to enable the owners of the residence to be retained, and the pay-as-you-go-run measures for the laboring state-resurited firms.
"When we ask the taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate themselves on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the TV waves.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, who was questioned by another station on whether to vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough traits I have read [proves] that it is something that we will all have to digest and use to move on.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The $700bn plan aims to buy back doubtful claims and risky and non-negotiable assets of US financial institutions with the taxpayer's money.
The plan comes after a 14-month crisis unleashing with the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a cash freeze on the banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of last week's first draft agreement is due to Republican members.
Ever since Democrats agreed to the government's guarantee for some of the "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty, but not to buy them, the belief is that the impasse is averted.
In an effort to approximate conflicting views in Congress, a measure has been added to stipulate that the government will be able to introduce new fees to help it get its deposit back if, as a result of the program, it has to take losses for five years.
The new plan envisages a first amount of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire stakes in rescued firms that will pay him dividends in the event of a profit and which he will be able to resell when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the seizure procedures for the loans related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits on the level of the valuation and compensation paid to the executives of the affected firms.
The architects of the plan would like to vote it in the House of Representatives as early as today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes continued to rise against this project in both the Republican and Democratic camp.
"It's very obvious that Washington can't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Commission, addressing voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But earning money in the taxpayers is not the solution."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen nicknamed the "Skeptics Committee," presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"The four hundred esteemed economics professors, among them the three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and to examine closely which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis was a world crisis.
Following the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of Fortis, the banking group, for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which is on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) as a result of a crisis in risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is one of Europe's top 20 banks and the top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that's what savers and households in these precarious times can appreciate."
On the other side of the Channel, the British government, meanwhile, appears to have begun nationalizing another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the branches and client accounts of the British bank will be purchased by the Spanish bank, the Spanish bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has had to nationalise since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - The Death of a Socially Engaged icon
His beauty, with his aura-eyed eyes, had long been his trump card, in other weaknesses.
Has this American actor disconnected with the charming reeling from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivities and relentless talents inherent in him also distressed him from the force category that breeds real stars.
However, what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83, at his ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer, and remains one of the last icons of the healing years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, who had been similar and for a long time to be a rival to his film-screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly a more fragile but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often breeds beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
These European roots were born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
Without an exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Seeing this entire country in love with self-formed mana, a fighter in the Pacific War, was seen in the battle, who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then attended New York's Actor's Studio and triumphed in theater, television and soon in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a racing driver who placed second at the 24-hour race at Le Mans in 1979, and a sexual symbol, despite having been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward.
With it, the shaded places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, go allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which will always remain, to some extent, mysterious.
A decent man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has made the film's lovers dizzy, while his big roles compete with each other on the black screen of memories.
It is after him that he has been paraded by the ever-changing American Seventh Art.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who revisits his voluptuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a Hot Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From the less distant past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at his advanced age by marriage that did not live up to all expectations.
So many of the other Pauls NewMans went down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, astrated, violent, unforgettable delinquent from the Somebody Up There Likes Me (In the Signs of Hate) by Robert Wis, a role for James Dean, taken after his death, which made Newman known in 1956.
A likeable gangster in the absolutely brilliant The Sting, the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
The bitter and vengeful poclad poclad player in Robert Rossen's astonishing The Hustler (1961), will portray the same character in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which will bring him the only Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face traveling for ages, that was him.
And him again.
In his career, different epochs compete with each other.
He is known to the young for George Roy Hill's cult Slap Shot (1977), from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans reunited with him in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers Coen.
He then tied his career as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends, which left the trade quite early on, Newman remained in the business for a long time, though he denounced Hollywood with his appetites, flamboyance, and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier regarded it, not without humour, "as a live appeal of the underplaying," judging that he pushed too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a dossier, the profession was not always as gentle.
But he played first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, crooks, and desperate, whose declines and rebellions reflected in his perfect features.
As director, Newman revealed the little-known pages of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (described to the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife, Joanne Woodward, is given a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
To his son Scott, who he lost due to an overdose, he dedicated the 1986 film Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness.
In the torrent of honours Newman's received yesterday, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said saddened, "His presence made my life and the better country."
The magnanimity, the love of life, such are the main characteristics of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great champion of civil rights, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of Hollywood's decline, is also leaving.
His likeness was used to seeing on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which we might find rather tasteless, though at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to his Hard-Children Foundation.
Newman, rather than be lulled by fame, was involved in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to be here."
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the career of a life as a prescient and magnanimous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Co. invoice factory?
Soon, 8. October, the trial will begin in the criminal proceedings against Yans Zuschlag and his associates.
The politician and his associates, in addition to other offences, including the forgery of the documents, are charged with fraud committed in a long-term and systematically criminal organisation, as a result of which the extremely significant damage was caused.
According to the prosecution, they used the money raised in the public tenders for their own purposes and often attested the performance of the tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and the municipalities - a total of around 65 million forints - went partly to the coffers of Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method, also reported by the Bureau of Investigation, was that the money received in the public tenders had been levied on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration, and never fell short of the association's commitments.
According to the indictment, a large portion of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names in which companies are to be made of invoices were decided, among other things, on a round trip along the northern bank of Balaton, to which he sent to István Lados János Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, the former was to look for boarding houses and restaurants.
In them, he applied for bills for his consumption, according to the modeling of which invoices submitted in the context of the tenders announced by, among others, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Samoo Governance of the Capital, respectively, were then produced.
The invoices were mostly exhibited by István Lados with his partner András Őrim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "studo-tour," Lados spotted a beer hall.
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this hospitality establishment provided catering for the 90-member group from the Biztos Pont association.
So many people, however, according to the company manager's claims, would not suddenly fit into the facility.
Similarly, the invoice issued by the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, was swarmed with formal and content errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaya had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet a hundred and thirty guests were shown on the invoice.
However, fillers of the form of a rich fantasy were overreacted even when they listed on the documents of a company dedicated to the hospitality industry - Pigal s. r. o., in the accounts of which, according to the information provided to the prosecutor's office, the documents in the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even be included.
The head of the firm, Győző Farkas, said that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place."
As he added, apart from the formalities, they did not agree to accommodate a hundred people, as they had only eleven rooms that did not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice was also shown to be cared for, while their restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The outrageous invoicing manufacturers were not convinced that the prospective Budapest travel agency was only organizing foreign trips, and on an invoice with a cash payment, which was also not agreed with the company's billing practice, they foolishly said as a service to arrange a trip to Hungary.
In addition, as the investigation revealed in the course of the investigation, they also stated VAT in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was released from VAT.
On the four documents exhibited at the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. disagreed, among other things, the amount of VAT. The company's activities are not covered by the 25 per cent, but by 15 per cent VAT, in addition to the hotel's employees issued only the printed invoices, but the invoice produced was written in hand.
In addition, they spoiled the "issuers" invoice by, for example, saying at one of the firms, as the prosecution's investigation into the prosecution, such as the activity of road transport carried out by the company found not to hold investment advice.
That the invoices are issued by the Egyptütt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért and the XXI associations. The Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont false, was also bailed out because of formal deviations - the inadequate format of the invoice and the false stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose leaders denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the forgeries did not notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyházy was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating at it, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he had issued the paper.
Invoices were subjected consciously
The second set of invoices are those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation issued some four million forint bills for Harmadik Évezredért at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The head of Collab s. r. o. was prompted, according to the indictment, by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi, to issue a fictitious account.
Zuschlag and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s. r. o, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied Jobb Jövőért and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth some five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Nor the movement of the money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which the organizations have already forgotten to put in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies includes those with ties to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov was the commissioned representative of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trio s. r. o., a fuel and motor vehicle, based in Budapest, on which the company is not to be found.
The company issued several invoices in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of IT funds worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s.r.o., which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The company's manager was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was to hand over the company's documents in 2002-2005.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that he had issued invoices to the Atlasz, Hoppá and the foundation of Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért and accepted their worth of assessment himself.
In fact, at the request of Iván Kubatov, the Romanian masokies were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r.o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, neither of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Yet the businesses were of good use to him, as he issued invoices to the Atlasz and Y YEY-affiliated lawyer's request, Zsolt Szente, on behalf of the companies, invoices to the Atlasz and Y-Generáció affiliated with Zuschlag.
On behalf of the firms Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organisations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor's office decided that Kubatov had come in at 10 percent of the sums on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the selection process for Biztos Pont, the man also used Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországogért submitted proposals for the Mihálye Táncsicse (TMA) Foundation for the Public Competition.
They received 500,000 forintech each, but did not spend the sums on the targets set out in the proposals.
To make it out, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were, after all, found during a search at the office of Árpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the production of invoices, as she had already done at the prosecution.
It may be interesting if the lead defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything.
His testimony to date is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times to unload everything at length, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for paying for a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the Socialists have made a deal with him, and Zus will take the blame.
Indeed, he could have been even offended so far, as his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, namely to be placed under house arrest, remained out of the question.
While the perpetrators of the economic crimes who have done much more damage that they have not yet paid for are free to walk or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have that option.
The psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been uncovered by researchers in the field of neurology and economics at the University of New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don't want to lag behind in the eBay auction-type competition, so they'd rather pay too high a price.
The research, using an experimental auction, attempted to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers grated, the other group participated in a mock auction, using the functional magnetic resonance molding method (fMRI) to examine the active areas of the brains of the test subjects.
In both games, the participants could have won the money, but in the game of the auction, the important element of which is to outmaneuver the other side, the whole found under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, began to work intensively in the loss.
This brain area plays a role in the "self-referricisation" mechanism of the nervous system, in addition to many other functions.
The unscrewing of the price is therefore possible, according to the researchers, to be explained by the effort to avoid the stride reaction of the striata.
To shore up their theory, members of the research team surveyed the economists' financial cross-cutting investigation.
In it, under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the fair value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the group were promised that if they emerged victorious, they would receive an extra $15 as a reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss its members lost that money as well.
The difference between the two groups was therefore all about the fact that one was emphasised by a win and another by a loss.
The members of the group playing "against the loss," of course, were willing to go higher than they were in a control and "victorious" group, which confirms the neurologists' hypothesis.
"These results cannot be deduced from any pre-existing economic theory.
For these have until now explained the phenomena observable at auctions with the joys of victory and the avoidance of risk.
It was only the neurological imaging methods that helped us resolve the contradiction between the two theories so that we have now come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of Economics at the University of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, while in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only 7,000 of them are being treated. The cause of this is that the sick often do not know they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary of the name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, characterised by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the agents of the disease and the diseases they cause are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruss are spreading in two main ways, depending on the originator of the disease: hepatitis A and E digestive tract (for example, infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses in blood and bodily fluids (sperm, poppory secretions, spit saline).
In any case, travellers should be protected by vaccinating A and B, and there is no vaccine against the C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after taking infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, urges to vomit.
The skin and the whites of the eye are then made of jaundice, the lightened stool and darkened the urine. The treatment can take two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people die worldwide from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that only one in ten of the infected is being treated medically for.
hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the infected do not even know about their illness, the genres of the disease are being destroyed by the liver cells insidiously, and so the first symptoms do not come in many cases until 20-30 years.
That is why early prevention, the implementation of regular depistage, is very important.
In three groups, the disease occurs a lot more frequently than on average: between people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
Currently, the projected global number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
As the disease can already be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his or her general practitioner if he or shears any sign of unknown origin.
When detected early, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing contagion and preventing cancer from developing.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, which was organised by the organisations with the sufferers for the first time globally in 2004.
It aims to draw attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Benelux Governments to be nationalised by Fortis Bank
The Benelux states will be helped by the Belgian-Dutch bank, Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble because of the spreading effect of the US mortgage market crisis, with partial nationalities: the three countries will support a €11.2 billion in capital participation in Hungary.
This was agreed at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to have been in a major crisis in the wake of the crisis in the international financial markets, which has been spreading in the waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken on this issue could be considered as precedents from a certain point of view.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy up almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets.
The bank will sell part of its capital holdings with absolute certainty, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Shares in Fortis began to plummet rapidly fall last week, with serious signs of crisis appearing in the institute in the second half of the week.
But analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company's securities fell 12 percent on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the group's total market share capital is around €14 billion, but this is unrealistic, according to the company's leaders.
Indeed, the company's management blames the collapse of Fortis's shares in uncertainty in the overseas market surrounding the adoption of the $700 billion US package plan.
By Monday, the stock had risen slightly.
On Friday, the new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to lead the bank.
The cash institute was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government had previously announced that investors did not have to worry, they would not lose their money.
Panic has not yet broken out among the bank's clients and the branches have not been stormed by storm.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also bought up several leasing firms.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that could make it easier for the death of the already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how a person's belief in the god of perception of pain influences, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks, while all of them observed the painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic faithful were able to rule out much of the pain.
The technique detailing the human brain also showed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain regulating.
The research is the first of a series of research that, alongside academics, involving scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
Exactly the test was done by attaching a sparkling instrument to the test subject's left hand, which was making electric shocks.
Researchers asked the participants in the experiment to stare at two paintings: Sassoferrat's Virgin Mary from the 17th Century and the Lady with the Baso da Vinci, a facet, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would provoke a state of piety among the faithful, while they chose da Vinci's painting because it was not much different from the first and appearing to be reassuring.
The experimental bodies spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electroshock parts in four consecutive parts, while separately following a religious or general image.
The Catholics said that the sight of the Virgin Mary felt "safe" as if they had been "taken cured" and "calmed down, peace fulfilled them."
Watching the religious-themed image, they felt 12 percent less pain than they did when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by any strongly impressive image even in atheists, just a good photograph must be found.
"We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of the mother or the father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Pregnoding of faith should change and, in many cases, change our personality as well," Wright added.
After such brilliant results, it's just a question of what effect it would have to be on regulating the pain of the faithful if they showed them any Madonna by Leonardo or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would the view of the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You're what you're gonna share
About his tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as they can in the sky over their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examinations they attend and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's not enough.
However, as far as the skeptics make the parallel with the Orwellian dark vision, they are not exactly clear at the very essence of the 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently commented to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable Google's founders to stick to their original intention, which was, "Let's keep all the information in the world!"
According to a commissioned Google official, the company is only at the beginning to work with all the information after ten years of world-breaking work.
Asked what would happen in five years' time, Schmidt said he would like to see Google's answering questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would actually be appropriate for me?" - but the software will not be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until they know enough about users.
Not all internet users know well that during the internet search, the searched for words are accurately captured from what IP address they were searched for and to which pages the interested parties moved after the search.
For example, thanks to Personalized Search, launched two years ago, users can keep a history of their surfing, can retrospectively see what they were looking for and what they click on, which then generates findings adapted much more directly to them in the long term - the same logic will be based on the service, through which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously stated and preserved preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - asks users who are afraid when looking at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is more formidable, with the anti-reaction not proving guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the searched terms are not only captured, but can also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users are not protected.
The most well-known example of recent times was perhaps a coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community site, set up through it.
But Internet users who are worried about personality rights, were still in relief in May when the firm, hand-in-hand with the EFF's e-author's e-author's organisation, successfully proved its truth in the dispute with the FBI: so Google must not be forced to provide any article of the Constitution in the future to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought for nearly fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand searched terms, which it obtained, citing the reinforcement of the years-long Child Protection Act, but still failing to get the lists of wanted items for individual users, or full lists of websites and keywords, including a period of two months.)
The view of Google is thus rather contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear to provide their personal data because they feel that their intimate realm and private life will be exposed to their intimate spheres by using Google's services, and oppose it with the revolt of the kind of multinational firms with a conservative image.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild offshoot, grouping around enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users, appearing in many countries, see it as a new generation of big business, "corporation, what's now hot," unlike his rival Microsoft, considered the world's conqueror of the world, however they both fight for the same goals.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want them to have money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information, and a package of programs feels much more affordable, more youthful, "coollique" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship of the Internet and personality rights that has brought with it one of the most swulse keywords of recent years: the web 2.0.
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is about nothing more than collaborating, about deliberately keeping behind the trail and using the communication channels at our disposal, and although their range is different for each, the essence remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can keep a profile on several community-based Facebook pages from Facebook to Xang, which they can easily link to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording the music listened to it, all of which they can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to which he can automatically write a blog on which his latest photo galleries, which will be automatically posted on Flickr or Picas.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of specimen cases from which she reveals: a friend in the morning, looking at the floods of pictures of their friends in common, it easily comes to the point of who her sheer boyfriend spent the evening with, or the company can fire his worker just because he recounts his sincere opinion on his blog about the top management: one thing is certain, the notion of private life has been completely reassessed today.
The one who lives life is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to conceal something, or at least avoid a google monopoly, he has the option (starting with Scroogle, for example, who uses Google's search system, but does not deliberately leave traces).
For example, a small number of people are not deliberately registered on the community site so that they cannot be found. Google's online apps from a text editor to a photo editor and a news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to the giant server parks and which do not form the highest quality possible profile.
Public opinion is not very secretly awaiting when Google will show the teeth.
The business, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($111 billion), advertising space AdWords/AdSense is threatened by investment by advertising agencies, and services implemented at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously making life more difficult for not only Microsoft, but also to numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find counter-concepts acting unsettling: for example, the senior management, for example, has completely rejected workers' protests after it has raised a fee for a company nursery to double, the arbitrarily frequent daily catering of employees, according to the company's management, all of which is lost, but all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and filters out any find that contrary to the good taste or interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, only when they can be used, but what is certain is that the expected problems of the months and years for years may be turning the world around new places: while some believe that Google's project on scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such proportions that the company will soon be dealing with the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of its Health system, in which we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors, and problems.
The fact that Google compils a genetic database can then serve as a good source material for subsequent generations of sci-fi writers, the famous novel by Cory Doctorow "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences the future, in which one can be harmed with a deterrent just using Google data.
The two-time assassin from the OW helped to remove the tracks of two juveniles
Two juveniles were interviewed by police in the case of a double murder in the OW, who were believed to have assisted with the removal of the traces of this crime, a spokesman for the High Police Headquarters Borsod said on Tuesday.
Those concerned have confessed to the activities of the suspected activity and are currently charged with aiding and abetting a crime.
Both juveniles, according to MTI information, two girls are being prosecuted at large.
The committing of the crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in the OW, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of the crime of pre-planned multiple murders for self-interested reasons.
During the investigation, it emerged that the 23-year-old young man owed a larger sum to the 53-year-old.
The suspect would not repay his debt, so he lured his creditor to one of the premises in Ózdu last Wednesday, where he killed the man first and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was preparing for the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder by a gun hidden at the scene of the crime.
Both the weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a 100 percent block of shares in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the range of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 per cent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 reports, the bid for Poles represents the highest amount offered to the bidder for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted a bid.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, commented last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of any bidder, and did not rule out the possibility that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholder agreement, around 90 per cent of the shares could be sold off.
The biggest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with an approximately 25 percent share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r. a.l. with 13.5 percent.
About the Financial Crisis in the Looking ahead to the European papers
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading papers are already reminiscent of "the second 9/11" paper.
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the US President, the accusations are being made by Rome's La Repubblica. The president has not even been able to rally his own party in support of that hastily sprawled bill to correct this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, who was reminiscent of billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we might be more likely to talk about the second 9/11.
He also sees a section of the Madrid press as the culprit in Washington.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the world economy has been brought to the brink of collapse by its lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system continues to grow, for which the world will eventually pay.
While Bush's plan was not perfect, there is a danger after the congressional vote that Washington will not offer a political tool to address the crisis.
The world economy is in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is underway.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline into a bounty on the staggering financial institutions, and taxpayers can save them from ruin.
But if other banks collapse like the dominoes, then neither the funds nor other improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move through their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the post-ending financial institutions received more than €100 billion, recalls Vienna's Der Standard, saying that fears that, like Americans, in order to address the crisis, European taxpayers will have to dig deep into their pockets, are increasingly realistic.
The European Union has not yet seriously addressed the crisis, which is being taucus rolled out by the old continent.
"Paramedics" do not have to immediately wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be a good idea if they set themselves firmly, in which case it is sensible to reach for taxpayers' money to avoid even more damage.
Intelligent car imitates bumblebee flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collision, if not imitaten, of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
The initial strategic idea of a surprise project, presented at the CEATEC trade fair in Japan, was given to Nissan by the unmarginal engineers. It was about building a new generation of precipitation systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed a biomimetic robotic management system of BR23C, a robotized minicar that is equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective cover," explained Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand for technology PR and R&D.
Composite eyes play an important role, allowing bees to bee in all directions in the field of view of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eye, the engineers reached for the idea of a laser telecomer.
This identifies the obstacles up to 2 metres before the BR23C in the field of view of 180 degrees, calculate their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into a collision-mastering operation.
The barrier is picked up in a split second, then begins to imitate the bee's movements and turn the wheels needed to prevent the collision immediately change direction.
Unlike any existing system, this folding maneuver is in an absolutely instinctive way.
"If that were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Car Project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of safety protective packaging within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The process must be reflected in what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
This process must not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction that can be turned the wheels.
Thus, instead of the endless options offered to the bees when avoiding, the robotic car was only applied to the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and slowing.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer lifespan than the lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, the instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, are important, much less data storage.
This mechanism must only be processed and responded to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to store and respond using an intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so he is constantly using only a memory of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memorization with giga- or megaabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing instant evasive technology, which Nissan estimates could get into mass-produced cars within a decade.
Another application option may be a connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding the path of the obstacle, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
The curdly expensive child already has a name
The $700 billion Rescue Economy Package Act, to be divided into several instalments and aimed at buying back bank shoddy loans, is already in writing.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further negotiations, which ended after midnight US Eastern time on Saturday, Congressional officials reached an agreement in a days-long debate on a rescue package worth a total of $700 billion, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, according to which all that remains is the drafting of the agreement.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said of the compromise result: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps are needed."
The written form of the package was released before the Asian markets opened on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (at 2 a.m. Central European Time on Monday), but did not cause any special rise in the stock markets.
The draft legal standard, hearing the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act of 2008, which is to be established by the program, will be voted first on the House of Representatives on Monday, then the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, after which news of the deal was also welcomed to the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made at night, and we are very much appreciative of the efforts of both sides to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
Indeed, the program differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, which was to make the entire $700 billion spent on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of 700 billion in the first around the first, so that the $250 billion will be used immediately after the matter is expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Treasury Department will purchase for them the securities secured by the mortgages, which are rated as of the low-quality, fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the president's decision.
The programme will be audited by a special body, which will also be a member of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on Congress's next decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy back poor quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, respectively other "single" loans.
The buyout can take place both in the auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the ministry said.
The legal standard will allow the firms concerned to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Treasury will provide them with a guarantee for funds presenting cause for concern, for which the company will then pay the price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system, whether it be a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or preventing the systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank executives who have run into trouble and are waiting for the help of the state can count on the government to lower their severance package - which is simply called a "golden parachute" in overseas slang.
Their payouts will be reduced only in certain cases, in addition to these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry buys as part of the auction, the golden parachutes will be subject to a tax surcharge if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of a direct purchase of poor-quality loans, the government will act aggressively in order to avoid excessive money for the management.
It should be added that the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the restriction only applies to new ones, which is to be a further stimulus to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history to have a statutory cap on the remuneration of CEOs," commented the provision of the chairman of the Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives, a Democrat, Democrat, Barney Frank.
In addition, the state will have a right to share in the banks participating in the programme, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as soon as the economy and the bank rescued with it, they can also make a profit on the move.
The draft plan includes that in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal to show to Congress how the expected financial-sector losses can be returned to taxpayers.
On both sides, of course, there were also voices expressing doubts about the plan.
"This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, because this is not what the taxpayer's dollars will protect," said Republican Congressman from California, Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, reckons that the adoption of the provision was urged by those responsible for the Wall Street collapse.
Industrial prices rose further
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 due to the previous month, up 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported.
The export sales prices in the industry were up by 1.1 percent compared to July 2008, down 3.9 percent year-on-year.
Manufacturing prices in the industry were 0.7 percent higher as a cause of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, up 3.2 percent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry rose only minimally, by 0.1 percent, given the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly compared to July, by 0.1 percent, compared to July.
The biggest price increase was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear sectors (2.8 per cent), mainly due to a monthly increase in prices in the gamboo and saddlery products sector by 4.6 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials was due to a significant monthly increase in prices in the production of chemical materials and products (1.6 percent).
The price cuts were in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electric machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimal extent - in the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in the field of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured the price increase in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water distribution sector, which weigh heavily in domestic sales to the industry, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the ongoing impact of the officially established gas price increase taking place from 1. July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of manufacturing, prices rose the most in the technical oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking production sector, it was possible to observe a 13.2 per cent, in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which have a decisive weight gain, an 11 per cent price increase.
Prire cuts occurred in the textile and textile product production sectors (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water distribution sectors surpassed the prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of subdivisions by sector orientation, domestic sales were shown in the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) in the domestic sales in the sectors involved in the production of tangible assets.
In the consumer goods industries, prices rose by 0.3 percent, in processing-producing energy and further processing sectors, prices were unchanged in the light of the previous month.
The largest price increases given the same month of the year ahead could be seen in August 2008 in the energy-producing industries and the further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).

The next year, no visa to the United States?
According to Kingy Göncz, there is a strong hope that the US-Hungarian Visa Waiver Agreement will come into force around January 12, with the Minister of State's Minister speaking about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "now almost everything matters just if an electronic system of permitting journeys and checks, respectively, is built up in time overseas."
At the same time, she pointed out that there would be no entry permit as part of the new system, but tourists would have to register before leaving.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy is continuing negotiations in Washington as of today.
He will meet with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit to the Republic of Hungary and conduct interviews with foreign policy advisors to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of a bailout package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major US parties, agreed to support the government's $700 billion bail-out package on Sunday, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a marathon of several days of negotiations by Congress and administration officials, it was announced early on Sunday morning: a basic agreement was reached on the bank rescue package.
The financial package, which aims to translate the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain have consistently described themselves as the more suitable of the two candidates to take the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, at the same time as economic issues came to the forefront, Obama won some of the advantage again, and McCain's lead, which he secured after the Republican convention of nominating Sarah Palin for the post of vice-president, was dissipated.
Obama expressed hope at a pre-election rally in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages on consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) to your places, your jobs, the whole industry, the stability of the whole economy, the stability of the whole economy in danger," he said in front of the 35,000-strong crowd.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy outdated.
In an interview given to the ABC television station, McCain said: "It will abhor all a bit (...) but doing nothing is just a possible way."
As the Republican senator said, the proposal features the establishment of a commissioning the supervising Treasury Secretary and a reduction in the severance pay for the top officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had not had a more substantial role in the negotiations, and he himself had been in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill perhaps as early as Monday.
List of printing of the German language field
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so it analyses the weak CSU's weak result in Bavaria, Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the Red and Black and Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article "The Moravian Revolution Enaves His Fathers" the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began a long time before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over.
For decades, the Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria - and now it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
The rotation of the period is a problem for all of Christian democracy, and thus to Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process ended, which could be assumed for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one statesman's end.
Already a decade ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent threshold.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the so often commemorated Stoiber period.
The cause is a modernisation that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country, which is devouring to its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at the pace. But secularization, educational outcomes, the resettlement of Germans from the east and the north in the emerging regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequence for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is linked to the growth of options, which has its visible political implications.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more willful.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, it is the classical civic classics that have moved the CSU most apart; the people of the liberal profession, the tradesmen, the individuals with the graduation and the university education.
This has already shrunk to CSU support below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepressse.com)
The conservative Vienna Journal was in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The party leaders are reticent on the coalition's issues" devotes the puzzled domestic political situation to the result of the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ's interference in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ appears open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to negotiate a coalition.
The election is over, now it all revolves around the Coalition; in a debate held on public television, the party chairmen did not give each other much insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - in some Länder and in social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, was left open to Faymann.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was outvoted at any rate.
Repeating this is out of the question.
Molterer responded to the red offers with caution.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
The President of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, appeared again open in all directions.
"To prevent the Red and Black and Black Coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóková: It is necessary to break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Equality Summit hosted by France, the current presiding state of the European Union, has begun in Paris today.
As one of the main speakers of the professional deliberation, Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, turned her attention to segregation in education, as one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, as well as the most serious obstacle to their application.
The summit was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
For the deliberations, they sat among the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil society's equal opportunities organisations.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, Fidesz Járóková pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of the workforce, the Roma are being pushed out of the European labour market primarily through their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of primary education, only a tiny proportion of them can attain a higher level of education."
Járóková further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MP, it is necessary to confirm the consciousness of these connections in the broadest circles - among both Roma and non-Romani children.
Indeed, the sooner a Romani student starts school, the better chances he or she will have of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise duties, they contribute to the national budget.
"Romani people are the right of their citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to a quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, the European Union's cohesion with an emphasis on the aim and the negotiations to immediately speed up the processes of the desegregation of schools is needed, which is of paramount importance for this, the right observance of both existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is of paramount importance.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to give Romani children the possibilities given by the democratic space so that they can participate in the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóková demanded.
For everyone, as a sign of the 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, is to be provided with a separate forum conducive to the achievement of the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set out at European and national level.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people's data on the purchase of medicines, often dismiss the possibility of entering into an insurance contract with a candidate.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
'There is a data protection programme which binds the use of drug prescribing data in any case to the permission of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the hen to the fox," the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, the author of the prescribing prescription program.
Insurance companies make premiums and amounts paid in case of insurance claims are dependent on the health of candidates, and if the risk is assessed as too large, the insurance will not even close with it.
Previously, they sent in question to medical examinations and entered into a contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick devised a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer from the pharmacies could easily find out what drugs the subject had bought for the past year and a half, from which the program would draw out of his or her illness, and what his health was.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, this refers to the fact that he has virtually uncontrollably high blood levels, which immediately categorizes him in the higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some determining the risk coefficient at the same time, so the insurance company has almost no work left to do except paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The drawbacks is that many medicines can be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, usable against migraine or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
These pose, from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, a significant risk-enhancing factor, whereas the former's problems are not.
Special companies have been created for the purpose of requesting and processing the data and requesting permission from the patient before obtaining the necessary information from pharmacies before obtaining the information they need.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their negligence to date.
Some companies have recently been processing the results of laboratory examinations that link it to the data on the drugs used, which allows them to provide an even more accurate picture of the patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, while checking their use will become more and more difficult to control.
There is a special law to protect health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
A bill that will give authorities the power to inspect businesses specialising in providing data is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: so he developed his program to be linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the person's permission can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the hens are, after all, somewhat dependent on the fox's goodwill.
CSU: Temporary Pardon
The fate of the serving duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, the heads have not yet fallen, the debate on personal issues has so far been adjourned by the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and the country's Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
Members of the highly criticized duo have in any case been told that they will not hold their strength in their posts.
They attempted to reassure the enraged members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Hemetor Tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of her career - the Christian-Social Union won 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but her strength was only good enough for 43.4 percent.
The CSU was a "sammonger" in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
While the conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance for the Hungarian economy, continue to be in a high position, they will in any case be forced into a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of intra-party reorganization is that a member of the narrow intelligence team to begin probe negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or the right-leaning Free Voters group, will also be the deputy chairman and federal agriculture minister, Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic to the fate that Gabriele Pauli, who was made to the assembly on the Free Voter's ticket, whose appearance against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the coup, but then made a mercilessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilise Beckstein.
In the transition period, the active role will also go to Stoiber, who until now has spun the threads from the background, with the former country's prime minister and the former CSU president calling the bitterest day of his political career on September 28.
On Monday, Huber made some sarcastic remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from their sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor if the CSU, which played a major role in its national success in 2005, will not be on its feet by joint forces.
According to Merkel, who found it difficult to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the Social Democrats' crisis is continuing.
The SPD achieved the weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenko:opozice - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, not a single opposition member made it to the Belarusian parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the well-being and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the illegalities that took place in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-seat legislature of the 10m million country has been missing the opposition for a long time, the opposition, affiliated under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's election, seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had resumed his presidential mandate on the basis of a change in the constitution in the debate and, on the fourth time, to resume his presidential mandate, this time "allowed" for several opposition MPs to appear in parliament.
The ODS also abandoned the earlier boycott.
In the background to the opposition's expectations, Belarus was that Russia's increasingly economically dependent Belarus - which had taken credit to mitigate the impact of Russia's ever-increasing natural gas import and contributed to Beltransgaz, which owns the pipelines passing the country, to get into the hands of Russia - to improve relations with the European Union, to improve relations with the European Union, where, because of the Belarusian political establishment, judged by the anti-democratic Lukashenko, and other high-ranking politicians do not receive an initial permit.
The release was previously pointed out by the fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, emphasized positive shifts and not shortcomings - for example, banning the candidacy for a third of the opposition candidates.
Monday's flash report by the OSCE, however, already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press, especially to the opposition's failure to hold the vote count.
At the same time, the opposition says improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow as well as minor confrontations when he continues to refuse to recognize the secedes of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a union state on paper, has considered the two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to keep it that way, even though it has "fledgling too much to let a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament."
Looking at the opposition's results, it does not plan protest actions, rather it is trying to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with that, of course, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is put in the way of the local authorities, but I can still see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the older ones," Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which sees the creation of social safety as its greatest success, does not consider the right or officially supported layer of pensioners to be the correct or officially supported class of pensioners.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social safety of the 'reporting silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers viewed the election as democratic.
The head of the U.S. Union Independent States Mission, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words but actions," so the absence of the opposition is nothing more than evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are mutual leading trading partners, the subject was dominated by other, largely global challenges, the agenda for the ninth-level summit meeting.
There will also be a Franco-Indic Summit today, which will primarily discuss cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
Indeed, the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak to international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to find a common denominator to support New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even further discussed at yesterday's, already ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current president of the Union, and the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso and the High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solano, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the turnover of trade within five years, or would rise to more than a hundred billion euros.
With the exchange of goods rising from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, it is not an overly ambitious target.
As a sign of this, twenty-six bilateral agreements already in existence with India on civil aviation were aligned, so that air transport was given the green light in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, with New Delhi ranking only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, respectively - both sides have been condemned in all its forms and called for the swift convening of the UN conference.
They also morgoned the end of the Doha business round, although both have a large part in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as well as the fact that next year's climate conference would require a global agreement and gas production to reduce greenhouse-effect greenhouse by 50 percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
India's prime minister arrives today in the French capital, where he is planning to do business in a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
Paris believes that the mandate to build India's nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros will be won by French firms.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
The large participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair awaits more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred different countries to see the 171,790 sqm of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen as a guest of honour for Turkey.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy will in fact attend institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square metres of the exhibition area.
A meeting with the press in Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0 will be the following: it will be an opportunity to introduce numbers, tendencies and perspectives in terms of the state of the publishing house in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books by foreign authors in relation to the overall Italian production is still diminishing, mainly given the literature for children and adults.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
This is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a revolving door was introduced when staff members arrived and gone.
But from today, this new measure will start to work against the shrewd people, against those who inject and then go for coffee during working hours.
The novelty against the lazyes was launched today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"The squeaky door - says Brunett - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more full-time and more services" the minister clarifies.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency will now be opened.
This is about reformism," stresses Brunette.
We will complete the Chigi Palace with the introduction in all the buildings of the council's Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the employees, the secretary-general assures: "This was a joint procedure with the workers and the cooperation of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and a croissant.
The brunette smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning."
During a conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will eventually announce that during the three months the absence of public servants for the illness has decreased by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people a year at work."
And he will add that it is imperative that the Italian public administration become more efficient
"its pay-as-you-go dynamics – the minister explains – has doubled in the last 8-10 years, given the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage'.
In the meantime, thousands of public servants have gathered to reject the standards of the Brunett decree in accordance with the Codacons-supported request.
"While the Public Administration Secretary today unveils the figures on the lower absence from work due to illness - writing to the consumer protection association - the 'dilutive Lings' Natione is growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and fair public service staff who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree."
Tara will be particularly opposed to the exclusion of sickness benefit allowances that depend on the activity; the extension of the time at which the patient can be checked for the time frame in which the inspection visits will be carried out and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Industrial accidents, Napolitano: "Resistance Prevention"
Every day, 2,500 work-related accidents happen in Italy, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail's Inail values confirm that for 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths as a result of accidents at work.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main reasons for death and causes almost twice the death toll compared to the murders.
To reaffair the attention of the institutions, social and information means of information about this dramatic problem, Anmil is today celebrating in all Italian regions the 58th national victim of child trauma victims set for the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmilem and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the important issue of job security," confirms the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a report sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association for Crippled and Invalids for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his vivid admiration for the constant joint efforts to ensure safety in jobs, to protect the injured workers, to help the families of the victims and to complicity of public opinion.".
"Natically, an outraged 'enough' has been raised, genuinely shared in the face of the tragedies, which are causing a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion in their scope, but the day-to-day reality once again offers us dramatic cases, even recurring in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particularly important are the asterisk initiatives pushed for education to give young people facing the world's work more clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up on its worrisome social seriousness, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
The president of the chamber, Gianfranco, stressed to Fini on his part, "how the phenomenon of death resulting from an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social condition, how it offends each of us's conscience and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to bring about the necessary cessation of this state of affairs.".
"As for data on work-related accidents, they appear to be showing some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from a work-related accident is equally alarming," President Anmil Pietro Mercandelli noted again.
"We would not want this "trash-track" to lead to less attention, because just as the attention ceases, tragedy sets out.
"We believe that there is generally too little to stop the problem of injuries, and there are many activities that can have an impact on the problem.
It is essential, in our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training for staff, from the school age."
"Fourish efforts are needed - he added - in terms of communication and participation of public opinion.
But it is mainly necessary to make a greater sense of responsibility by employers to the phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon ."
Mercandelli eventually said it was a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation presumed for work victims and the "deflection of supportive care" that the system has been receiving in recent years."
"The goal, then, is to return the worker's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who hurt must not depend on spontaneity or gifting by the legislator from time to time."
Mp3 players charged, expose hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and use portable music devices as Mp3 players can be caused by permanent hearing damage.
According to a European Commission notice published today, which, in an official report, extended in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Committee on Science of the Health Risks, which has recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion, we read the notes, it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music for at least five years, more than an hour a day a week, and keep the machine at high volume, risking a permanent loss of auditory ability."
"It worries me that such a large number of young people who use often portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an incorrigible way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - the leader goes on - show a clear risk and a rapid response is needed.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific findings in order to make them entirely effective and to keep pace with the new technology'.
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committe to explore this problem in view of the high use of portable music machines and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists - concluded by the Executive Officer of the Eu - confirm that it is necessary to worry and now the European Commission will examine, together with the other members and parties, which have raised the problem of what measures could possibly be put in place and thus better protect children and young people from exposing the noise, the source of which is portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard already in place, which limits the noise level of portable music machines to 100 dB, but concerns are mounting about hearing impairment, which may be caused by an over-exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to very limit these damages by looking for solutions such as a reduction in the level and duration of the exposure.
In its beliefs, the Eu Scientific Committee states that users of portable music appliances, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to maximum permitted workplace noise.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for an extended period of time risking permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their amount can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Alemanno will leave the commission for the future of the capital
We will start today, close in March, we will have sums in June.
Such is the Campidoglium calendar to the "City of the City of Rome" staff, which met this morning at its new headquarters outside the Caracal Lázně.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and another 49 members of the commission will set up a guidebook for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included - it wants to emphasise Alemanno - It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political arbitrators that remain Giunta e the Municipal Council.
It is not about replacing the functions, but only about trying to have a place to process a major project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved because the institution must have a precise time date.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome'.
Anyone who accuses the Commission of futility, as its opinion will not be binding, Alemanno will say: "It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as are the Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics is sprawled on everyday problems and on the urgencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective , work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary undertaking nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not be the cost or the euro and will serve to reflect and engage in the best intelligence that the capital has."
For Alemann, basically, "a strategic sketch must be taken as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, to allow our city to take an authentic rise at the level it badly needs and think with a unified spirit for its future."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome, clarifies "will not be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further away" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? First anti-American president. It's already known why
A well-known US president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as a private citizen today) with the enemy of Islam."
Attacks against Obama are mounting just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he will get to the highest post of nation, which had two governors and five black senators!."
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; are they clearly attacks of racial origin, and they don't answer the voter's question: will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; everyone says that Obama will win and by a wide margin.
Even in this case, there are those who act by the heart and not by the brain.
One newspaper from the Mississippi, from the bowels of the south of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the election stall, we know well who an American patriot will give his vote to.
One of the pages of the American mentality will come out to the outcry, which remained skytarious until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll eventually take care of it ourselves, who to tick, whether to Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost a certain success for the black candidate.
But for all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? Eighty-nine percent said: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks up his ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq became a weakness for most of Bush's.
Who will take the place of Georgia W will have to do a huge task.
The US economic collapse was also felt by journalists: the day is the investigation period in the paper. And many blame the internet, the "killer" with the press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the premisses of the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say that they had less to worry about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis-stricken economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put together the newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists surveyed, this is a problem that needs to be resolved, if we do not want traditional journalism to be fundamentally changed as understood by the general public.
The American journalist is permeated by clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and the executive seniors believe that journalism is going the wrong way on the national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the site is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the internet, which many view as a "killer" of the press.
The "Economic Press" to which journalists point out increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists surveyed admitted to resorting to technology in the hope of "perpeting up for their journalism."
The biggest gate of American journalism is among those who manage newsrooms – that is, the leaders – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while the value at the local level drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "workcere certainty" for someone.
The leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are 47% at the national level.
As for journalists, they're at 30%.
As for the "certain work" involving the staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still a daily occurrence.
Only 13% of journalists are working on a contract.
In a nation as vast as Usa, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the internet, employers often offer what they want, so it is a question of taking or leaving.
The executives almost always get huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month outside of paying for pensions and insurance.
As regards holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confessions, often get sickftensed over the course of one year.
It is merely a climate issue.
UNIPOL: JUDGET IN THE DETAY, DANILO COPPOLA IN GROTTAFERRATOR
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the filing of real estate businessman Daniel Coppola, who asked to be able to move from his city, the Grottaferrats, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the counter-internment in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he received his release from house arrest last week, which was converted into forced permanent residency in Grottaferrata.
His attorneys, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, have asked that a real estate entrepreneur be able to change his whereabouts from rural town to capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against to whom he expressed pm)d'd allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accusing him of.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon was already reflected a few days ago, when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the rescue plan to provide the $700 billion presented by the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving economics.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is tearing up the Republican side, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, gentler, federal institution-friendly and business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to the "ment of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the states in the central and south.
The soul that arrogantly manifested itself in the vote I spoke about at the beginning.
But this particular thing is just cited is merely an example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to be an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which have been compacted in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactivation, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the double category State-Umia in relation to a certain nationalisation of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis in banking-funded institutions that, of course, have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in a single country are included to the greatest extent.
Which created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families, which are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be the world's economically, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalities seem to be substantially out of the picture or that it has nothing much to add: the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies, has been given, and which cannot opt for one common political line.
And so everyone is facing the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: the moment we get into distress, only the states have economic resources, a multitude of financial resources, to be able to try to get things right.
And also the necessary means and authorizers to use them: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances that perhaps no market and any international organisation will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphaticism, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, in complete harmony with the increasing importance that attempts to attribute the latest economic advances to one factor closely associated with it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of vita, increasingly sophisticated technology, imaterial, while we were convinced that the global finances had already been destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to be increasingly grappled with such poor, immense things like water, grain, naphtha.
All the things that would be said can be transported from one place to the ground to the other, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to the bounded area, the territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler has a lot more cards up their sleeve than who isn't, and who's unlucky to live in a place without grain, without diesel or water.
I'm getting to the second news, which foresees a break.
Who talks about the territory, the state, the government, inevitably talks about politics, that is, about leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objectively need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone to take up the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditability to existing leadership, especially economic, which has proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, unsettling: discrediting, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
Indeed, it seems to be increasingly widespread in the broad masses of the population of beliefs than their actions as the ideas of the hitherto popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the truest sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership avenges one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to remove the ruling classes and the traditional political order is reflected in the sudden election"offs», or in the unexpected changes in collective sentiment in the last and most recent, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the Labour's downfall in the UK, to the rebellion of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, they have increasing problems to understand, that is to say, to represent, which, not from today, is being created in the deep sections of Western societies and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, growing, potentially wander too much.
Before this, it would be an exaggeration to talk about a permanent "mask revolt».
But we certainly can't say it means keeping your eyes open.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity with the super glue and in the future walking on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centres and has now come very close to it by a team of four institutes.
Scientists managed to keep the 100-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall with a sticker of just 2.5 square centimetres.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, the Akron, the Institute of Technology of Georgia and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is a development of materials that already in existence use a special carbon structure called carbon-like carbon pipes.
«We can imagine the base of glue as a series of pipes laid out as an arranged pile of spaghetti» explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Institute of Georgia of the Atlanta Institute of Technology.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the geckon, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to be perfectly attached.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, showed that the new glue is ten times the legs of these reptiles and at the same time"is simply to tap off the wall» explained by Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Education, the University of Engineering.
CHODIT'S WILL BE been made? -"This material could be useful as a makeshift glue» is supplied by Liming Dai.
Walking the walls like Spiderman, perhaps? Perhaps so, but researchers think of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical appliances, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and power.
Other applications could be about aerospace engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
OTHER RESEARCH – Also, the University of Berkley, California, is researching a new glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists introduced groove-formed micro-fibre adhesive as hair that is self-cleaning from dust to the surface to preserve the perfect fitting.
Medicine: Never with juices
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed primarily in summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some of your life-saving medicines, their ingestion is altered to boost or reduce the effectiveness with severe health consequences.
To highlight the risks of juices for both finished and fresh juices in the United Nations University in London, to highlight the risks of some of the drugs, the American Chemical Society's current 263rd National Meeting in Philadelphia is raising a new alarm: one glass of grape, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, to nullify their beneficial effects, and put patients at risk at the health of patients.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to the toxic level the effects of some anti-aritemic drugs, antibiotics, an anxiolite, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
MEDICES IN RISK – This was announced by the Italian Medical Agency itself in an information bulletin two years ago and roused doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink when they take medication, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ON GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that dampen the drugs.
A long list of effects subdued by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, a challenge by Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department at the State University of Milan: "Such discoveries are usually immediately announced to various international and national pharmacy agencies, which eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for drugs.
So read always the illustrative leeks of the medication you get and if you come across something unclear, don't be unsettled, but ask a doctor or pharmacist to clarify» stressed the expert for the Ansa agency.
The Nobel for Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies in commercial models and the localisation of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novonňan who teaches at the University of Priceton and who is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in the Bush administration's foreign, economic, and political actions.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, on the days when Enron crashed, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of implications for the history of the United States, far more important than the first.
A prediction that triggered a lot of controversy and that had been reproached for years, which proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which collapses such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public interest, Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great importance», but also a populariser who has a "very aggressive style, particularly critical of the Bush liberalist administration's excesses».
Open Office, we have here the third release of the package "anti-Microsoft»
It's the release day of Open Office.org 3.0, the open source personal production package, which is moving toward more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteer workers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various new releases: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will be added to the revised and improved opening window, far more essential, as compatibility for the operating system of the Apple Mac OS X and the support of the new ODF Format Format format, the last standard version of the ISO.
The emphasis is also on the cooperation with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft application (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronically transferring, or the ability to transfer the PDF folder to the graphical design model and maintain the original look of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble the typical Adobe graphic and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or a text program.
Collaboration is an element that has made many improvements within application programs: in Excelel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color to commentary to make clearer identification in the reviewing phase.
Some firms are also working to relay some of the Open Office features to the Web, and should reimaginate a definitive result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which is located on the mirrore from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent to home or to the workplace on request.
And if the topic of free of charge can be a draw to expanding in homes, it is on the Open Office business area that the package is a lot betting, and can already count on the various projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there are also offers of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet that goes to the Excel replacement; Impress for Presents similar to Powerpoint; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and considering that as of today we are almost at 3 million and 600,000, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this projected number can even be surpassed.
Kohl's results are also positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case in the last Tour de France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third-ranked and winner of the best top scorer's T-shirt.
The report was quoted as saying on the L'Equipe website.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver positive for Cero, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those made in recent weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analyses confirm the positivity at Cero, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will have to face a set two years of disqualification.
The report on the positivity of Kohl to the third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed the outcome of the Austrian government authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evansema, and also won the polka dot T-shirt of the best top scorer.
IMIGRANTI:NEW YORK TIMES WITH THE TRAIN, ITALY RASISTOU
Italy "as a country of emigrants, it has only been transformed into the priority objective of immigrants in the last house" with resistance.
Does this turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is how they are asked in a long article by the New York Times, which addressed this article to the debate on the subject of racism in Italy, and began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, killed in Milan last month because he stole a box of biscuits.
This case is made visible by what the New York Times defines the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are at the same time the ones where "more integration and more work" are registered, but also "the country's most powerful anti-immigrant mindset and the Northern League's strongest support."
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites instances of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
The new legislation required by Lega, which seeks to hinder immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
Tendency, highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, having met with Benedetto XVI in the Quirinale, asked that the state and the church work together to defeat racism."
Found plane of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane was found by Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying across the desert in Nevada.
The debris was discovered on one plateau at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Jade, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Madera County's sheriff, John Anderson, dispelled the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are sure that this is exactly what Steve Fossett flew in the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore clarified that the human remains were not found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (Ntsb) reported that hours after the wreckage was recognized, a screening team was dispatched to eventually identify the plane: it is exactly the Bellanc 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossetta's personal items were found in one pair close to their dwelling in Mammoth Lakes.
There are two documents with Fossett's name, both released by the Illinois Federal Air Administration, cash and one jacket.
Fossetta's search was discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of first place.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an air balloon: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he circled the world on the plane and without landing.
His many records also include a flight at an altitude of 15,445 metres, over the Andes, albeit with a copilot.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and well defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This, in a nutshell, is the last Glk born in the "compact" jeep of the star's house, by which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a whirlwind of news to this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional treatment that the unexpected and unconventional road will be made to accompany the launch of Suv Glk, which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17. October.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also launch an unofficial method of communication thanks to the futuristic 3D poster campaign, which is thus first used in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi posters project, divided into three different phases, will dominate Milan's main business avenue, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and using special glasses that will be distributed near the Corsa Como, the new Suv can be seen in almost real dimensions and in a three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you'll get the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, using the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be enlightened at different moments in all its minutiae to then re-fill into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he succeed in attracting the interest of future customers in this way? We'll see.
So now we know who the Italian hooligans are
Triveneto, risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following the Nazionale azzurra for years and which, in truth, has never caused excessive problems.
Nor has she ever met with fans of her opponent.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste e Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglie.
They have three-color flags on which the descent cities of the people involved appear: they were removed on Saturday night to avoid being recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all in the name, that is, easily controlled.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasel, no one who was forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had earlier offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and a game banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that come from the Bulgarian police, then take precautions: In this case, Daspo can be given for five years to at least fans who were arrested or identified during the riots.
The International Daspo, which forbids visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will not set foot on a single stadium.
To luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that means that more than a hundred and fifty will be added to the more.
"We must immediately extinguish this fire and not justify those who behave in this way," they confirm from Vimin.
So, "highly open eyes, mainly for the national match on Wednesday in Lekla."
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of backers.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can also count on one part of Aise, it is the secret service, which takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The Chorus Leader-Leader and the tense arm during the Mamel anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime...".
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way), who is the director of Viminál's Osservatorio for a few weeks (he got a job that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a Bursar in Trieste, where the core of the Ultras Italia backers, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to glorify the leader, but of course that the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is an embarrassment.
"I am not a sociologist - the Osservatorian number one adds - the crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far this group has remained within limits, now let's take a good look at what has happened and evaluate for the future.
However, let's also talk about whistling at the Mamel's anthem: it's not a crime either, but if you don't mind, it's rude...".
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The leashing market for university students is unfamined in a crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunius, the tenants' unions, a single room can be rented by a single room to a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"The je has already reached such proportions that entire classes of students have lost their right to study because of the overall high prices their families would have to endure - explains the head of the office for studies at Sunia, Laura Mariani - in this city the great demand from students distorted the market in such a way that it sparked the process of price increases that also swelled up for the residents."
In most cases, the rents offerings contain several offences: contracts in a free way, not registered, without a limited rent, associated lodgings.
For Sunji, there is an exceptional intervention that could regulate prices thanks to the revision of taxes.
If we look at the research details, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros per bed, for a single room it is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Barta Nerezerior) to the mean value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euro, one room costs about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones close to the university, it takes 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in single rooms.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 bed in a double room.
The values are a little lower (550 euros for single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will only save money if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for the single room of the Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, there is a bed of, like 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want a bed of 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have greater impacts on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where rents are for students from outside the European Union, one more anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about the 25%-30% of the fee they want from foreign students, compared to the Italian students.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, cities cancel the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favour of Multiplex.
"A city without cinema is blind, it's like a face without eyes."
The painting, offered by director Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in Italy's major city centres, as well as rural towns.
The process of curbing cinema, the birth of the great multisyal in the suburbs, and the subsequent demise of the monsoles in the central zones of cities, is one of events that appear to be inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the hallmarks of genuine cultural crime.
Often the historical places are disappearing packed with memories," it is as if we have lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a part of the road and a lot of emotion», is felt by the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won the Oscar and the Grand Jury award in Cannes 20 years ago, and who told the poetry of a village cinema and sadness for the way of life that the cinema probably lost forever.
The values obtained by the Ane, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, the doors of the traditional tip have closed the door, and the top account was paid for primarily by the halls in the most important cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Torín, 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected enclosures, Emilia-Romagna is in first place, with the loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex is the one that the three Italian regions, which have registered the highest number of new cinema media: 195 more screenings in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
«The Italian procedure has evolved unparatically» claims Paolo Protti, President Anecu,"it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the already existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to relocate to the multiplex.
Then let's not talk about the lack of fund subsidy for the benefit of the operators: the previous national debt is about 10 million euros.
In moral and ethical terms, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Support for the sector would require between 16 and 18 million euros a year».
What is interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and which has decided to find a way out by signing a protocula between the village and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the standards planned are the steps of tax breaks in favour of the operators and the benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the zone with limited traffic and have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
«This initiative I like» is called by Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
Defending a traditional cinema is a theme that was important forever: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to set up the "New Cinema Paradiso" that I've been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinlo in Nazional Street, where I shared so much emotion that I did not have to look at the inscriptions of blackened dust, I will turn the other way».
Links between politics and the mafia group 'sleghetto, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in Prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the city's office's election according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The accusations against the Mafia in Calabria against the mayor and vice-hape of Gioi Taori Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarne, Carlol Martello, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are tough.
Also in the irons, Gioacchino Piromalli, an old intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson's lawyer, the namesake of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"Ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as common sense," the prosecutors write as two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for consultations to the lawyer, Piromalli.
"So they would have allowed the mafia group, the judges, to officially enter the city authorities, facilitating the already enormous possibilities of public administration control and management."
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide the fact that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal underworld are a lot in his county: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where collusion is inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'c-car, the heroes who are still untainted'.
The junctions of this morning follow the imprisonment of July last year, with which police showed that the mafia group Piromalli had been hit by the final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been disbanded since 1991, the reason for the then-protected link between organized crime and local administration - local politicians have been stripped of their positions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democrat leader who, at the moment of dissolution, was elected head of the right-of-center coalition after the narrower election in May.
He was screaming about the scandal when Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called to accountable then-Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti and accused him of plotting everything for political reasons, but the judges in the imprisonment ordinance signed this morning explain that the mafia group even came to such a distance as to request a change to the A3 motorway project.
Other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors write, came to light "willingness to move the businessman's claims, the representatives of a larger group very close to him, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the mafia group.".
When the energy is born of the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now beginning to be discovered by the world's great energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, the tide are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of colossus such as Chevron, which is now trying to reach out to these sources, are hitting their hands.
The ability to generate energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a century, and in the 1970s, in the context of the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell by the time the price of oil fell, the idea of using marine energy went by the wayside. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the price of oil have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) said in London in 2007 that around 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea wave movement.
that amount would be twice the energy currently produced in the nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and tides and tides.
The giants attack.
the company that bet on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary move.
After two years of betting on marine energy, it is increasingly a society that bets on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"The Chaever is studying ocean energy technology, a spokesman for a company that is linked to the United States' oil colossus, the Wall Street Journal, the economic daily newspaper – and is thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering is about obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is required to launch a project to use marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US is further mining of oil, and President Bush recently came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc follows the trail of marine energy. From New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, show increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology, kerou needs to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology that is still in its early stages because it is not known what the impact of the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, the facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to be causing major problems for the ecosystem.
But for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the forward.
The methods are varied: Ocean Power, for example, uses the system's fears that are linked to each other.
The strength of the waves, which moves up and down with the buoys, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders for the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies the energy to the generator.
The energy is coming ashore by underwater cables.
For now, four of these types are in the project phase, waiting only for federal approval, and part of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing power for the mall and parking by using six pdmarine turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of the water during the tide is caused by the rotation of the turbines, which feed the generator in this rotating motion.
Verdant has commented that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations for the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the low tide.
Particularly interested in the potential for tides at this point, they say at the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although this is a disjointed factor, the tide and the tide are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It was in the energy of the tide and outflow that states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, and other coastal states, had already invested $7 and a half in the mile-onner in 2008, predicting investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
