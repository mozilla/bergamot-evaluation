Prague Stock Exchange plummeting to the bottom at the end of trading
After a sharp slump in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions with CEZ shares amounted to almost half of the daily daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange followed up its slump on Monday's start to trading on Tuesday, falling by nearly six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the Wall Street stock slump.
Here, too, the market's response to the outcome of the U.S. House of Representatives vote is emerging, which refused to support a plan to stabilize the financial sector there.
Share fall in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday was seen by shares on the stock exchanges in Asia, although the indices eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong stock exchange was off nearly four percent in the course of trading, but later erased some of its losses and the decline reduced to around 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the Chinese stock market's move to Hong Kong, fell 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange were down more than five percent, but ultimately fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock exchange fell 3.6 percent, according to the country's index.
"The timing of the rescue operation in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," noted Hong Kong's head of the MMF, Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines monetary policy on its own, without reliance on China's central bank.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US lawmakers should return to negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, he said, there is a risk that other countries will feel the effects.
Blood baths of American shares
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to be spent up to $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion).
Lawmakers ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
US stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, with major stock indexes marking the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by nearly seven percent, and it fell to a similar scale as recently as 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but once it became clear that the bill had failed in the House, the index found itself in a free fall.
Congress backs down: US government may pump $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial assistance agreement for the US financial system.
It will be voted on earlier next week.
US lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion).
However, it is not yet won.
Indeed, congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final form of the law.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
The Senate said the plan could probably be put to a vote on the plan as early as Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be approved should be the first major psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, thereafter, it will be "cut-up" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms to help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We have solved our differences of opinion on what the package's shape to stabilise the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be reached later on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson overnight on Sunday to give the final shape to the government fund.
This should buy back from financial corporations' unsold mortgage assets that pull financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement of the plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is hitting stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the non-Nadhani Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement in Congress later on Sunday.
Indeed, they want to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone, where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trading.
But it is not yet clear with certainty when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the bill, nor whether they cannot get stuck on a last-minute issue.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo a number of changes.
The total amount to be addressed to assist the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
But Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it is under the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, in a run of an additional $100 billion and later a final $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress in negotiations
While the president may veto this decision, Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to get finance to buy back bad mortgage securities, the value of which has plummeted because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, have been preserved.
"We've worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
US President Bush is also satisfied with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was satisfied with Saturday's progress and appreciating "the blather-award effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restrictions on golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the head of the negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed to a liability for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing concessions, timing the financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for the directors participating in the program and set up a committee to supervise the fund.
This should be run by the Treasury.
"We have worked very hard at this and have made great progress towards a deal that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also envisages help for homeowners who have trouble repaying.
The government should negotiate new repayments for the mortgages it will buy in order to reduce the monthly cost of repayments for borrowers and allow them to keep their houses.
Marek: Psychological help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to David Mark, the chief economist at Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because it is not known by what mechanism and price the problem assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government will split the losses between them," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the start of next week is not that important, according to Mark.
"More importantly, the Congo-Russians agree this week ago that they are supporting the plan and that they will sanction it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on the fact that approval will take place is the most important thing at the moment," Marek stressed.
The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together have 29 percent
The appreciable weakening of the two sides of the previous grand coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties were brought about by the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly strong losses, with the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, shaking gravely.
Conversely, the election leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthian Governor Jörg Haider is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, the country's Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the latest 2006 elections.
Worse still, the ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in Austria's post-war history and, especially for the Peoples, who provoked early elections, a literally disastrous result.
As recently as early July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the Peoples were well ahead of the SPÖ in their preferences.
But voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the party chairman and incumbent vice-chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer, was heard.
Observers believe this could happen as early as Monday at a special meeting of the party's bureau.
Such a development would probably facilitate the path to the still most likely way out of the election result, the renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and the ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Freedom Party (FPÖ) provisionally won 18 per cent and the BZÖ eleven per cent of the vote - the Social Democrats also voiced concerns about the repetition of the year 1999, when the People's Party agreed with populists (then the FPÖ was united, it was split from the BZÖ) in a joint government, which even triggered sanctions from the European Union.
Haider is clearly betting on this development, having already said he was ready to work with any party and envisions a return to Vienna for national politics.
The Green Party was still in parliament, but it lost slightly and fell between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
Apparently, none of the other parties had overtaken the 4% threshold and did not make it to parliament.
Clash on a knife-edge: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make the phone call.
This makes it clear that it is better to buy just a phone.
Still, there are enough reasons to get a stand-alone player.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the prospects of the future owner.
It's probably hard to get a top-of-the-line, expensive record player to listen to the latest album Maxim Turbulenc.
For one thing, such music products do not work on LP boards, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if the vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues are being stressed on your shelves, you are probably at least dreaming of such a gramophone.
It is the same with the music on the road, i.e. the music compressed, in simple terms - by the music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just as a Pink Floyd fan is unlikely to bite the headphones for 20 crowns from the market.
Two extremes, with enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
It also determines battery life
Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than just playing music, but what most mobile phones can't do.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Alongside the primary features, phone calls and texting, he can play music and video, record both, have the better one, the worse camera and maybe he can even navigate.
And taking into account smartphones and commuters, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a minor miracle, no refrigerator can't barbecue, and no TV is photographing.
The versatility of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap mobiles, therefore, expect them not to play for more than a few hours.
If you call for it here and there again, get one more charger for work - that's also true for more expensive devices.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even the worse ones last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted single-charge operation.
Another problem occurs when recording music to a mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, and not every one of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be uploaded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards used on their phones without reduction.
For players, with exceptions (iPod), you do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobiles and players already create a music library by themselves, ranked by the name of the artist, album title, genre or, for example, user reviews.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories in the same way as the Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with the operating system).
Players are easier to operate, mobile phones are more good
When choosing a particular device, be particularly interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and audio output type, as well as, of course, the comfort of the control.
If the music is primarily a backdrop to you and if you listen to it every day just briefly on the tram, you only need any mobile phone that plays MP3.
Which is really almost a mobile phone can already do.
You don't even have to watch much of what music formats a mobile or player can do.
MP3 can handle them all, and the vast majority of the music that reaches you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widely used and, in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also master music in the WMA format.
Less occurs AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit the relevant operator's website (or other provider) via the mobile internet and purchase a song or album.
This service could already be a strong argument for acquiring a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is poor and is mostly limited to fast-paced radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that it is this way of selling music (whether through GSM, the internet or wireless internet) that this is the way of selling music to the music industry in the future.
Mobile is worn by most people at their place.
Whenever you want to hear something, you feel the mobile phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you also always carry headphones or at least wired hands-free.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobile will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones normally cost under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns, you can already get a very decent walkman.
However, you will usually be limited by the absence of output to regular headphones.
The best and, technically, the most equipped phones with a 3.5 mm slot for regular headphones are up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of players, among other things, is easy to operate.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be controlled by really everyone.
The minimal functionality, the similarity of the controls with the previously common cassette player or perhaps the gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collisions in the form of an accidentally switched-on mobile internet and then a giant account for data transmission.
What machine to reach for
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually has a slot on interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the appropriate card, you can fit into two thousand crowns.
But beware.
Only 2 GB of maximum capacity is supported for basic models.
Only the most expensive can handle 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativa, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
By capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than CZK 1,100.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, should you rather reach for specialized mobiles - walkmen (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for the MP3 and the comfort of the operator is thus close to a standalone MP3 player.
The furthest is in the Sony Ericsson field, whose walkman-series have the same user interface as the self-sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to CZK 4,000, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will be taken by MP3 players from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Yet we are missing something here - a virtual operator to make the classic ones cheaper.
He may not be absent for long.
We have written about the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe in Europe many times.
Indeed, this was confirmed by ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
Following the European Commission's latest actions in the field of regulating roaming charges, this may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to go into battle.
It may sound paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetration to over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain about the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, who has commented several times in the past, is often chimed in for them that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It's probably true that a classic operator with its own network doesn't seem to have much of a chance anymore (it would be hard to find frequencies for that matter anymore).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought about a significant price reduction, to which classical operators then had to respond.
At the same time, before the entry of the pike like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar voices in the UK as in the UK.
But it turns out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we don't have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, the operator has managed to recruit more than 100,000 customers and become the country's fifth largest operator.
At the same time, the financial group Penta, which owns U:fona among others, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they only need far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not entail relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators tend to profile themselves as low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a narrower service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as much cheaper as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobileiding in Poland shows, a bet on a novel target group can also be a pretty good move.
This operator specifically targets men.
"Chaired guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept could be caught up in our country.
Vodafone's press spokesperson Miroslav Čepický doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segmental approach on which most virtual operators are founded.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopeful.
Rather, the Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studničková, press spokesperson for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It implicitly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are certainly not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hidden by the GTS Novera group for a long time, which would thus like to take the next step towards becoming a real competitor to Telefónica O2 in the corporate customer field.
"We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to move forward with some of them in the negotiations," says the group's press spokesperson, Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe there's a glimmer of better days.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should be looking forward to perhaps by the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room for a fully-fledged virtual operator to be created on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2 said in his comments to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also being invoked by other operators.
T-Mobil's press spokesperson Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with O2's comments: "So far we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to be further built."
He adds: "It is difficult for a virtual operator to appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
At this point, we'd have to have a concrete agreement on the table to be considered in this short term."
Vodafone is more likely to be drawn to meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický says: "By dealing with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of burden and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial in terms of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and thus a decline in their profits.
So why facilitate the emergence of such a competitor?
The fact that operators are at a point that they can pull together when an operator is involved, is also evidenced by the tussle over the creation of U:fona.
Perhaps the most pressure towards ČTÚ came at the time of the creation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the ČTÚ website.
But now it is U:fon who is useful as an argument for not allowing a virtual operator to.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive mobile market environment was recently amplified by the entry of a fourth mobile operator to the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player would make high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
However, given this approach by mobile operators, the sheer disinterest of the Czech regulators is astonishing.
This is not just about the ČTÚ's position, which unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in competition in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
But he took his signature stance on the whole issue.
"A virtual operator's entry into the mobile market would be possible after a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator to lease the necessary infrastructure would be concluded.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential bidders was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations Department of the Office of the Office said in response to our inquiry.
The comments thus formulated will not be surprised by the representatives of the operators.
It is more from the Office, which is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses their position in the market, is more than a precarious one.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the country, where virtual operators normally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
But apparently the pressure on the fair functioning of the market environment and the decline in prices are not among the interests of the OBR.
In fact, the shocking thing about the case is the touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is entirely self-evident.
Like the exact same price of petrol at petrol stations, it is surely just a matter of chance and a fierce competition.
"The Office did not find signs of anti-competitive conduct in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, so it has a corresponding increased responsibility for its market conduct.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are most likely missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his comments.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets prepared by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different perspective - the consent of the network operator is always required to create a virtual operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically, has a monopoly on its network.
So in a particular segment, it necessarily has to be dominant.
But even if we did not allow this argument, it should be at least a warning to the OBR that the three mobile operators are doing strikingly similarly.
At the same time, complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The upload of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a rather common ploy in telecommunications, with which the OBR hands off the whole affair.
We've met him on several occasions like this.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of ČTÚ's powers to competition in telecommunications failed to enforce, although a number of experts promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the OHS must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
It's going to work when no one's looking
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-optional operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies issuing their own price lists for mobile telephony services, but they are only partially public.
They are usually companies engaged in multilevel marketing.
The likes of Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only the elect.
The magic is that the company acts as a classic corporate customer to the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, they will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar reselling.
"If there were cases of which you are referring to, it could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrová said in response to our question on the problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such activity will not be brought to the responsible people from mobile operators.
In the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is opposing such a procedure.
Indeed, they make not inconsiderable profits from the activities of these firms, and yet - unlike the actual virtual operators - do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out to possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are used by only a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not in their name, so they cannot dispose of it fully as ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is what should be at least strange to ČTÚ.
In addition, another question is being raised for the OBR.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the OBR has relatively strong powers to expose such an activity, and if it does not want to, it may not be content to explain to the operators that they have no idea about this and their terms of trade prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As the text has already fallen on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable decline in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were created, the classic operators sought to hinder their creation more or less.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - too small, or, or, if too, a saturated market, service quality problems, etc.
But in developed countries, it was at these moments that regulators intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but in their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator and another one was packed into it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are tossing the case around like a hot potato.
We cannot escape the impression from our experience that ambiguity in competencies is more than suited to them in these cases.
But let's not throw a gun in the toe.
If behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator will really appear in our country soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the OBR to remain indifferent to the denial of (discrimination) of other bidders.
And we might stop calling for more than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four performances of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of Czech Statehood's Day solemnly unveiled new recordings of the national anthem Where My Home.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, choral form and instrumental wording.
The singing was taken in by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem are editing with Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful anthems.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen to sing solo variants for singing the singers with young representative voices, which are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them, and then, with the choir, that they had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they were judged," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where My Home was first performed on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by music by František Škroup.
She gained popularity and people spontaneously embraced it.
The first verse of the song, after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became a natural part of the national anthem.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem is
Prague's public transport will also take a lift to the chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1. October 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers will take boarding on the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased at this point by roughly 100,000 people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will apply from 1 January 2009 and have to be uploaded to their chip card in the information centre and workplaces of the Transport Company in metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be bought over the internet on the Transport Company's website www.dpp.cz from yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers by the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the outlet windows at the subway stations, where they still have to stand regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon over the internet and upload it to their Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these locations, passengers have a desk with trained service to help those interested with internet purchases and also uploaded a coupon purchased to their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard in self-service machines, which are mounted in several metro vestibules.
What do machines like like that look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket markers and passengers may have noticed them in the Roztyly metro stations, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five of them in the city, but there should be eighty by the end of the year," Cautious said.
The coupon checks the driver's seat
The operation of the vending machines that will start operating tomorrow is simple.
Just slide the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it by itself.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, on suburban trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which are mainly used to the capital by residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"On the trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the conductors are equipped with card readers to determine the time and band validity of coupons," explained ticket check Filip Drápal from the organization Ropid, which sets up the timetables of Prague's public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's ticket office.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also the option is to attach the Opencard to the designated place at the side of the cash register.
This will check the validity of the uploaded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not take suburban buses and will not remember when their coupon is coming to the start of their coupons again to the self-service machines where the coupons are recorded on the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents is displayed on the device's screen.
Sudetenland wanted a referendum after the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the inclusion of Sumava to the United States.
It comes from a letter deposited in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans were reportedly turning to the president of the United States in 1945.
This is the result, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter from the US president not to allow the return of the "Sumava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure of the words that the American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed in the words "People who care about the fate of the Sumatra."
Because joining Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans - knowledge of the Czech national character - hope only of brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter to the US president begging to take over the Protectorate for the present and eternity.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a state to us a foreign one, who oppresses and refutes minorities and nothing, has contributed nothing to the Allies' victory," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of the vindictiveness of the "Czech oppressors."
If the US President allegedly doubted the mindset of the Sumava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the Sumava county about whether its people wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses, it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that this would be about their expulsion from the republic, few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the UK to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was a Hamishan German during the war deployed to the Baltic.
When he was taken in by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, they would need Czech," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war, according to him, counted on being relegated from the republic by the Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional campaign to attack drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, one could characterize the emotional media campaign that the Department of Transportation intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises from her that he will discourage drivers from behaving at the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, the cinema, on the internet, but also on the flyers.
It should deter the driver from driving fast and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also reminded them to strap in before they leave.
He wants to reach into conscience especially for young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what will appear in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" campaign's slogan:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "do you don't mean" is written in capital letters on the license plateau.
And then in a pool of blood, the word "pay."
This is to symbolize that one can pay with one's own life in a moment's inattention.
The audience will be "scared" by the spots until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where pictures with drastic images of accident victims can normally be seen.
It promises to reduce the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG.
Sugar and a whip on the driver
"The driver's carrot and stick system applies.
The sugar for them is that when they go for a red light, for example, they save time.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why information campaigns are needed in the press and, above all, negative ads, the psychologist says.
Already less effective, he says, are the boards that alert drivers to the danger.
"If a static board is installed warning of danger, it will probably soon merge with the surroundings and the drivers will not attend to it," Kořán pointed out.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, spoke in favour of returning virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the Jediot Achronot newspaper on Monday.
"We must come to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all of them," Olmert told the daily.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (the territory of Israel) because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want tractors or bulldozes to run over his legs, as it did to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, referring to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the premiere, it will be necessary to find "special solutions for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places" that lie within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work," he stressed further.
Leaving the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's departure from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving the Golan," he cautioned.
"The Syrians know what they'll have to give up to win over to the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with the (Silesian Movement) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the lasting support provided by the terrorism (of the Shabi movement) of Hamas, (terrorist networks) of Al-Qaeda and the jihad of the (holy war) in Iraq," the prime minister clarified.
Schwarzenberg: India's relations may cool down
If the problem with Czech scientists who have been indicted in India for illegally collecting beetles could not be solved, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The minister made the comments in New York after meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranáb Mukherdji, today.
"If this had not been resolved, then yes, then there would have been some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherji said after the hearing that the executive could be too difficult to interfere in the court matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government in Darjžiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls under.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Kucera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best for Mukherji to appeal to a higher instance.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the sentence to be free, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same statement in the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardonge him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way for a Czech party to enter the matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicts, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance was already provided to them by the Indian side.
"We have the highest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
Indians also recognise this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told the Czech Press Agency, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake of the imprisonment and indictment of these Czech scientists," he said.
Answers to the question of whether he had received a promise to deal with things from the Indian party was avoided.
"I've had quite a few promises," he said only.
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers could move on the bus while driving.
"If we would like to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activities of the steward is in violation of the Road Traffic Act," says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which was killed by a 22-year-old stewardess last week, was apparently caused by the driver of the lorry who crossed the bus's path.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver at that point, in the least safe place in the car, though she has two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake hard, even as the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with standing room, according to the technical licence.
If the bus is not homologated, the passenger must sit.
The Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing seats; which Aktuálně.cz was confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jančura.
"This is what the Ministry and I have dealt with and at first did not allow the movement of passengers.
They then called it off and came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while they are on the toilet if they have their seat," he said.
The law is not known to the steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legislation does not even prohibit the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the conductor of the vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds the spokesperson Hanzelka less unequivocally.
On the contrary, the director of the Road Vehicle Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the issue is adequately treated by the law.
"It depends on whether the bus is allowed in the homologation of standing rooms.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where standing spots and limited maximum speeds are limited, intercity with standing seats with higher-ranking speeds and in remote without standing at the top speed limit and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like a plane, says expert
BESIP's transport safety expert Jaroslav Hořín, on the move of the stewards on board the bus, does not see a major problem.
"There is not much danger in the smooth ride, the situation can be compared to the service on planes.
Even here, it's not certain when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant can hit his head."
"However, should the bus brake sharply, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on the city bus or the tram.
The safety of the stewards must be addressed by the carrier by internal regulations," he says, also saying that from the law the issue is unresolved.
Jančura is willing to cancel the services
Student Agency offers stewards services as the sole bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The director does not consider their profession to be at risk either after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the steward's profession is risky, I'll cancel them.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to passengers at the entrance.
It would also save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the lack of stewards in his cars was justified by the director of Asians, Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to the SA.
"We don't have stewards, we've been up against that from the start.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident," he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There was a immense tragedy
The accident of a regular service to Naples was killed by a young stewardess from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck probably swerved without using a rudder from the breakdown lane and blocked the bus's path.
His driver tried to avoid the maneuver with a violent manoeuvre, but he struck the right front.
That two places reserved for the stewards' rest would be sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These seats cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck's driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's sentence, but he also expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Adjustment of the law?
Not in sight
Clarifying the movement of the stewards on board the bus could be brought about by amending the law, which has been worked on by the Ministry of Transport's 30-member expert group for over a year.
"There was no concrete conclusion, of course.
Buses don't even deal with it too much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Transport Ministry does not consider the activities of the stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes Hanzelka, noting that the control of bus safety is under the jurisdiction of the police and labour safety authorities.
Czech judges fight for seabed
It will approach the wall map of the wall map, which shows Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
He is not interested in the continent, however, but by a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as big as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team of staff at the United Nations Division on Oceans and Law Affairs.
His boss, the division's director, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally completes.
There is labor drive and enthusiasm.
The seabed is hid by a world hitherto little known, rich in natural resources.
There is a search for oil, ore and other minerals, but also still-unknown living organisms that carry the key to, say, developing a cancer drug.
A bottom greater than land
Coastal states today began to bid in vigorously for new undersea territories.
According to the UN Convention, they are exercising their rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to several hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
It is under the Convention entitled to all the resources of the continental shelf.
"In simple terms, behind the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its bedrock, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the two-hundred-homania limit of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the continental shelf must be accompanied by comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a number of years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide legal and technical assistance to the commission.
The Commission has so far discussed five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the latter countries have succeeded so far," Mikulka adds.
The world response was recently observed in Australia's success, which was the first to substantially expand its undersea holdings.
But he also won New Zealand - the seabed area the board admitted to him last week is about 1.6 million square miles, roughly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profit that will flow to them from the seabed's use of the seabed in the future will be, as they sorely so.
Other states will submit their applications in turn.
They can do so until they did ten years from the time they ratified the "Stego Bay's Smooth.
Where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor region begins, a convention declared "common heritage of mankind."
Here, no state has an exclusive status.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by the Convention by an international institution established.
"But the sea floor is no Klondajk," director Mikulka says on the pitch, noting that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime contractually enshrined."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are sharing them with other states of the former Eastern Bloc as part of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal."
It received the status of a so-called "pioneer investor" under the convention, as well as the investors of a few other states, under the convention.
It is authorized to mine in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The investor-distinguished area is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is rugged there, it's a kind of underwater replica of the Tatras.
"There, to be mined over an area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic concreties containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings to the demonstration one such concrection.
It resembles a small potato or, with a little imagination, the fabled shem that, according to legend, revived the Golem.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
Big words in the WestLB board's letter to the employees of this bank are not lacking.
By combining the units of this Düsseldorf money institution with Frankfurt's Deka-Bank, "the central institution of the financial group of savings banks for the capital market trade" will be created," we will read in a letter that became public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will bring in a "series of competencies" providing long-term returns.
And, in the first place, such a merger can be a decisive impetus for further association in the provincial bank sector.
Such texts are made when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the North Rhine-Westphalia Regional Government that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
Nevertheless, the connection between Deka-Bank, which the savings bank customers know for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever its kind, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
The head of Deka-Bank, Franz Waas, said at the presentation of his six-month-old results at the end of August that he did not see the point of fusing his bank house from Mainzer Landstraße with any of the country's banks, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of Deka-Bank, backed by one half of the Landesbank and from the other by the savings banks, has commissioned the board of directors to conduct interviews with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be business in the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, the financiers point out.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the more important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, has not been discussed for the first time in the savings sector's consolidation.
In 2003, it looked as if there might be a merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and with Helaba.
This tri-spolk thing was nothing after all.
Shortly after the merger's plans became public, the Hessen Provincial Government spoke out against the participation of Helaba Bank.
The two remaining banking houses did not come together either.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was instead acquired by the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg of Stuttgart.
Despite this, there has been repeated speculation about the merger of Deka-Bank with the Landesbanks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, the chairman of Helaba Bank's board of directors, was negative about the news of the merger of his financial home with others.
However, it seems to be in the clear of the belief that the convergence of the various banking houses of the public-sector sector is a must.
Now, after the elections to the provincial assembly in Bavaria, BayernLB's merger with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could begin to emerge.
That's not good news for Helaba.
Should the pressure for further mergers increase, it is gradually losing potential partners for such a merger.
In the south, it would play only the second fiddle despite the fact that it has faced the financial crisis significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
Connections with WestLB were banned earlier in the year by the Hessen-Thüring Banks' Association, which has an eighth-fifth cent share in Helaba.
This would be the only way to consider Nord LB.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one party to the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of the individual institutions are tuning in together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive issue of the business model should be secured by the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks, the German Association of Savings Banks and Siro banks had not yet been answered.
Everything could also end with the layout of the WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
That is why the local board of directors' letter is also talking about trying to make a "complex solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to combine with the connection of the individual components with Deka-Bank will tell time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with the Italians"
This is the first time for Elena, for the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so he says things will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre Kaiser barrel, there is a stronger bearded man and two hundred tourists on Oktoberfest demonstrate how deep tones he can give his throat.
Elena Luca slap first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova Station, there will be four buses at 23.45 marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra" by the expected arrival of 6.30am.
The three buses are mainly occupied by Italians, with only Brazilians riding on one bus.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, having already celebrated at night.
And out loud, says Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
Marc, wearing a long coat with a fume imitation lining and glasses with wide silver rims, the three buses belong.
He has been riding with them for five years on the Oktoberfest, hosting three expeditions this year alone.
At night there, during the day between the beer stalls, at 10:30 p.m. left back.
Overnight would mean only unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including a welcome toast to the Kaiser, brewed exactly under the Bavarian Purity of Beer, Health Insurance and German-speaking Guide - Marco went to a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses go out into the night, on the autostrada in the direction of "Brennero."
Beer is not served, not yet.
The bus quickly silences, passengers sleep.
They do well, they'll need their strength.
Built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where a few other buses with Italian license plates are taking one more break on Highway 8 just before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrives at a parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 a.m. on schedule, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are being collected, Marco has her last speech, explains the plan of the attack.
One: Put on a yellow cap.
On it, it says "Oktoberberfest" on the left, next to the internet address of Marc's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Two: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" Marco calls into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so that you don't get in the way, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, place around the space!"
The maz cost 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Let's show the DAYs that we behave.
Once you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Three: "Tonight at 10:30 p.m. be here again!" Understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
Along the way, one member of the group hangs on yellow caps as tree markers, signs and even an election poster of a large Bavarian party.
You need to prepare to retreat.
As a "weekend with Italians" he is known for the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Accurate figures for the number of visitors are not available; they are talking about the fifty thousand of those who set off on their way through the Alps and fall into the beer tents, ten per cent of all visitors are said to have arrived from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police ranks will be reinforced by seven police officers from the South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads national statistics in which Italians take the first place in front of the British (about 60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments.
The Hofbräu tent is particularly popular with the Italians.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
As recently as last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
Good thing the politician used the word "relatively" and the fact that the German banking sector would not be spared the crisis development in its claim.
For this one came up the previous weekend.
With the Dax index, the under-priced financial house specializing in the financing of the Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive a loan from a consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit assistance in question would go up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will only have to pay the interest on the amount actually drawn.
The money is said to come from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
The state's financial officer, according to a newspaper report, has been extremely briefly refinanced for long-term projects for which he lent money, which is no longer possible now because of mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve booed by 95% to €2.37 million, and the equity share of equity slightly down from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial business fell to zero compared to last year, revenues from the increased value of receivables and certain securities, as well as the cancellation of reserves for credit trading, fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher refunds for subsequent settlement costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the interest reimbursement under the Tax Code and for brokering trade for the Concre Group were the 16% decrease still moderate on the revenue side.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state-owned financier was burned on mortgages for sole traders, which were then set aside from the portfolio of services and further led by Aareal Bank.
Because there was too little profit in classic state funding, Depfa was then more heavily involved in infrastructure projects and to finance joint projects by private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate must now write something off the value of its subsidiary, and these depreciation will have a "cost material effect" on the calculation of the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have been vaguely heard.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
It was already cut back by two-thirds for 2007.
Since taking over of the Decope, Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier for state and infrastructure projects.
More strongly than other institutes, it depends on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, a spring of interbank loans virtually dried up two weeks ago as banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding for part of the Depfa loan portfolio - around 50 billion euros - short-term funding.
According to the Hypo Real Estate, the financial need of the group is covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected "behind the influence of international money markets currently largely incompetent functions."
Other sources have been told that this money has secured refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use the money markets anytime soon.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) foresee that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate group on the market is now assured.
That is what the bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But given the dynamism and elusiveness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely impossible that the loan would not need to be fully exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank was apparently facing insolvency late on Sunday in the afternoon, the rescue cannot, if a preliminary, be calmed down by the passion.
The share price plummeted 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond rates were well held.
While preferential debt has barely moved, secondary bonds rates are being lost more significantly.
This applies in particular to the bonds of the former subsidiary company Württemberg Hypo and logically the bonds with the due date after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Est ties originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability, after a significant heightening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it to the company by taking over the Def, must be understood as a result of the stability of the international financial system.
As long as emission banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are willing to support the scheme, it is possible to count on the reimbursement of securities within their maturity period.
But it may also happen that almost no one dares to hope for at the moment - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalization of the probability bordering on certainty, it has now become mere legitimate hope.
This will probably set up a series of sleepless nights to their long-term creditors in particular, when they will decide whether to relinquish their commitments.
Short-cut investors can use the marginal line at least to create a loss transfer from previous accounting periods to later-year exchange rate yields for the purpose of the future payment of capital gains tax.
German special deployment units were in the freeing of hostages
The Egyptian government asked for help from Germany in dealing with the hostage crisis - the experts arrived.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were ready, but there was no deployment.
More details of the circumstances of the liberation of the eleven in Egypt of the kidnapped European tourists are gradually becoming public.
According to data from the ministries of defence and interior, the rescue was indirectly involved in the rescue effort by the German special forces.
According to the ministries, both Federal Army experts and the German police counter-terrorism group, the GSG9 counter-terrorism group, the Federal Police Squadron, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Services (Technisches Hilfswerk) were on the scene.
However, according to another statement from the spokesmen of both ministries on Monday afternoon, however, there was no need for German forces, as the kidnappers let their prisoners go and flee when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government is said to have accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that didn't happen," said one of the spokespersons of the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, as well as eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in the south of Egypt.
After being kidnapped in a desert region in the south of Egypt, they moved hostages in the border territories between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unclear to the last moment, as well as the details of the acquittal or possible payment of the ransom.
At the moment, the rescued are all right in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages was in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of his dismissal.
There is not yet any information available in Berlin for when the rescued will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, all five tourists should, even with special forces, leave by one of the Airbus of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secret of the box bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is to present herself on her first day at a high school in Tachibana, the girls start to be chuckled: the German woman is a total "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word from the mang. On his new exchange blog, he talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already scared from my trip to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train to the high school in Tachibana for 40 minutes.
I had to find the trip myself, luckily I didn't get lost.
It seems that the start of teaching on Tachibana is not given as strictly as it is at our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine, a short sit-down with the teacher, the so-called 'home room', begins.
But before the classroom started, I was supposed to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone 40 students in front of the class.
Not yet in my school uniform, I wore an old skirt of my host's mom, plus a blouse, blue knee socks, and black leather shoes.
So dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to say it all correctly: 'Sajónara Wo She Sely Sylvana' -' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and it's my birthday in a week's time.
At that point, I was very happy to start learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, giggling and waving, and I could still hear the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my mangles.
It is part of the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls' survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my seat.
The girl next to me smiled broadly enough, considered it an honor that a foreign student should have been sitting next to her.
The rest of the class was relatively calm, but when the gong came in, it literally filled me in.
They spoke in one's length and giggled and asked me about the possible and the impossible - yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, they all unpacked their bento.
My host mum made me a lunchbox, too - and that's different from boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber and eyelashe lettuce, fruit and a kind of fish in the tofu batter.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly am I eating here in Japan.
The things look strange and taste quite new.
What's certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, br!
Benta at Japanese schools is not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a handmade bento, which in this case is particularly artistically groomed, and hopes to get to know the boy closer to a snack during a break.
I read about that in my mango comics.
I wonder if I'll see this place, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Cause she just fascinates me."
After all, I like to read mangoes for years.
And to get better understanding of these comic books and their culture, I started learning a little Japanese once.
So I knew I'd have to come here one day.
Because I also have a thing for tradition, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is the countries of the latest technologies and trends, on the other it is rigorous, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here before, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen.'
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the US Congress let a $700 billion bailout package for financial markets fall by a narrow majority.
The Dow Jones fell sharply.
By a margin of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial market bailout package.
Despite all the calls from US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both sides have not found a majority for a program that is supposed to ease the chaos in financial markets.
The dramatic action was desperately sought to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called on the MP to give his consent before the vote, although, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
"It's hard to get political appreciation for avoiding something that hasn't happened in the first place," he acknowledged.
Earlier in the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
This was due to investors' concerns that the state rescue package could be forfeited.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose to fall steeply after the announcement of the package's shipwreck.
Experts are now counting on more serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is needed.
Even rats have feelings
When a rat or a cockroach runs from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals also have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify whether they feel the same thing when they behave in the same way as we do?
The online magazine "Edge" has been published for several years by posts by well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you consider true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, once we start to pursue another kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter the unseasonable terrain because the hardware does not coincide.
When a rat gets into danger, he will do the same as many other animals: he will pretend to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
Humans behave in the same way, from which some scientists conclude on comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that, however.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to devolve our subjective experience to experience animals.
This is both because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the side prefrontal cortex (because of its share in short-term memories and executing or management functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than other primates, and other creatures seem to be completely absent.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and make decisions, there is reason to believe that one is even distinguished from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be concealed by the language nature of man: because so much of his perception is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness didn't matter, the language would surely have affected it, so that the animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably be distinguished from most of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what the consciousness of other animals may look like.
When, as something indoor and subjective, you can neither measure nor, for the sake of special hardware, to analyse on the basis of our own experience, the exploration of it sets us up to major problems.
Most of my outlets relate to the content of conscious experience, but in addition there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to examine the processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in the short-term memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualisation.
But this approach, addressed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on the neural correlates of consciousness than causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but perhaps they are not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of a non-flare chutex for the realisation of visualisation.
What does this imply for feelings?
I infer them from the fact that an emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defensive system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) uses the memory.
Viewed from this angle, the feelings are closely intertwined with those cortex areas that characterize primates, and especially humans.
In connection with linguistic nature, a subtle graduation of perception arises, because by means of words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize states in order to credit them to others alongside themselves.
By contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brain stem areas of bodily feelings, like Yaak Pankseep, which, however, is more focused on the brain strain.
Since this network has not changed much during the course of human evolution, it could well participate in the feelings perceived by multiple animal houses.
In theory, I cannot oppose it, but I find this unforgivable.
Pankseep argues that what seems to us to be fear in rats and people is what the two organisms are probably felt the same way: But how is it possible to verify, Pankseep goes on to say, whether rats and people feel the same thing when they behave in the same way?
The cockroach flees the dangers - does he feel fear, too?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of the conduct cannot prove the coincidence of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us on: rats and humans have similar brain tribes, while cockroaches and the brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for the sensations?
And even if it were possible to prove it in humans: how would we like to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who do?) have feelings.
But I really don't know how to do it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from our own (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and on the tongue), I think of emotional behavior rather than emotional perceptions of rats.
In any case, we can see progress at the neural level if we measure the same for rats and humans.
As with rats, I don't examine the tongue and consciousness, I don't even examine feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It is possible to think this is short-sighted, but I am moving forward rather than rushing repeatedly against the wall.
I'm a practical emotional person.
UEFA President Platini: Sleeping Sentence for Poland and Ukraine
Acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasulynyk said preparations would soon be run directly by the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the European Championships together with Poland," Vasuynyk said.
"But it is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has only just started and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the early fulfilment of the timetable for the construction or redevelopment of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the European Championships will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work as quickly as possible now," said the chairman of the Ukrainian union, Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep following us."
An even more radical move was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN union was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport, Mirosław Drzewiecki.
He said there was "a serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish press PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this will not be the step of the preparation for the 2012 European Championships."
Several teams from the first league were doomed to a forced descent in the past season only due to the manipulation, and in the end the league's start had to be hastily moved.
Travel agents record rising bookings
It looks like the winter will be good for German tourism entrepreneurs:
According to one study, the turnover for tour reservations for the next months compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the Germans' appetite for travel remains unlucky.
For winter season bookings, travel agents recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV) said in Berlin on Monday.
According to a survey by the GfK market survey, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
The turnaround was thus about eleven percent higher for October compared to 2007.
The basis for these results are the figures of the GfK, which annually evaluates booking data from 1,200 German travel agents and interpolates them to the overall market.
Included in this result were bookings of the tours, which took place until the end of August 2008.
The weak dollar exchange rate is mainly in demand for travel to the US, DRV said.
For these trips, the addition of reservations makes about one-third.
In addition, the Germans are particularly desirable targets for Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
The organised tours are on course in particular, said DRV chairman Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising expenditure of energy and food, the cost is "imaginable for the client than for an individually organised holiday."
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was said to be very good, so a higher turnover will be recorded again compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans who made some travel has decreased compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to advertise a new film, spoke in an interview about private matters - and now she has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan referred to her former Dennis Quaid as a marriel marriage loser.
He's furious and strikes back.
The belated Rose War of the Above Marrigin and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors are in a nasty quarrel - in the public eye.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan commented for the first time on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis have been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She said she only learned of the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The impetus for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film, "The Women," which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's response to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was distinctive: It's "crazed," the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews down the history of our relationship and edits it."
Moreover, it is "political" that the joint 16-year-old son of Jack once again "replicates the pain and radical changes that are a divorce for every child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of the twins.
He concludes his reflections on the sidelining as follows: "My life goes on, anyway.
I consider it a happy one to have a wonderful family that is doing great."
Prices of tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than the year before.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper by as much as 50 percent, according to one current study.
Flights and hotel accommodation have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by American Express travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its bookkeeping data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant decline in the second quarter after the first-parlat price hike.
After prices on the hotel market grew for several years, accommodation has already become cheaper in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed, the prices rose by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was the most obvious in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The American Express sees the dollar's weak exchange rate as the cause of this trend, which was "a rising appetite for American tourists to travel."
The drop in hotel prices was also more affected by financial centres than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent even set a European record.
Ticket prices also showed an even upward trend in the first quarter:
To increase kerosene, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, fares in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the changes were noticeably less pronounced in the Business and First-Class classes.
In Germany, prices plummeted even more sharply than in other European countries:
They grew 11.9 percent from January to March, down 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
At German domestic flights, according to the cited study, prices fell by half.
One of the reasons for this price fall is slowing economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand in many air transport market segments is uncertain.
On the other hand, increased competitive pressure exists because of the Open Skies agreement, which has liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The tense situation is the cancellation of unprofitable flights by air carriers, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1-0
With one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to form a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - to enlarge the failed landing for representative Marko Marino.
This player from Gladbach did not join the game until late and failed to get punched out by the ball on the stick.
His report was precision-formed, and it came from his mouth convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the Hamburg Arena's booths.
There wasn't much going on in the catacombs, the break between the half-times was over and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a MAV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary players.
And so his plea was also answered in the responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and gave up his thumb as a sign of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His orders were probably the same: with the second goal!
The execution did not occur.
"Everything didn't look at niche here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have been "more relaxed."
1-0 (1-0) The Hamburgen Gives owe a header to Mladen Petrić (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbashans could not have harmed the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summarized.
The Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence this Monday.
As a result, viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena, and a live updated slate on a video wall in which their team was listed as the premier.
It's a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the interim table result symbolizes the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petrić and FC Bayern, won't be found - is slow to be shining, but he can't shine yet.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
My first Oktoberfest
Endlessly repeated ash, tarton and penny beer and prominent men in costumes from well-known designers.
First time in a beer meadow.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV presenter, and she wears a tailored costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is from secondhand.
But one thing brings us together: we're not even three minutes in a beer meadow, and we're already being pounced by photographers, and they're swiftly filling up with memory cards - I'm flattered, it's my first time at Oktoberfest.
This is how you can make friends.
My cheap costume seems to have served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, and so my sense of comfort in the costume was rather limited.
But as soon as it arrived at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone is wearing women's costume or leather trousers; no one is looking disgusted or embarrassingly offended - everything is perfectly normal.
Strange views at the chocolate-covered banana stall are only my apron.
One Munich woman points out to me that I have misconstrued her: "You are free, in the middle of the virgin, entered on the right, widowed at the back."
I'll throw in secret from the back of the bow to the left.
"All right," he says, and laughs.
Others don't deal with the sublime flirting techniques as much, and wear simple felt hats that read "To drunk to get got dressed!" and stick out on the passers-by's naked buttocks.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is called Bob, he's from England, and he's come to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds "gorgeous," with an extended "ōo."
That's what he tells me after relieving himself of a drunk wax.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is garbage bins.
Bob is therefore one of the dreaded "Wildbieslers," as it is called in public in public by free urinating people in Bavaria.
The rest of the happiness to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around 8 p.m., they run around the area where Oktoberfest is held, in droves of medics to take care of the poor drinkers.
Paramedics always appear in flocks - in four they wear a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
They work like most visitors to the beer meadow: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the tarp of this coffin of empoloons cannot be seen.
"That so te that can't go on," one of the medics calls me in response to my question and disappears into the crowd.
After the defeat in the vote
There's a flurry on Wall Street.
Initial reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to drop by as much as 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in one day in its history.
Later, Dow gained weight again.
Around 8:30 p.m., this world's most important stock market barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points at more than seven percent.
The worst was the worst in Dow at the moment, with American Express losing almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Shares in Goldman Sachs lost nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, the company's big-time investor, Warren Buffett, had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called rotten mortgage documents.
However, the entire amount is not to be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state is to receive the stock option certificates of financial companies, which could be reimbursed in the favourable exchange rate development, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock odds in Europe are falling steeply
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not deprive investors of the doubt.
The sharecrope of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is heavily downward and is withdrawing the Dax index.
The US Dow Jones is losing out despite a planned bailout by the state.
The Spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plucked the German stock index (Dax) deep into the red.
Shares in the aforementioned Munich financier of the property lost up to three quarters of its value despite the Federal Government's rescue and private banks, with Commerzbank losing more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6000 mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus of 3.7 per cent.
Worldwide, stock markets went to their knees.
In New York, a business day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that a $700 billion US government rescue package might not be enough to revive events in the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in its first trading hour, making it at 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives has a rescue plan to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate could say a vote. October.
Other European stock exchanges were moving in only one direction: in London, the FTSE initially weakened by 3.2 percent, with the CAC-40 losing 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.09.
In India, the head-froning Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAx, shares in Arcandor lost their share capital after the announcement.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourist concern announced that it would not sell the shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have not known what to do with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general relativity theory might not be quite right.
For nearly 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through space.
The fuel lines, which will soon freeze, they now face death from the cold.
For years, one mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists - the anomaly of the gravity slingshot.
Gravitational slingshot is a aircraft maneuver of space probes, in which they acquire additional momentum in the gravitational field of some space body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
But what scientists have been saying in this case in astonishment for years: the flying bodies are not behaving 100% as one would expect it to be, according to the good old-fashioned law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly speeding up or slowing down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by the anomalies of the gravity slingshots.
Several experts fear that perhaps even the general theory of relativity by Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by curbing the space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study remains convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the gravitational handler's anomaly by using the so-called dark matter, the presence of which was discovered in the universe by astronomers.
"The answer for this anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space for space explorers for about a decade.
It is clearly based on a gravitational force whose effect on other space bodies can be observed.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means that it does not broadcast or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, just or visible light.
According to scientists' calculations, this dark matter makes a good fifth of the total masses of the universe.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are at large
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists are back at large, according to a memo from the Italian foreign minister in Egypt.
The kidnappers of Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In the shootout before the release, he said, six hijackers were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become targets for the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists' impartments in the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabiy and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We are now verifying their health," Frattini said.
According to a report by Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides are in order and safe.
All 19 participants in the expedition to the desert are now apparently on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shootout in the hostage release remains unclear: according to the Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese military surprisingly killed the six hijackers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the quoted worker said.
He said it was "just to take the hostage over," when "this surprise" came suddenly.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in a border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday, and two of them were captured.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing one of the German intermediaries, that the release of the hostages was being dragged out because the kidnappers were worried about their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Police release name of accident victim
The name of a 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was released.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon affected Carole Paulson of the Chelmsford Road there.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was detained on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has already been released on police bail.
Abuse by stepfather "left to suicide"
The several-year-old abuse by the stepfather led the woman to kill herself, he said in court.
After pleading guilty to eight sexual harassment cases, Michael Trerise, 57, of the Stithians of the Ched, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court at Truro heard that he had regularly tied his step-de-dollar daughter, Stephanie Randle, when she was between the age of five and seven.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
The court also told that Ms. Randle was killed at her home in the Mutley in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise was bound by her eyes and then sexually abused by Trerise while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was said in court that Miss Randle, who spent a substantial part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was persecuted by the spectre of abuse that had been committed to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006 they called friends of Miss Randle, who was also very much involved in surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she "relived to her life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her flat in Plymouth.
She's sucked into a succulum with a plastic bag.
Randle facedown in the face of his daughter's stepfather, who had written a confession ending with the words: "I binded her and binded her eyes.
"I didn't use it.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, "You're an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been horrible for your sacrifice when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
All the more terrible is the fact that if she had not done so, the matter would probably not have been made to court at all."
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that, according to Stephani's parents, your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he added.
"Apparently, otherwise, she would probably be a promising, successful, and happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top-secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the train to Waterloo while he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were brought to the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offense against the aforementioned law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
The BBC's Defence Affairs correspondent, Frank Gardner, said such a move would be surprising to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the Ministry and the Cabinet Office," he said.
A staff member who may not be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, a clause dealing with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended the Metropolitan Police indict the official on the very sensitive nature of his work at the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he had forgotten contained secret analyses of Al-Qaeda and the possibilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from home to an unknown location.
Cooperative with creditors facing B&B debt
British credit unions may have to settle out of debt of more than £80 million after the Bradford Bingley bank is rescued.
The government has provided £14 billion to deposit protection for the deposit of 2.6 million clients at Bradford & Bingley.
The interest rates of this loan will be repaid by all firms taking client deposits, including 59 credit unions.
The CEO of the Association of Cooperative Banks (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "affecting" that the credit unions and their members must pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be paid off by the rescued Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that is accumulated in the meantime will be repaid each year by all 700 financial firms that take client deposits.
The Fund The cash capital's cash duty plan for the BBC confirmed that all 59 credit unions were included in this issue.
It is humbling that these institutions that behaved judiciously... must now pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were not nearly so considerate
Adrian Coles, BA
He said that each firm was to pay proportionally to the deposits it held, and that the credit unions were to pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the debt interest will grow to £450 million in 2009.
This means that the credit unions will have to find £81 million to repay the interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Co-Coach Retaliation Trade Association, told the BBC that he believed it was not fair.
"It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved judiciously during the expansion of the housing market must now pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from thoughtful."
According to the BSA, no backup has fallen since they appeared in 1945.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this in the next few weeks to see what are the possibilities to protect the credit unions and their members from an account that might be relevant," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of this September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, it will be up to the repayment of interest for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
As credit unmistakled creditors are creditors, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates in their accounts.
Turkish diplomatic horizons expand
Long before Turkey began to seek to join the European Union, European powers longed to penetrate deep into the Turkish locks.
On the east bank of the Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty paces in Asia, one of the best monuments of this failed Imperial ambition stands.
Hydarpaša railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in the Neo-Renaissance style.
So that's what the tourist guides will tell you.
The building sits astride at the end of the platforms with a tower on each corner of the front, at a glance indistinguishable from some provincial German town hall.
Stone is dirty.
The whole structure is slowly falling apart.
But once you get inside the vaulted coffers, you can't have a doubt about the size of the establishment of which the station was the most western gateway.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium of Anatoly-Babydad corporation.
Germany, which was involved in the game of empires late, intended to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East through the help of this railroad, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond, the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, created by the frozen boundaries of the Cold War, is over
British and colonial troops advanced from Egypt, pushing out the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
And for the Hydarpaša station, too, came the bad news.
In 1917, the explosion of the ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has gradually crumbled and history has been circling it.
But today, this gateway to Anatolia and farther east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the widening horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development - AKP - created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
A new policy is now being applied - Turkey is involved.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fasha, with Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I mounted a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was to meet one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride on the tracks that recalled the old-world rhythms of the well-known documentary Night's Post, I arrived in the Turkish capital, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
It aroused suspicion in the west, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main AKP tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, deliberately built on an evolving suburb, surrounded by half-built store houses and power-sharing bridges, where medium-sized executives in commercial suits - men and women alike - meet to make early morning shops.
Suat Kiniklioglu could well be a center-right politician from nearly every other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry, too.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey to its immediate vicinity.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he told me.
Turkey has been cut off from its locks.
Today, they must look to the east and to the west at the same time.
It was no choice.
It must have done both.
"But surely the time will come," I asked, "when will Turkey have to make a decision?"
"Turkey," he said, "it was not to make such a decision to make."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here said almost from memory: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea surroundings, are equally to the benefit of Europe and the United States as to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, travel on these tracks to the east of Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpaša Station, after another mostly sleepless night, I was thinking of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who watched the building be built a century ago.
How they would be surprised to find that European ambitions in the Middle East can now be, in a substantial part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited at the port for the ferry back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days, Turkey was called the 'sick man of Europe'.
So, at least then, there was little doubt about which continent would be entitled to this fascinating country.
Milk up by fivep in a litre
The people in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pc per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a bipaper hike in February, and it comes after research conducted by a consultancy.
Retailers are to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the hike in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the Jersey wholesale milk price was last changed in 2002.
Bail for Bangladeshi ex-PM rejected
A Bangladeshi court has rejected former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid's request to be released on bail, which means that if she returns to her homeland, she may be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the charge that she had been blackmailed by extracting over fifty million taka ($799,700) when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges against it.
Khalila Ziyah, a longtime political rival to Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the People's League (Awami League), has demanded that the local army-held government first give it complete freedom.
The letter-in-law say that while she was fired on her word of honour to undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear, according to the terms of her release, whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal the High Court's order to the Supreme Court.
"The High Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, saying he did not need bail when he is already undergoing examinations released abroad for a solemn declaration," said her defense attorney, Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal to the High Court order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
A senior People's League official said Sheikh Hasina should return home after 17. October.
She was detained last year after the military-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to allow for medical intervention abroad.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaled Ziaya both reject all the charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not participated in the recent blanket armored vaccination for attempted abuses linked to the Taliban.
The UN was doing vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says she could not have reached children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises that it would not attack or prevent thousands of vaccinatory workers from attacking or preventing them from working.
BSkyB loses ITV litigation
BSkyB lost a lawsuit to review the Competition Commission's decision to reduce the firm's stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Board of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB's stake had been frustated by the competition and gave the company a disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in a deal that prevented NTL, now renamed Virginia, from being named for Virgin Media, to buy ITV in 2006.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had given rise to doubt the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin consortium chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer organisation and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction in its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - primarily because BSkyB had previously said she was willing to relinquish her voting rights.
A new investigation into the American attorneys' affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to examine the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The move came in a situation where the report on the affair, prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmaker and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzals.
The investigation was prompted by fears that the attorneys had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: "The allegations, including potential criminal conduct, have not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys of their office in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the attorneys had been fired because of weak performances.
However, it was later revealed that the dismissed attorneys were no worse rated than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the redundancies were motivated politically.
Some of the attorneys were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican deputies and senators, while others refused to investigate the allegations of deception against the Democrats.
American attorneys are investigating and conducting lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for the redundancies and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Gonzales' role in the affair, saying he bore "main responsibility" for the layoffs, that he had "abdated" from his leadership position and was "unwardly disconnected" in the action.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for her epic anthem, Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will be coming to the ceremony in London for his special gold prize, said he had been "honored" with the recognition.
The song, which lasts for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nominees are led by the Coldplay group, which has been shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, the chief editor of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand over such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached the highest in 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album, Bat Out Of Hell, was listed for about nine years and has been sold worldwide for more than forty million copies.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, and was also operated on in 2003 for irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roads, some famous, some only utility.
But even many taxi-veteran and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village district and runs north from First Street - without making it to Second Street - between the Bowers and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and forty meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic lane.
There are no signs with street names.
In a regular atlas, it's virtually invisible.
Still, the aisle has an admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of the recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to pave the new trip and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbours who say they were enchanted by the shortened aisle simply because it was one of the last relics from before the block was refined.
However, the city's Office for the Protection and Development of the Development, which has the street in its power, has no interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the Municipal Community Land Committee, representatives of the Municipal Authority and Avalon Bay drew a plan to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee favours the option for the street to remain in the hands of the city and requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very few land, and we'd like Extra Place to be held by him," she said.
"Consumwork for repair and administration could be made, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public accessibility."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wanted to pave the small street and plant seating seats, several of which would be used by a café whose interest the developer expects to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokeswoman, said that although the company wanted to use the street, he did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main intention of Avalon Bay is to repair this desolate aisle and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale had been proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Office for the Construction Conservation, said the city had indeed wanted to sell the street, noting that his office's job was to develop the property rather than to manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place, it has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think the street got its name in 1802 when Philip Minthorne's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one made a claim to the narrow strip of land.
The back door of the CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the backdrop of a photograph on the cover of the band's album "Rocket to Russia."
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was littered with garbage, shredded clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about refining the East Village district, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, claiming that the public piece of public property, even a meager, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - an almost unchanged piece of the city, which should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog named Jeremiah's Falling New York (with the subtitle "The Book of the Wailing: a bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), posted part of the story of Extra Place from the Speaking of the City, which appeared in the paper The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the daytime, and bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and hammered windows where a week-old newspaper runs through the gully."
With a few exceptions, the alley of the aisle one of the hours of the day seemed exactly the same.
The rat ran across the culp-depth end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where an expensive clothing store now stands.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of discorded newspapers lay an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said they rarely thought at Extra Place, but suggested that a boost might come in handy.
By contrast, Fields said he thought some people underestimate the appearance of the alley in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "they were in places of dark and damp and disgusting."
Debate on bilingvalita: immersion in English
This edition of the section Focused on Education will be Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi to discuss the candidates' attitude to bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California academics and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-authored "Getter than you think: why the middle class needs to choose schools."
Effectively appealing to Hispanic voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda only proves it.
The Obama campaign observes that "Afro-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white pupils," which is true.
To combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are just learning English.
But the question for Barack Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes that the class's use of languages other than English, is not stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Consider, for example, the Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in Los Angeles County East.
Pupils of this school are, in the vast majority of cases, Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are only learning English.
Even so, in the state's maths tests in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth-grade pupils came to the highest level.
Almost the equally amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level in state tests from the English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities and access without excuses.
Further, and this is what Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, the director of Sixth Street, is the school's teaching approach for those who are just learning in English, "full immersion."
The immersion in English emphasises the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me: "We've had tremendous success with a brand new student from Mexico - after twelve months, you'd walk into a classroom and not recognize which one it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama would take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model, what should other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English-learning pupils look like?
The results the school is up to be made of the answer to this question should take the obvious line, but his own party's educational agenda (National Education Association is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education is unclear about the pretense of Obama's answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should be taught in English, he recently trivialized the matter when he said that people should stop worrying about "only English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wishes to erase the performance gap, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than mock them and trivialize them.
Oil plummeting due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices plummeted on Monday because of fears that even a US plan to rescue the financial markets might not revive the economy.
Prices for term trades in oil fell to as much as 7 percent in early trading on the New York Commodity Exchange to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodities markets have been shaken by the financial unrest on Wall Street, as well as a pair of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel this month earlier this month, with tremendous uncertainties jumping on a wave of financial-market uncertainties.
The anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the Congress Bureau announced that it had reached an agreement over the weekend over the weekend for the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report was overshadowed by fresh fears that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the advancing decomposition, the government announced that Citigroup would buy a banking section of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgian governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the frantic weekend negotiations that led to a plan to save the economy "failure to reap the market feel incapable of reviving the mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
"The outlook for global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become severely insecure," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe the commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the American virus will spread to the world and especially to China."
The bank's analysts have cut their expectations for next year, as oil consumption fell due to slower growth in the economy, and lowered their petrol price forecasts by about 20%.
Wild Ride in the second quarter broke the team's record
Having spent more in the Jets for the last eight seasons than anyone else, defenseman Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then, on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a scoreless game into a spanking drive.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals equalized with their troubled game to the gloomy clouds above each other.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent out Laveranues to a 12-yard drop-out sprint, heralding a perfect afternoon in which their progressive collaboration moved miles ahead.
Favre sent out the Colesse in that quarter for two more touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before the halfway point of the game.
"It wasn't extraordinary," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a hell of a good player.
We've been very good at communicating, whatever people think."
While Favre and Coles bowed, the defense attacked the Cardinals' quarterback Kurtinals Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it to a touchdown 32 yards.
Safety Eric Smith picked up another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner into fumbles.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals came to the ball 10 seconds into the game, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yardime goal from the field to take a 34-0.
That's the most the Jets have ever gotten in one-quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer - Mangini said: 'I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
It scored many points in a short space of time."
Rested Gebreselassie improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia showed once again why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever, when he broke his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile-long race in under two hours and four minutes.
With a victory on a pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 to overcame by 27 seconds of his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, set the 26th world record for his career, which is truly incredibly wide - breaking the world record or at least being the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped the Olympic Marathon in Beijing because he was - perhaps too alarmed in retrospect - that the polluted air would irritate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a flash-granted average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As far as the track runners such as the Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have focused on longer runs, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf's back two weeks ago and missed a week of practice.
The break was evidently more buzzing than delaying him.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I was a little bit in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticized - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for the fact that he was said to be over-plan planning his races, generally avoiding the world's marathon leaders, relying on conductors as if it were a track race, and set world records above the sense of the competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie's enormous running quality.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenya, Gebreselassie reached the half in a time of 1:02:04.
After the conductors dropped the rafters, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Khenko runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little earlier than three miles from the goal Gebreselassie took the last time and ran away from Kwambai, who then ran to second place at 2:05:36 to improve his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, the only successful year to complete history's seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19, Irina Mikitěnková, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a citizen of Germany.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff of the UK.
The 36-year-old Mikitěnko surprisingly won the London Marathon at 2:24:14 last spring.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something described as a back injury but recovered and won in Berlin and improved her personal best by almost five minutes in the third marathon she had ever run.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ayiopa and Kenyan cross-country skaters escape to a big lead, and then dragged them down after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in a time 2:25:01.
The pride and impediment of the life of blacks in a separate city
Hidden among the raucous amusement parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city in which the pride and difficulty of African-American life is brought to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as easy as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three crocumatas, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, a recipient of navy, two schools and no prisons."
It is now a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eyonville festival Zora! to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains sidelined, though it has made it a stop for tourists by including him in a Florida-based tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project from the economic crisis.
It is still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that country blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who "failurers about us that he doesn't even know what he's missing."
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many of the residents remain cautious about the views of the foreigners.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city's oldest parish.
"It must be the right thing to do."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and exertion.
It is both a historical model of the black rise and the community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a centre of literature, but also an oak-shaded example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that arose from American slavery.
It is not very surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the fear of the Eatonville idea really did come about with Zora, which is the only way Hurston is called here.
She presented her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of dialects such as "Mules and Men (Mules and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watch God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city a short distance to Route. 17, which runs through the often-extended center of Florida, in the stage of black history and the human drama.
With the vigour of a big drum in her life and in the literature, Hurston led the reader to the store of the first Esanville Mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more personal places.
"October to the side of the road," she wrote, "it's a white brown-adorned national school with well-maintained backyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always takes care of, even if he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband, Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits into an hour-long hotel."
So, in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, resuscitation of marriages and sex.
This was obviously not the typical publisher of Fodor's.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says ninety-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the gleerenesses of Johnson's girls, who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chipper-based eccentric, which she often came back after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers most of the time she rushed into town, arriving unannounced in the huge Chevrolet, smoking, and wearing trousers in the city, which is still proud of her dignified dress.
Most of the population was fascinated, Franklin said, but many were sneering.
"People have always enjoyed seeing Zor," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging in a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "has never stayed for very long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor, and her books were removed from the press.
Eatonville, along with the rest of the world, seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourners or major public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood its significance for the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston biography "Wrapped in Rainbows" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to extend the city's five-way highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is the local two-lane main road.
The spill of Orlando had already pushed the crosses of Interstate No. 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still coming out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to mix races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white boys, they came in and threw oranges and stuff at the people who were siding with," Franklin said.
"In fact, we had a lady who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, and said of his decision in the Brown case against the Education Chamber that he was "opposing than glorifying for my race."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the country's youth.
"The Blacksmiths were used to hugs - I remember - you hugged your teacher this morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit Preserve the Eatonville Community (Save the Eatonville Community).
This lasted until the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Miss Nathiri said.
Nevertheless, civil rights have helped create a space for many more of Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudice with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How anyone can deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker travelled to the unmarked tomb of Hurston and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, he came to the shelves of the bookshop's tournament vaunted Hurston's biography by Robert E. Hemenway, which reinstated it in the American canon.
The project with the highway arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter found the ramp lights again.
The former Hurston neighbors now considered her a saviour.
To show what the state of ruin with its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inauguration event two years later, and each January many are returning to the celebration.
The state backed down from the highway proposal after several years.
"The five streams of the highway resurrected, you'd say it's detonated, real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the motorway project helped to change the city's image.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-storey library (named after Hurston, of course) was opened in 2006 at the asphalted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes act as a backwater alley in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come to find the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is to have in advance and certain things - such as murals in the oldest Eysonville church, painted by white people and depicted by black people in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, the courageous, self-assured teacher who likes the deep red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston festival got bigger, domestic pride has also increased.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as seen by Hurston as she saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so, but not better, not worse and equally proud, creative, hard-working, foolish, foolish and varied as other American races and ethnicities.
The voice of Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, is a sincere love for the community when he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, who she says would take some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11-year-old twins from the Winter Park Alondra and the Alexia Kenon, they seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass through here, think, 'Hm, this town is nothing compared to the others,' " Alondra Kenon said recently after the church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look at the history for a while, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak fluently in financial terms
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If the tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from the newsstands and the huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the glass-enclosure of the offices above their heads, the bankers and managers of the investment funds who monopolige New York have the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still rattling the metal carts down the sidewalks and transfer the muffin baking trays to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between the towers and wear, like human mules, the fifty-fty-treated shirts that hang from the weights on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street food stalls, and it's still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday on a weekday yellow taxi between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until I decided, with all the talk of pessimism, to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had timed this task to coincide with a late-extin-after-extradition siesta at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people waiting in the queue.
Not in front of the cash-run windows to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of the counter where the older clients book their checkbooks, tourists ask about the trip to the Macy's mixed-odry store, and new customers set up bills.
Most of the people before me, I learned from Starr, my "lichen-stamped personal banker," came for the same reason I did.
But compared to me, they've already collected their savings from smaller banks in the places they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They have collected money from the so-called thrifts (a little similar to building societies), the monetary associations and the types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state, and claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly collapsed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, the $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt to bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with assets for $440 billion, was trying to catch a rescue buyer.
Staff at the offices and shops who stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse were moving their cash to a bank that is seen as a safe haven and that does most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluent financially in the last week.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket was speaking on the phone and commented on Lehman Borthers, the bankrupt bank, and her emaciated senior executive, Dick Fulde, with such familiarity, as if she were jubilant about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed housekeeper of my tenement in his 50-year-old, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, "I have my savings in the money market funds now.
I've moved it, I won't risk."
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (an unprotector, 11 September) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the district music plan, he founded a year on this by the excellent choir of the young Proteus.
He was supposed to be under 21, but by the time the Proteus sang for the last time in 1979, there were almost 30 of us - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mytological shapes' inactor) represented the giver and ability of the choir to embark on any music presented to him - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and all because of the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained completely unchanged throughout.
How often did Tod just tell us to "let music speak for ourselves."
He said, "The Tunister knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
Sing it, then! "
His baton technique was crystal clear and precise, but neither dictatorial nor florid.
Wherever the musical standard was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a conductor was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades, when he conducted the Guildford Philharominsky from 1962 to 1982.
I've reviewed more than 100 of his concerts in the last 40 years or so, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed in any of them - and I've been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had this great combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "dragged one or two soaked stones around the world."
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes in :
Your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25) claims that he "return to the economic history of Oxford in 1946 and became a researcher at Houblon-Norman in 1950... and also studied at BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on the author's remark in the Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the time he completed his dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as a publication by the British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the Illinois, Harvard and New York University.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff has passed this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated after Austria's right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from Austria's right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of Belgium's right-wing Vlaams Belang party, is attending a rally that presented the "City against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to the "City Against Islamization" organization.
They carry signs similar to the traffic signs that depict mosques crossed out by the red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria over the same weekend in which the extreme right-wing parties made huge gains in the general election.
Over 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were heavily damaged sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police believe it was an organized event.
The culprits spray-painted some of the graves with Jewish symbols, such as David's star, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to disguise the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether this incident was in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the Islamic community here said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of the desecration that comes as the Muslim Lent Month of Ramadan is nearing the end.
Meanwhile, Austria is entering the round of searching for its own soul after swinging to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, conducted a vehemently anti-immigration campaign, and some of their slogans were condemned by critics as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the chairman of the Freedom Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against headscarves and burqa in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to the foods in which the relationship to Islam is perceived.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out immediately after the election that put the extreme right on the position of the country's strongest political bloc, suggest that this change was mainly due to young voters who are worrying about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter not allowed to go on a trip across the border
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned by the court from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed the six-month ban on Glitter after informing monitoring authorities that he planned to travel via France to Spain.
Kent police were approved for the travel ban last Thursday after handing over to officials evidence of Glitter's past child abuse convictions.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
A judicial service spokesman said: "On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford's lowest criminal court, the CEC Police requested a regulation to prevent Mr Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as required by a record of sexual assaults.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also hand over the scheduled departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent Police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible trips to the district.
A spokeswoman for the Centre Police said: "The CEC Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to watch someone who stays in Britain, because we have large-scale systems that handle potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Chen Police, and we are working carefully to monitor the behaviour of the recorded sexual assailants in order to minimise any danger to the public."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok to fly to London.
But he said he was not feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his attorney, David Corker, went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London, while at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order requiring him to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the UK for four months for possessing child pornography.
A homeowner at the Home Office said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was calm and glad that Glitter had been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I'm taking pictures of the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no ruffles or costumes.
Only the essence of the great flamenco, disengaged from the focus on the interpretation - I just reach the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other, man.
It will not be out of the question, apart from privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then awareness of a confidential gesture, a glimpse of the sight, or the passionate gesture of the hands that are carefree because they are not going to appear on the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in the "Flamenco-people" theatrical performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer assembles a unique flamenco iconography from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the programme Month Photographs (Mes de la Photographers Flamenco), "reflects the ever-growing international meaning of flamenco," says the author, explaining that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These "on the street" portrait artists are able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the scene... and completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco greats.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portrait of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the selection of the camera and material, resemble a classic photo.
The use of different stylistic means is at odds with the film's classical basis and bestows on it with the current spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, is mirrored by flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which continues to surprise and evolve."
What teases the audience is not the work of the dance itself, the singing or the play, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we encounter the most essential, the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and experiencing, was and is a constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of nearly seventy photographered artists is shaped by well-known flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo, among others.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco and will soon receive a book edition that will include the exhibited portraits.
The passion for portrait brought Bauer to the idea of repeating the idea of "SportARTproject" ("SportARTproject" on the "Partyte).
Although their concept is different from the "Flamenco-people" concept, the photographer admits that "taking pictures of people, getting to know them and have the opportunity to enter their lives for a moment, whether longer or just short - that is my passion.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
One meets or encounters people, personalities who sometimes don't even know, or are given just a few minutes for a photo shoot.
Despite the circumstances of similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
A collection of contemporary flamenco portraits called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the El Fotómata Gallery in de la Mata 20 street, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16. October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he writes is "trouplously"
It takes place in an environment he does not yet know and tells of the events of the unknowns, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement his new project - he is currently working on a novel, the main character of which is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and also traveled in the Amazon.
The eternal favourite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that currently employs him "is audacity" and that "all suggest that I should not write" the novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe I will finish it someday," he concluded at the festival's contribution at the festival of exchanges of ideas, ideas and words, which in the four days saw in the city of an aqueduct around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
The author of the novel, "City and Dogs," was one of the main characters in the third edition of the Word Festival and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the Most Popular Writer - the old edition of Dickens's "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo Theatre to the last place.
With Félix Romeo, who introduced him, he had a resigned audience in front of him, the hour of time passed like water - the Peruvian, with an astonishing precision and a lot of humor, recalled how he made it a close-up of "a disappointing adventure" from "the joy of a passionate reader" and from "to live more than what I have done" gave birth to the literary mission; as he supersedes the "non-government of inspiration" by writing "disciplined," carefully stalling, correcting and rewriting the lyrics, correcting and rewriting; or how they influenced his writing Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what "remembrance images" were the supporting foundation of his stories.
The Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way to find out if and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is mere fun, a fleeting experience" - pointed out by Vargas Llosa, saying that he said "it works for people" and "make them out of lineage," and called on the writer not to "subject frivolity" and "take responsibility" on their mission.
Because of the climatology, he loses the festivities in Pozoblancu - a lavoy
The spear performance, which concludes the festivities in Pozoblanc, was cancelled yesterday morning after the performers' announcement was confirmed that the surface of the square was not in good condition.
That is why the company, along with Fermín Bohórquez, Pabloem Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Adverse meteorological conditions have plagued the festivities in the long term, with two of the three celebrations not being able to take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfighting.
During these, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was to be built for the bulls in the arena at Castilblanc.
But this was only celebrated on Fridays.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was brought to the shoulders by rewarding a dynamic and aesthetically high-quality performance.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two shots with spear for greetings and one ear, which had been brought to him by the open-air seats in the arena than the art of the bullfighter.
Worse still, El Juli, who had walked through the bullpen of the Los Llanos bullpeny, was not lazy.
In the second round of toil without a breather, he drew harsh criticism from most of the audience.
They ran out of check-up in Álava in a van with 2,000 kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes five.
Ertzaintza Roadside in the district of Armiñón (Ala).
Members stop two people driving in a van and they are speeding away.
The cargo, more than two tonnes of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, they were persecuted by members and detained by one of the people riding in the van, a man aged 38, who was identified as A. A. J.
The detainee was charged with drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several Transport Unit officers conducted a roadside inspection at the N-1 in the places where it passes through the border of the Armiñón district.
They were about to stop the van for inspection, but the driver disobeyed the instructions, accelerated sharply and drove off.
The officers immediately began to chase the car until the vehicle stopped at the side of the road a few kilometers away, at which point the two passengers jumped out and fled to the woodland.
Ertzaintzy eventually caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as revealed during a search of the Iveco Daily van.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with a hash bale, which were subsequently taken to other police departments for detailed expertization and the weight of the drug.
In addition, police have determined that the license plate is "squirting" and disagreeing with the data provided in the delivery documents, the detainee was therefore also charged with falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, has managed to escape to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
Detained A. A. J., 28, was taken to the police department to handle the appropriate formalities before proceeding with further investigation later.
Actress Heather Locklear detained for driving under the influence of medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the series Melrose Place, was detained in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend for driving under the influence of medication.
A witness saw her perform unusual manoeuvres while trying to leave the Montecito parking lot, a California Road Patrol spokesman told People.
The witness clarified that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear "went in the gas, moved forward and back in the back and forth, trying to get out of the parking space - running over her sunglasses as she backed up."
The witness, who did not appear to have recognized the actress at first, saw Locklear moments later stopping at a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the emergency services because "had fear for Locklear's life."
When a police patrol arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside the vehicle that partially blocked the roadway.
"She looked disoriented," so the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to submit to the test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were immediately out of the question, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was evident at first glance by the officers."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of the unspecified substance and was taken into custody at around 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic to recover from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU association to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The U IU and MEP for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that a final decision in the case of the former councillor of the Youth and Sports Department of the City Hall in Seville, Manucolor Manucolla Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of dealing on behalf of his family, will be dependent on the party's regional association.
"I am too federalist for this, it is up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares suggested of the negotiations the party will have to proceed with in relation to a former member of the Sevilla city council.
However, the IU chief insisted that in the case of the investigation into the illegal conduct committed by Silva, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions."
"May Blood" ('Sangre de mayo'), an epic gamble by Garcia
In "The May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's Episodes from the national past, is reviving the Spanish's glorious uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around €15 million.
In this way, the film-maker wanted to "draw the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of the company" he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, along with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during the presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of performers.
May's blood with a metric of over two and a half hours will be released in theaters this Friday, and a more than four-hour series for Telemadrid television is in the future.
As a great admirer of Galdós' literary work, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled a "children's dream" by making this film, owing to Esperanza Aguirre, who tasked him with making a film for the bicopold anniversary of Madrid three years ago, he accepted the offer, saying that the plot would be based on the Epizod National Past.
The 15 million budget, to which the Madrid Province contributed completely, marks a "unique opportunity" for Garci to create an environment with backdrops and costumes matching the image of "the crispy Spain, which was mistaken in the leader for whom he could fight - the struggle for independence led under the reign of Ferdinand VII to the decline and backwardness of the country," he said.
But the director regrets not to count on the financial support given to the films The Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goya's Ghosts - almost double the Flower Blood - so he could not make some scenes from a script signed at the same time by Horatio Valcárcelo, with whom he works for almost the entire film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver a empezar) works as he is commonly used to - on the scene, along with the actors with whom he usually rehearsals before filming and which he does not choose by casting, because it seems "sophilic" and also believes that "part of the director's profession is to go to theatres and cinemas, among other things, and thus learn what is happening in the craft he is engaged in."
Many of the actors he selected for the May Blood appear in front of his camera for the umpteenth time, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, with four Oscar nominations, winning one of which he has won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, May's Blood, the Seven Tables of the French Bilire and the last selected Blind Sunflower, claiming that "it will only emerge."
For this film, Garci does not expect any awards.
"At first you think you work for what happens after that, but then you realize that you only work for profit, so you submit to make one more film," explains Garci, with a career from over 30 years of directing.
Isabel Bayón revives the spiritual legacy of Sevilla dancer Tórtoly Valencia
The Seville flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Sevilla dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusanka (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and moved with her family to London when she was three years old.
She danced modern dance and focused on Oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering female emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought to abolish a corset that made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was enchanted by Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she suggested this character to me - it seemed unbelievable."
According to the dancer, "I'm not about telling her life, it's about grasping her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So the "twent's butterfly" evoked me to the guajir or "snake's dancch" of a thong.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also fits this aesthetic," he claims.
The show is expected to involve two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Povedou, who will sing to Isabel in one performance as well as in the "Open Door" (La puerta abierta), and with the dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to work with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the older Tórtol, a mature figure.
I'm happy she's accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it's a great honor for me."
The performance also includes the music and guitars of Jesús Torres and Pac Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; the drums El Pájar, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfry Juárez, "who plays the role of an eternal guide to this kind of female artists, who are all prima donnaami, and who are always in love with them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, which took place for its time in such far-off places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as across Europe, because she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who have a huge influence at some point, but today no one knows her and appreciates her even less then," says Bayón.
The show begins at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Arts
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resina's "Flamenco and Life" because his documentary black-and-white photographs are amazing.
They attracted me to me with the simplicity and powerful charge with which it affects the audience, and the consideration and respect for the photographers.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
The Resino can capture magical moments."
The book "The Daily Married" closes with the triennial
The launch of the first illustrated edition of the "Freshly Married Daily" at Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government to celebrate "Trienále Zenobie and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), held to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the Anniversary of Their Death.
The "Serosia and Juan Ramón" is coming to an end with the new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Onen Sunbeat" which opened in May of this year, and, after touring various Andalusian provinces, are scheduled to move to New York, according to plans for the congress to move to New York.
The Cultural Council of the Andalusian Government also commissioned eight hundred copies of the "Freshly Married Daily" adapted by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis, to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the most sane Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like it so much anymore
"Sometimes God makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Evil Effort" and, under the weight of the knowledge that Newman left, reveals his dismal vision of abandoned American cinema and all of America.
Look how it took them to get Oscar.
And that he had been retired since 2007.
And that it was known that he was gravely ill.
He was a man for everyone, though.
"Sometimes you can't express what you feel in any way, and now I've lost a great friend," Robert Redford said tearfully, "my life and my lands were better because of it."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The film's father and father died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-esteem is at the bottom, when they are desperately seeking reasons for pride.
When the times are rough and the people without virtue, and only a handful of those who are worth admiring - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from the Foundation Against Drug Addiction, based on the honor of the firstborn son, who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home-grown food and organic food.
A total treasure for a country that has been taken in a lot of effort to get away from a suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood, regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that it was not one man who died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-renched man for directing Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the pinnacle of his career without exaggeration.
The evil boy of Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"The fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who nowadays has the courage to try to live as the life of Paul Newman - prides himself on honesty and runs a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But luckily, people like that are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal, though he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a filet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be accompanied by pride in the earth that there is a juxtaposition on earth between his daughters and admirers - it is not very common in America.
It is said that "from all the great roles he embodied, he was the proudest of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather and a dedicated philanthropist."
The perfect races of the Olympic Madrid
Yes, many of us are eager for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failed year of 2012, it will be possible 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we're going to be in charge of last night's race, I'm saying: no!
He was referred to as a perfect race, and in my judgment he was the worst I'd ever been on.
Such a bunch of nonsense that right away, if it came to the evaluation and I was the examiner, it would be clearly inadequate.
But let's look at it from the start, one at a time.
Nonsense begins with the pick-up of the racing number, which makes you want to go early.
That doesn't seem bad to me, but if you go there, let them give them everything (including a chip to prevent the trajectory from being overcrowded).
Oh, no.
Here you had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there just for that) and (after standing the proper queue) - what surprise! - they only had a T-shirt Size S (second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
Where do we live?
Have they decided to buy only small T-shirts because of the crisis, because it's less of a substance and they're cheaper?
Okay, of course, that's the little things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it had to be for the chip very early and the queue lasted for over 15 minutes, he had to hand himself over to his backpack there.
Over 35 minutes took a waiting time, which is something incomprehensible at the race where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as expected, the race started and we haven't put down our backpacks yet, and when we did, it was much worse with the pick-up.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes by the rain, leading to a general rebellion and attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, will not see the right time in the evaluation of the results because of the chip they gave me and which I assume did not record the start time correctly.
Of course, if someone had asked me about a perfect race, this one would not have occurred to me.
And so I think we will only have to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT New Technology Conference, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction in the form of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks like calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the company's compound) and perceive what he hears in the interview.
Thanks to the camera and the system that recognizes the shapes and faces, this "recepcriptional" can find out how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they are wearing - and to listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
He can also sort out those present by conversational groups.
In a demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that she does not belong to the group that speaks to her, and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's going to see someone, telling her to attend to her in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
Tempting.
But of course that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There was a lot of talk this week about a change in Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer had discovered that if computers had only the essentials, without the credit of commercial uselessness, they would be five times more efficient - man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discover as thunder, considering that Microsoft's version is adding new features to Windows and other "extra" versions.
Changing the course would be a worthy act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its meaning, and so on is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned toward the theory that it was Google's first move to a competitive contest with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
She has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never go away, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system, not as the absolute truth, but of the relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, conversely, to a more internet browser.
The computer turns on to launch Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we spend more time on the internet every day than around windows.
What is the use of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now keen to offer its services online and finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here I have a little example.
I took this photo in a break room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine that pleads with them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, the delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, let's count it with 2010 instead.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computer.
With Android and iPhone already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it to the Côte d'A.'s Côte d'Aye, with Leonardo di Caprio shining in one of Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond" in Francis Ford Coppola's "Godfather" and is also part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to embark on the list of his life's roles, we can dive in the image of a typical, pointed moustache muscle that lifts the weights in the nomadic circus.
Basically, it's no more than a typical cotton men's undercover, tight-fitting and sleeveless.
English speakers call him 'tank' but le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels above everyone else.
First, for his breakneck name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which is related to the sport, because, as the legend tells me, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above the other quality cotton, unisex by cut, distinguishing the label and (almost unforgettable) Belgian flag, which has the models of the most like a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian firm is not only specialising on the tank tops.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton trousers, navy T-shirts, outfits for children, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to be just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
Honda hits for the second time with its bestseller
In the month of November, Honda will launch a second-generation Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-seat vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is compounded by improved engines that increase the comfort of the ride and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
Such is the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically, the lines of the new Jazza are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes to this one-tricat car.
It is worth mentioning, for example, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the launch of the first generation.
That's why the first thing we're going to notice is that Honda needed a shorter period to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz is a lesser-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case for Japan, the country where the Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, as well as during this year.
It has been in Japan that nearly a million units have been sold since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market became the old continent, with approximately half a million units sold in six years.
However, the goal of the new Jazz to boost sales in its category.
That is, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Honda Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates are projected to be 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazzu, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 units for the whole year.
It is the arrival of the new Jazz that will make it possible for Honda to significantly ease the decline in sales in Spain.
The automaker's management thus de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a 16% drop.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% from last year.
Then, in 2010, the Japanese firm expects to reach 2%.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the success of its next new model.
It is a Honda Insight, a five-door-sized compact-size hybrid with a length of 4.37 metres, from which the Japanese company expects to sell around 200,000 a year worldwide.
As far as markets are concerned, according to estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight is sold in the United States, while the old continent and Japan split the remaining percentages.
The launch of Honda Insight is expected to launch in the first months of next year as it is presented to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, all dimensions have been enlarged for the new Jazz.
Its length increased to 3.9 metres (up five centimetres more), the width to 1.69 metres (two centimetres more) and the wheelbase to 2.5 metres, which means an extension of five centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 metres.
The larger size was also enlarged.
This advantage was achieved both by using a new platform and by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which had already been used for the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the luggage capacity - which has a double-bottom system - increased to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the volume of the first-generation luggage compartment.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur for the 1.4 engine version, as the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Another improvement, in addition to external features - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipment with a glass panoramic roof - is easier to access the rear seats.
The door leading to the second row of seats allows the opening angle of 80 degrees compared to the first Jazz.
For the second-generation Honda Jazz, the engines are new.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two 1.2 and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology that allows lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions and deliver an excellent improvement in the propulsion system at the same time as high torque in full engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine has a power output of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had a Jazz 78 horsepower for the previous generation - has a 5.3-litre consumption and a 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Compared to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower for the previous generation, the current one will reach 100.
The 100-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4 has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
"I want to be a young mother. I'm not worried about who's going to be a father."
The tremendous resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz, though of small build, is a life-filled woman.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new performance in fashion very seriously.
For Mónic, this means a lot more than just lending some pretty, famous girls their name.
In Paris, she attended a graduation event held by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most significant fashion awards that the Spanish company sponsors.
She is both cordial and timid and will win you up close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this year's autumn-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentin.
It was a challenging but also exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season, based on?
I and my sister love films from the '50s and '60s, and we drew many of them from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk around dressed, how they combine and layer their clothes, I do that very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but after all, it's all connected and has many connections.
I'd enjoyed my clothes when I was a kid, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's house, go through my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the fair.
Then when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of the way I wore to the dress.
You know, we dancers pride ourselves on how we are edited to feel comfortable in our hours and rehearsals when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you actually break into the character.
So it's all connected, but with a lot of respect for the designers and the professionalism.
You were a 30th you recently had a crisis?
No.
I feel better than I've ever felt before, I enjoy 30s.
I find that the woman is already finished, has experience and she relishes her life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've been doing what I want to do, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mum, I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But I know one thing for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and raise him with great affection.
As for the film, you're now in for several premieres of the films you made last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to coming to the cinema.
I come from the theater world, and so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and of course I can't.
I look forward to the premiere of "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you're going to like...
A few days ago, you had your premiere on the catwalk alongside Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to step on the pier as a model.
I was merely called by Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her "Women for a Better Life" organisation, and the clothes we were showing - I also selected two models from our Mango collection - was auctioned off and the proceeds were handed over to this Naomina NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
A lot of things are said to be said about her, and I, knowing her, can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but when she asks me to do a handstand, I'll do it, too.
I will do what I need in the benefit of third-world women.
"Auto bee" prevents rainfall
To advance the development of anti-accident technologies, Nissan was this time inspired by nature, specifically by bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes bee flying as a model, thus preventing collisions.
Such is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
Engineers of the Center for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. developed the robot in collaboration with the Centre for Progress in the scientific and technology research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhir Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology, R&D of the brand, BR23C is presented as an extension of the Nissan security shield's four zones.
The robot is designed to strengthen the ability to prevent precipitation in the brand's cars.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan's safety shield.
The most important, however, are the folded bee's eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, which the bee allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
In creating this visual feature, the engineers designed what they called the Laser Range Finder.
This records obstacles that are located up to a distance of two metres within a 180-degree radius of the BR23C, calculate the distance of the object and sends out the signal to the on-board microprocessor, which will immediately convert it to a collision warning.
"The moment the obstacle is recorded, the robot mimics the bee movements and immediately changes the direction of the wheel to the right or even larger angle to prevent the collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that all evasive maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and the main engineer at this project.
The robot, unlike bees, cannot move upwards or downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited to two dimensions and to the direction that is made possible by rotating its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and options as for bees.
Nissan, therefore, in addition to acceleration and slowing down, used the rotation function to prevent the robot from colliding.
"The facility only needs to process the information every few seconds and act according to these data.
It does not require the preservation of information or logical intuitions from previous manoeuvres, which allows it to function without interruption with only two dozen kB of memory.
It may come as a surprise to you, but we don't talk about the gig or the mega at the memory.'
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for immediate precipitation prevention, a technology for which Nissan predicts use in serial cars in a decade.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and lasts longer than lithium-ion.
Another possible future use of this technology could be to install the unit in the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to their destination, avoiding obstacles on the road.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior is demanding that a driver with three administrative penalties for drunk driving must have to install a system in his car to prevent him from starting a drunk car or if he is not in a breather.
The proposal became known in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will take one year.
Its aim is to return the driver behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to complete a course in the transport re-education course.
In addition to the National Transportation Safety Authority, the General Directorate for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for the Cargo Safety for the Technology for Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between the 30 and 75% of the car drivers charged more than once for drunk driving in this state, get behind the wheel again.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures alcohol level in the exhaled air and prevents the car from being started if the driver is not in danger of failing to improve his or her or her or her or her or her or her or her alcohol concentration is impediment to an alcohol limit.
Its price exceeds €1,000 and the culprit himself would have to pay for it.
A study conducted to this effect in the US in 2007 showed that for vehicles equipped with this equipment, offences decreased by 65 % during the first year of introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that 115 people could save the lives of the lives each year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to address this behaviour before resulting in a criminal offence.
And to help its implementation, as the legislation can be implemented in the usual way, but the necessary legislation of the criminal provisions requires an amendment to the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although it has already been tested for some industrial cars and public service vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) proposal, recommending that it be used to install this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5:40 p.m., as it said in the program, it landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Juárez Airport in México D. F. a Spanish air force plane in which the prince and the princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was setting, but its rays were still forcing their eyes to be blocked with their hands to see the successor pair ascending from the plane.
Below the steps stood the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish prince and the princess were coming to a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, you can't get to the airport to get people to the airport... She's from here or what...
-No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
Yeah, well, all right...
But the Mexican press knows well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport close to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire a salvo of honour.
The prince appears smiling on her lips in a dark blue-colored suit, and the princess, dressed in very sparingly and with her hair flowing, has no common "peeptoes" appear to have been reported to her that in D. F. threatens a storm.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegations are waiting, they smile at the photographers and casually pose for them.
A Mexican TV reporter is waiting at the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the city's four-time hotel.
Enjoy your fear before you take out a mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury Department, in addition to having enough capital to distribute by injection, is not lacking in inventiveness.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking rents at banks with dubious solvency, it created a popular-educational game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
Or "Hotel of Bad Credits"... or a confused hotel.
The hotel, and its receptionists in particular, look grim to think once, twice or three times about whether it was the time to apply for credit.
Above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, though not very detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the whole public.
And what happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel, a dream room appears.
At least something, because you'd better not talk about buying the house...
Best Subsidized Fashion Price
There is probably no more suitable place to announce a fashion award in the world than Paris, and it is probably not a more exquisite designer and bonafide than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to enable the international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is subsidised at €300,000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of her first year, yesterday looked at her designs in the Manga window on Paris's Haussmann Boulevard 54 and was almost weeping with emotion.
To be sure, it is the company's second largest deal in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square metres.
The largest is in London.
Many of the events, along with the desire to thank the designer, Valentino, for taking the presidency of the competition jury, have meant that we finally dined in the Paris Opera House of the Garnier.
The Mango firm's solemnly decorated chairman's desk looked a little more amazing next to Chagall's most gorgeous works.
Nati, who had given no notice of heartbroken grief because of her brother's recent death, wore the brand's dress and the ELAH jewelry, over which he held his breath, and hung on to his son Luis - a nearly two-meter-tall dandy - accompanied Valentina at the head of the table at dinner in his honor.
Andik, the chief executive and owner of Mango, took up the welcome and, as a true gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild were left without a jacket, as they were both offered to two ladies.
Mónicu Cruz, who arrived at the store in the - self-designed - trousers and shirt and changed into a long black sexy dress for dinner was touched by the Opera Walk accompanied by Goyi Toledo, showed us the ballroom for the ballet rehearsal, and, remembering other times, she caught one of the poles and hinted at "grand alobe."
Inés Sastre did not stay on the tour of the palace's adorescence, but showed us pictures of her son on her mobile phone before leaving.
The next morning we could enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who had come to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own bedding and towels and asked in advance that no smell be used in his rooms.
Stars under the star Parisian sky.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
To make matters worse, they are all summarized in one book that will bring to the bookstore relaxation on September 30.
The alarm rings at 7 o'clock every morning as a penalty, but even worse is to imagine yourself absorbed in the hurried rhythm that brings contemporary life.
The office is called the voltage and the computer is back pain.
Stress is a 21st-century sickness.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat the daily exhaustion and the problems of disengaging from the world of work.
No, the number is no bigger than 1001.
Outside of yoga positions, classical massage and "spa" therapies on her book's website, Susannah Marriott collected the entire "menu" of possibilities, adapted to the tastes and time possibilities of each individual.
The counter-storey book is called "1001 How to Relax" and, thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK, the publisher will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "leg" denies this view.
In addition, it offers other practices to be in touch with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you are no longer in the veins of the adrenaline that restores the balance in your body, and the stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, turn off and concentrate on reading.
Speaking of sleep
Some of the kids talk at night.
I don't mean the ones who wake up and tell us briskly about what happened the day before, but the children who talk while they sleep.
The first time it happens, it may startle you, but it's actually insignificant.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilokievica.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one of you told you that he was talking in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime in high fevers), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once every week, once every few months...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is not just one reason to explain her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night-time marshes, enuresis nocturna (night bed-wetting) or sleepwalking, but it may not be so.
As previously mentioned, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or heated situations.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears varies as well.
A child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (creams, cries, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests with great force, it would be advisable to observe and consult a specialist with a specialist to see if he has any problem, which causes him great anxiety and manifests himself in this way.
We said it was a harmless disorder, so it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, what we can do is to bear in mind some very simple preventive measures, such as:
Trying not to upset the child too much before going to bed.
So to find quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or shows.
For very nervous children and those who can be freed up to work, it is possible to use relaxation techniques to help them get some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more restless.
When somnilokievies appear, try to keep calm.
Remind yourself that it is harmless to the child and that he will remember nothing from what was happening the next day.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It's pointless because he's not conscious and you'll interrupt his sleep.
Even when he talks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Remember that if you dream of suffering a lot of times in a row, it would be advisable to turn to for advice or find out what causes such an anxiety in the child.
If he understands what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to question him and pull information out of it.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, she's not conscious to organize her thoughts.
Plus, you'll hear what he's saying, but you don't know what he's dreaming about, and therefore why he's saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you're coming to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not even for fun.
This causes great anxiety.
Don't worry about it, it's not a bad thing, it's just an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Finally, after a long, lean-and-minded period, Illhaeusern found his way back to victory.
Without playing a particularly big game, the Yellow-blacks created more chances and were able to convert one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this encounter in which the attackers found it difficult to assert themselves.
After the captain's first attempt, the captain hosts Kauffmann, who narrowly missed the link with a long shot, Illhaeern began to have a slight upper hand and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne through the air, Romain on a long leg or Diebold gradually came to irritate Dannemarie's defense.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the field, leaving only the agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to two Dannemaria's two chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the scoring for the Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by the Marais, well-hitted to handle the ball reflected after the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, the Illhaeusernu goalkeeper did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the locker room and leave his teammates in the downswing.
However, Dannemarie was unable to benefit from it, and the eleven of Illhaeern, who just pulled back a little to "cover" the defence, had no longer caused any major trouble, with the exception of the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the crossbar after much confusion.
Sarkozy goes to the angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy takes a detour through Brittany.
To counter a demonstration of the strength of fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their leaders.
The latter promised to be adopted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped to "come up with concrete proposals."
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the General Assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against a sharp rise in diesel prices that peaked at an average of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president will "interpretate with them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better safeguard the conditions of employment and disburse the seafarers."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with firmness.
On Tuesday morning, they performed an operation to "mute-met" (surgery of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing a narrowing of nearly 10km.
The recreational port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections in the direction of Belle-île were not interrupted.
The Quiberon Peninsula has been put into operation by a filtration dam.
The sailors proved their determination as early as Monday, when right at dawn they were burning tires and pallets in front of the proprietary stores of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the l Manche channel, as to the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique area halted the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act before they decided to act, until Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is to decide on Tuesday how to continue the path and its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the state fisheries department, which did not support their movements.
"The strike will continue" as "the fishermen will not drop from nothing" and "want to appear in Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairwoman of the fishing department at Lorient.
Occupational fishermen who do not pay tax on diesel currently pay around 50 cents a litre, but they reckons that the ship's return threshold is only reached when diesel is under €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman spectacular
An unforgettable "Butche Cassidy and Kid" official died in the aftermath of cancer at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clintons, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes all bowed to the film's legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery conditions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies on the delivery of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of recession hovering over the world economy.
The fourth aircraft designer in the world, Embraer, maintains its delivery precaulation for 2008 with 215 devices delivered, confirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer expects a lot from the Chinese market, in particular in mind the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, the Embraer has supplied Chinese clients with 41 devices in the space of eight years.
AIG is said to be considering transferring 15% of its assets
The American International Group, insurer U.S. money authorities, has been pledged to advance more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion it was given as a down payment, reports the Financial Times' Sunday edition.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance policies in the international and pension activities in the United States, the daily, which quotes sources close to the ongoing negotiations, specifies.
The AIG board of directors, according to the FT, met during the evening on Sunday to explore the eventual clash.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmation statement from the AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to get rid of include its aviation leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the insurance policy maker Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and investments in private equity, adds to the FT.
No final decision on these referrals has yet been taken, the FT continues.
AIG must swiftly raise cash in order to repay the $85 billion loan provided by the Federal Reserve Bank with the risk of the US authorities seize 80% of its capital, thereby also diluting to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the Historical Morning Meeting Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to rescue the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of an approaching 800 points, and a Nasdaq of 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The biggest point drop to date in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trade following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the prevailing technology component lost, according to definitive data after the closing of trading, 199.61 points and stabilised at 1,983.73, and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points.
Harvested from the start of the session, Wall Street literally fell short after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan by the House of Representatives, a plan to make it possible to find a little stability in the markets again.
By 228 votes against and 205 for the representatives, they refused to give the Treasury secretary Henry Paulson the means he had asked for.
Nearly two of the three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is the wrong signal to the market that sees that Congress is unable to adopt a plan," says Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not be "too late."
"If this project is actually doomed (...), the relay will be handed over to the Fed (American Central Bank) and other central banks to avert the crisis, which would further strengthen lending conditions," pointed out Brian Bethune, the head economist at Global Insight.
And, with an emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piegza pointed out that in the United States, "every new day brings about the downfall of a financial institution."
After Friday's collapse of Washington Mutual, authorities orchestrated the purchase of the Wachovia Bank's banking activities by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly gained momentum and has required urgent interventions for banks in the UK, in the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are not "only with the US crisis, but with the world crisis," the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen strongly.
Yield from the cash voucher for 10 years fell to 3.632%, up from 3.827% on Friday night, yield to 30 years to 4.161% compared to 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital of MUFG
Banking house Morgan Stanley reported that it enters its centre being entered by the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the largest Japanese bank, which will spend $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after they revealed their preliminary agreement, both banks explained that MUFG intended to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular equities at a single price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the book value of the securities as of 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion in raising convertible securities that will give it a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the entire operation would take place on the basis of an average single prize of $29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock still lost 6.79% and reached $23.07 at around $57,Glick's $5 p.m.
"This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to a banking holding status," explained John Mack, the CEO of the US group.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week, allowing it to diversify its activities, but it also places it under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest ace of Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been amended over the course of the last few days: last Monday, Morgan merely announced that he would sell up to 20% of its shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago we thought," Tošihide Mizuno, MUFG's CEO, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation will consist exclusively of regular shares.
However, in view of the current situation of economics and the market, we wanted to keep the risks to a minimum and also cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% less than their book value for the Morgan Stanley securities.
And the operation will result in a reduction in the profit from the share of about 20%.
The agreement assumes that the MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities to regular equities in a year if the latter are exchanged for a certain period of time at a price of 50% above the exchange price, i.e. at around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by MUFG will allow it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its cash.
However, a spokeswoman for the group declined to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15% of the Tier One's payability ratio, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan clarified that he had "wrongly" downgraded his record since the end of August.
Recent weeks have been challenging for the group, as its stock exchange rate has plummeted by half, while insurance costs against the risk of non-payment of debt-related non-payment have soared.
These costs took the opposite turn on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks, announced after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the buyout Merrill Lynch that it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Refour the republic around the socialism of the XXI century.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
Last Sunday, the third seed put the draft new Constitution to the vote, along the lines of his counterparts and friends.
And his mission is accomplished, as 64% of the electorate, according to the official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, "No" received 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
To be adopted, the draft of the Constitution had to receive half of the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted at the exit from polling stations and the NGO's counted the NGO predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, placing them in the range of 63% to 70%.
Indeed, Rafael Correa demanded to win his draft Constitution during the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution won on the line," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil Governor's headquarters, 280 kilometres southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received a congratulatory note from Chávez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which, according to the observation mission of the Organization of the States of America (OEA), took place peacefully, concerned a text on 444 points building by the "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution affidases the state's power of economics by reserving to it the "planning of the development" of a country living mainly from diesel mining by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The proposal sponsored by Correa, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, which will be able to exercise two consecutive four-year mandates and will be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power to run for a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the Constitution is consolidating the principle of free health and education, which the president began to implement in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit to use the Ecuador base as the starting point of US drug operations.
Obama wins on points in the first televised duel
The first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House was followed by a second debate to find out which of the pair, John McCain and Barack Obama.
The command tents of the Republican and Democrats' campaign were not surprised when both announced their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, as polite as he was, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in the polls.
Gallup's institute, whose poll released Saturday on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% against 44% for McCain), reckons that the Democrat is the one who won the duo.
Among the undecided voters who just matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of respondents, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the supposed good performance of his fellow candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and at the same time the only public debate with his opponent, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's gifted," Bill Clinton nevertheless pointed out over the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain consistently highlighted his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, while also emphasizing the "naivities" of his opponent in the issues that formed the heart of the first encounter.
"It seems that Senator Obama did not understand that..." was the repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge enough to become president," he also assured.
In such an offensive spirit, there have been Republican TV spots since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that it represented the future.
He did not lose his head and proved brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to take the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still misunderstood, while Obama did," the Democratic spot replied over the weekend, accusing the Republican of not taking sufficient account of the impact of the crisis on the "ordinary American."
"During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at the North Carolina election convention in heavy rain.
He did not even utter words like "middle class" or "working." The financial dismantling clearly favours Obama, whom Americans see as more manic alike to save the economy on the sidelines of the chasm.
"There could be a decisive reversal next week," influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to the one Bill Clinton had during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the Democratic nominee, the current scourge is "the final verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy, as practised by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected leaps of Wall Street, he should be able to cut taxes on 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that the implementation of the country's eventual energy independence by promoting renewable energy sources is its number one priority, along with the introduction of the health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, plans to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial aid plan adopted by Congress last night and which is highly unpopular.
"What about you, did you notice any elections being held in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated in the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the polls closed on the main square in Minsk Square to protest the irregularity of the elections to parliament.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: "dictator, resignation."
Some admit that they didn't even go to the polls: "What's the point of doing what they want with my voice anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been warmly towards foreign observers to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to turn democracy towards democracy.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the election is considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count," complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, of a diverse grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," stresses Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "as important is who counts the votes, and with us it is executive power.
If any opposition MPs make it to parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into parliament may mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to take part in the political functioning, because "a dialogue with the European Union is needed.
For if our economy, deeply indebted in Russia, is affected by the crisis and we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has watched the election, not to declare the elections valid.
It stresses that turnout appears to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of the voters in Minsk) opened the way for all sorts of manipulations.
"What about you, did you notice that there were any elections?" asks the social-democratic leader, Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
"There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who are most suited to the regime."
The night's silence was again ploughed by the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on the success.
In Chad, 19 hostages were freed
The Egyptian commando raided the kidnappers of eleven tourists and their eight-man escort who were captured ten days earlier.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides who were held captive in the desert for ten days were fed alive and well on Monday to the Egyptian capital.
During the morning, they were freed by an Egyptian commando squad in Chad.
The hostages arrived at about 3.30 p.m., apparently in good form, aboard a special aircraft to the al-Maza military base, closely adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately taken without a chance to comment in the press, on board the helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, the outskirts of the residential district of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations.
"They are completely healthy" and "the country did not pay any ransom," Egyptian minister, turiz Zohejr Garrana, said on the airport's travel path.
Since his capture on September 19, during a four-wheel-drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hiding place to the other by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard at the Aegyptous Agency's director, the safari organizer.
A senior official in Egypt's security services suggested that 30 Special Forces members who approached the site on board the two helicopters had set off on the line during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shootout, half the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "lighth" unit were sent to Sudan, where they received the support of the German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, mentioned from Belgrade, where he is currently located, a role played by undercover agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result because of the professionalism and efficiency of the people of our secret services, the special forces," he said without further elaboration.
He also denied that the ransom was paid.
On the eve of the evening, the Sudanese army said it had intercepted a four-wheel-drive vehicle on board, killing six, including a Chad commander, and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Movement for the Liberation of Sudan-Union (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The Silent Majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate about the financing of culture fills the pages of the newspaper with headlines and is the theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to denounce the pitiful sums provided by the small museums, the archives, the archaeological digs, and the national sites that are dying of hunger?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that they are negusing their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, do we not have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is dedicating three and a half million euros to the restoration of the mere Chamena of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it says in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organisations, in conjunction.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Society for the History of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, joined by 211 companies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy, to uncover history, preservation of a pile of private archives and the protection of archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often it is these companies that are the watchdogs of our sights that are driven by hopeless protest when promoters and leaders release their bulldozers onto old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see the grandstand for history and sights?
Interview - Blood, which is again certain
Héma-Québec was celebrating the tenth anniversary of its founding yesterday and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, rightly rejoiced, because Héma-Québec became one of the world's most reliable and efficient blood suppliers.
Above all, he has regained the public's confidence that was severely shaken after the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the national reserve of blood administered by the Department of Transfusion of the Canadian Red Cross was contaminated with the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and a wave of public reign, the Canadian government launched a public investigation in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations that such a disaster should not be repeated.
While Judge Krever delayed handing over the report, some of the provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee played out this role.
After the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were set up in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to be farmed by Quebec, and a Canadian bloodstream to supply all the provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec launched his activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was dismal.
By systematically trying to increase the safety of blood products and constant work in this area over the coming years, we have regained public confidence," he says, adding, proudly that in early 2008 Héma-Québek was already trusted by nearly 94% of the québean population.
Dr. Décaryová, however, does not lose sight of "trust is something very fragile."
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the principle of prudence.
"At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease," says the woman who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we had no idea whether this disease could spread through the blood.
We were therefore relying on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which, in the case of not knowing it and when the spread of a serious illness is at stake, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterised by the degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, the precautionary measure must be taken.
In April 1999, we therefore rejected blood from people who have been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that the disease was transmitted through the blood.
This episode has shown us that it made sense to follow the principle of prudence."
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting the HIV virus: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) appeared on the market, allowing the presence of the virus itself to be detected in the donor blood, and not the presence of the antibodies on which the tests were based were used before.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the patient's infection moment and the moment when the first viruses can be detected by our blood techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without even knowing it and without us being able to figure out.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of obtaining AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk of getting blood from HIV contaminated with HIV is now exposed to one person in 12 million.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before anyone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission occurs via a blood product.
I believe that today we can get or prescribe the blood transfusion necessary to heal in complete peace," says the head of Héma-Québek's management.
"The challenge for the next decades is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what a disease-flag element may appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by the stab of insects.
You need to be cautious at all times," Dr. Décaryová and stresses that in addition to the secure supply, Héma-Québec must also reckon with sufficient supply.
"ReOKs are growing because the population is aging.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of the Queens-offic permitted to donate."
Any healthy person at least 18 years old, corresponding to the admissibility criteria, but can only donate blood once every 56 days, that is to say six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not accepted on average because, for example, they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they visited the country where the mud chills are rampant, are excluded for one year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortcomings are very rare.
However, members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, convincing people to give blood is difficult, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unbridled today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored at the Héma-Québek, which also manages the only public bank of blood from the umbilical cord in Québek.
The umbilical cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, abounds in blood-rich stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th sample of blood from the umbilical cord to the bank and we expect to be taking over a thousand a year.
Early next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décary, who describes the blood draw program from the umbilical cord as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Héma-Québec doesn't have the resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all Queek hospitals.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montréal was in the Saputo Stadium yesterday for the second and decisive match of the quarter-final of the total number of goals, he qualified for the semi-final of the USL first-division elimination series, with a 3-1 victory (4-3 to the goal after both of the Seattle Sounders' goalscorer).
Foray, Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a winless first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino netted the remaining two goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday, during the first of two matches of the quarterfinals, the Impact of the quarter-finals at the Starfire Complex in Tukwile, on the outskirts of Seattle, suffered a 2-1 defeat.
Impact will measure his strength in the semifinals with the Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnnesota, the Thunder equalized the deficit in the home game, eventually winning 4-3, but Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals with a 5-4 total goal.
The Impact should face Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of matches will not be confirmed until today.
Briefly - Kovalev's winning goal
The first offensive trio of Canadien is ready to start the season.
A unit consisting of Alex Kovaleve, Tomas Plekanec and Andrey Kosticin at the Centre Bell last night, encouraged a 3-2 attack to win Canaden on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev scored one pass in this fourth consecutive victory in three-tone of the six preseason games.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring only one goal during the stand-alone raids.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian pointed out.
"I need one more game to feel good."
'He tried to do too much in the first period,' Guy Carbonneau observed.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He had a nice applause.'
Charest bets north
The PM does not rule out calling for early elections before the end of the year
Right after the end of the Liberal Party Congress (Parti the Suite), Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Queck, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is running in today's by-election.
"District the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition presented by Jean Charest yesterday in a visually engaging manner at the end of the Liberal Party's convention of Quebecku in Lévis, but without giving details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in a kind of pictorial grinder.
On the three giant canvases, a loop ran with remarkable shots of hydroelectric dams, down, Québek from the perspective of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Generous means, much like in the pre-election period.
Indeed, at the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling for an early election in the fall, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The "Steam of the North" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the prime minister intends for Quebec, a vision of the "new economic space" that includes the Labour Force Agreement with France, the Convention between Canada and Europe and the Ontario Agreement.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the prime minister has recently frequently mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of presentation.
However, the prime minister confined himself to explaining why the North represented "a genre with enormous potential," but he did not give a deadline, investment levels, or a clear priority in future projects.
At most, he mentioned several approaches to points that could be further elaborated: hydroelectric power stations in particular, the forest, but above all, the mining sector, buoyed by the growth of the soaring emerging countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The North, according to Charesto's list, contains "nikl, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
This 'land twice the size of France's ours is with us', 'is in Quebec.
And he's not just with us, he's in us," he pointed out, as if to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the Prime Minister highlighted: the pursuit of gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James's bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after he paused theatrically to view the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Québec has always demanded, the prime minister clarified during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position repeated by all the previous governments.
There is one boundary line that has not existed in a long time for a convention, and if the opportunity arises, in the name of the government, I will re-accept this position," he suggested.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change," he said when he spoke of the Northwest crossing, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that taking the territory is becoming a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be of favoritism, especially for the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pityist MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with about 30 communities.
The work was launched by the Interministerial Committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, and in which Julie Bouletová (Transport and Natural Resources) is in an important position.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a major "not necessarily a summit" but a moment when a common vision is set.
The development of the North should, moreover, take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
Plan the North will be "a co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visa" as a fluent follow-up to the views of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
Indeed, this was one of the still-roasted topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a large cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's ascending party to lead the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rechristen the Beauharnois headquarters as the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Peaceless Revolution and Nationalisation of Water Electricity, to Bourassu, who created the Bay of James, our party was able to shape the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time conservative, on John Diefenbaker's "Roads to the North" program, as prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it was the turn of the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric plant, Charest stressed that it was planned to be launched in 2012.
"I'm just saying it between you and me, but I plan to be there," he told his membership, sparking a lot of applause.
The same prime minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and undoubtedly in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election in the autumn of this year, which is what the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his program was packed, especially with a federal council mission in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress gave the Liberal leader a platform for some nationalist resolutions, especially certain "agency to amend the Constitution," which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Québek Party) particularly demands recognition of the "specificity of Québek" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint a portion of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council, who would have a veto on their vetoes in the event of a decision taken in Québek.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was sceptical about its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Quebecois) Pauline Marois has once again hauled the North Development Society of Quebec, which was launched by Landry's government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced the fulfilment of this policy.
If she were to hold on to it, "we would have moved on today," Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is underway today) Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"However, we wish it was not a mere theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Mario Dumonta, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - The deviated country
It was Vic Toews, the ex-minister of "justice" (O irony) in the Harper's cabinet, who dared to say in the summer of last year that he was a "hanba" for Canada.
This is how to disgrace a woman who has led a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all of our admiration is saying a great deal about the Prime Minister's surroundings and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that is the only one of the Western countries involved who did not take back to the homeland of its national, locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes into account at all that, at the time of the acts he is being accused of having taken place, Omar Khadr was a teenage adolescent.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, is denying its word and leaving it to rot in the inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty international, and the Canadian Attorney's Association in particular, are advocating the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to see a fair trial in Canada.
The same government turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little about the fact that this young man is now psychologically destroyed, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torment.
We don't realize that, but we are just witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," the words Harper is flagging so much, and which sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come for no longer to exist of morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to treat him ill, to imprison him at the arbitrariness of the head of the hitherto minority government (as will be the case after the 14th time. October...).
Many voters believe they will find rescue in the party that proclaims the Virtue, the Law, and the Order: they do not see that this government has renceded what created the reputation and esteem of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, is in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discupue
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian Mining Company Barrick Gold.
With orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched the prosecution of three authors and a poor libel publishing house to incite a "transparent public debate" and is demanding six million of them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for libel, but by law.
Not surprisingly, Garver is completely owing to this crucial distinction.
Or is it for Barrick Gold to bring to ruin anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the process turns out to be, the author and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a highly unbalanced fight with an army of attorneys supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, the tactics in these outstanding struggles often consist of ruining the defendants in order to enforce conciliation proceedings that will be fentling the opposing party and, moreover, afterdoing anyone who dared to pursue the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view to the whole thing.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate under normal circumstances consists in an exchange of ideas, rather than in baton blows.
Mining companies were therefore not enough to open their books, their documentation, and to establish a real debate through a newspaper, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could shed light on the matter.
However, Barrick Gold does not seem to have any confidence in public opinion and rejects petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a "public debate" while despising the views of the same public?
This word in the vice-president's world seems to refer to only bold-paying attorneys, and not all Canadians; that is a rather narrowed concept.
In a democracy, even the lizigers have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and consider the matter, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant's mouth is to be clogged (in the framework of their prosecution of the "public debate" Barrick, by the way, has just given an official call to the authors of Noir Canada to officially inform them that they should stop using this term...).
Aside from the surreal speech of Garver, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom of research and the search for the truth that is essential for any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote trusted sources and to the debate about the facts and interpretations that itself underpin the basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that the rich firms of this world do not like without being subjected to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have been created if it had followed the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's overreacting clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it has no appetite for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to introduce measures to limit such a type of unjustified prosecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Understand
Yesterday, the Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the biggest economic bailout plan since the Great Crisis of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use US$700 billion to hinder the financial crisis that has been clouding Wall Street for months must still be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of its chosen representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money imposed, new arrangements for capturing the number of houses seized for non-perishable, as well as the right to monitor the level of wages paid to leading workers of rescued firms.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, following the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and come to an agreement that is effective in the markets," said Bush administration official, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to make the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the crisis currently taking place on Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"That's a crucial point: if we don't do it, the trauma, the chaos, and disruption of the Americans' daily lives will be enormous," said Jad Gregg, a Republican.
Over the past few hours, the negotiations have started to at maximum speed out of fear of the effect of further failure on investor state of mind.
The designated time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two US presidential candidates were invited to the negotiations later, and both were more likely to comment on the deal, but without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited the addition of an agreement on some of the measures, in particular the aim of which is to allow the owners of their residence to remain, and the wage measures for leading labor-ordered state-rescued firms.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate themselves on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on the TV's waves.
His Republican rival, John McCain, who was questioned by another station as to whether to vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The coarse features I have read [show] that it is something that we will all have to digest and use to move on.
Choosing inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The $700bn plan aims to buy back doubtful claims and risky and non-negative assets of US financial institutions with taxpayer money.
The plan comes after a 14-month crisis sparked by the bursting of the housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in a cash freeze and the decomposition of banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of the first draft agreement last week is due to Republican MPs.
Ever since the Democrats agreed to the government's guarantee for some of the "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty, but not to buy them, there is a belief that the impasse is averted.
In an effort to approximate conflicting views in Congress, a measure has been added to the government that will be able to introduce new fees to help it get its deposit back if, as a result of the program, it has to take losses for five years.
The new plan envisages a first amount of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The deposit of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will acquire stakes in rescued firms that will pay dividends to it in the event of a profit and which it will be able to resell when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay seizure property logging procedures for the loans covered by the plan, as well as setting limits on the level of valuations and compensation paid to the executives of the affected firms.
The plan's architects would like to vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain that their plan will be green.
Yesterday, the vote in both the Republican and Democratic camp continued to rise against the project.
"It's very obvious that Washington can't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Commission.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But earning money in the taxpayers is not the solution."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen nicknamed the "Skeptics' Enforcement Committee," presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"The four hundred esteemed economics professors, among them the three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too much and to examine carefully which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis was a world crisis.
Following the end of the emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced a partial nationalisation of Fortis, the banking group, for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from buying its competitor, which is on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) as a result of a crisis in risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, ranks among Europe's top 20 banks and among the top ten insurers.
"We will not lose this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we get the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that's what savers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times."
On the other side of the Channel, the British government, meanwhile, appears to have begun to nationalise another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing Bradford and Bringley loans, of which more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) were loans to buy real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy out the branches and accounts of the British bank's clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government must nationalise since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - The Death of a Socially Engaged icon
His beauty, with his azure eyes, had long been his trump card, according to others, a weakness.
Has this American actor discharged himself with a charming rejoinder of narcissism?
Yes, no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and relentless talent inherent in him also distreated him from the force category that breeds real stars.
However, what a long shot he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83, at his Ranchings in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer, and remains one of the last icons of the healing years of American cinema.
Less spectacular than Brando, who was similar and for a long time, was a rival to his film screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly a more fragile but also an apostle of freedom and the disintegration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often breeds beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
These European roots were born one of the famous faces of the American dream.
Without an exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Having seen the whole country in love with self-formed mana, a fighter in the Pacific War, injured in a battle who studied acting at Yale in the early 1950s, then attended New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated a triumph in the theater, television and soon in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a racing driver who placed second at the 24-hour race at Le Mans in 1979, and a sexual symbol, despite the fact that he had been a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, the shaded spots of this hidden, discreet, socially committed stars also leave, allergic to the fuss of their own show-business, which will always remain mysterious to some extent.
A decent man, in the noblest of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has given dizziness to film lovers, while his big roles compete with each other on the black screen of memories.
After it, it is marred by a century of ever-changing American's seventh art.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who revisits his voluptuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in the Cat on a Hot Roof, a 1958 adaptation of Tennessee Williams.
From the less distant past (1990), we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by marriage that has not lived up to all expectations.
So many of the other Pauls of Newman went down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a mad, violent, unforgettable delinder, unforgettable delinquent from the Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role for James Dean, taken in after his death, which made Newman's acquaintance in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely brilliant The Sting (Sunit), the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
The bitter and vengeful billuster player in Robert Rossen's astonishing The Hustler (1961), portraying the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which will bring him the only Oscar in 1987 out of seven nominations.
This face traveling for ages, that was him.
And him again.
In his career, different epochs compete.
He is known to the young thanks to George Roy Hill's iconic Slap Shot (1977), from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans reunited with him in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy Brothers Coen.
He then tied his career as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes in 2003.
Unlike several film legends that left the trade quite early on, Newman stayed in the business for a long time, though he denounced Hollywood with his appetites, ostentatious, and concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not humorless, regarded him "as a live challenge of underplaying," judging that he pushed too hard in his performances.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a doorm, the profession was not always as gentle.
But he played first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotic, alcoholics, crooks, and desperate people whose declines and rebellions reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed the little-known pages of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife, Joanne Woodward, is given a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
To his son, Scott, who he lost due to an overdose, dedicated to Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness in 1984.
In the flurry of honours Newman received yesterday, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said saddened: "His presence made my life and the country better."
The magnanimity, the love of life, such are the main qualities of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, the great champion of civil rights, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of the decline of Hollywood is also leaving.
We used to seeing his likeness on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which we might have found rather tasteless, though it was a gag at first.
However, the proceeds from the sale went to his Hard Childhood Foundation.
Newman was thus, rather than lulled in by fame, until the last moment he was involved in society.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing the following sentences: "Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to have been here."
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the career of a life as a prescient and magnanimous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Co. invoice factory?
Soon, 8. October, the trial will begin in the criminal proceedings against Jánosi Zuschlag and his associates.
The politician and his associates are charged, among other crimes, including the forgery of documents, of fraud committed in a long-term and systematically criminal organisation, as a result of which the extremely significant damage was caused.
According to the prosecution, they used the money received in public tenders for their own purposes and often evidenced the performance of the tasks with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and municipalities - a total of approximately 65 million forints - went partly to the coffers of Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method, which was also reported by the Investigating Bureau, was that the money received in the public tenders had been levied on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration, and never fell short of the association's commitments.
According to the indictment, a large portion of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices came from the Józsefváros market, the round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names in which companies are to be made of invoices were decided, among other things, on a round trip along the northern bank of Balaton, to which István Lados János Zuschlag was sent.
According to his testimony, the former was to look for guesthouses and restaurants.
In them, he applied for the bills for his consumption, according to the modeling of which the invoices submitted in the context of the public tenders announced by, among others, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Samoospráve of the capital, were then produced.
The invoices were mostly exhibited by István Lados with his partner András se Őrim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain the subsidies.
On his "studio tour," Lados spotted a beer hall.
According to the two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this hospitality establishment provided catering for a 90-member group from the Biztos Pont association.
So many people, however, according to the company manager's claims, would not suddenly fit into this facility.
Similarly, the invoice issued by the summer of 2002 to the foundator entitled Jobb Jövőért, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért were swarmed with formal and content errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomai had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet a hundred and thirty guests were shown on the invoice.
However, the fillers of the form of a rich fantasy made the case even when they referred to the documents of the company also devoted to the hospitality company - Pigal s. r. o., in the accounts of which, according to the information provided to the prosecutor's office, the documents in the name Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá did not even be included.
The head of the firm, Győző Farkas, said that when he was summoned to the prosecution and presented with invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our business and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place."
As he added, apart from the formalities, they did not agree to accommodate a hundred people, as they had only eleven rooms that did not have the capacity to do so.
In addition, the invoice also included catering, while their restaurant has not been operating for a long time.
The outrageous invoice manufacturers were not convinced that the sought-after Budapest travel agency only organizes overseas trips, and the invoice with the cash payment, which was also not agreed with the company's invoice practice, they said foolishly as a service to arrange a trip to Hungary.
In addition, as the investigation revealed in the course of the investigation, they also stated in the document VAT, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was released from VAT.
On the four documents on display at the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. disagreed, among other things, the amount of VAT. The activities of the firm are not covered by the 25 percent VAT mentioned, but by 15 per cent VAT, in addition, the hotel's staff issued only printed invoices, but the invoice produced was written in hand.
In addition, they spoiled the "publishers" of an invoice by mentioning at one firm, as revealed by the prosecution's investigation, such as the road transport of goods carried out, which the company founding initially on investment advice.
That the invoices are issued to the Egyptütt and Harmadik Évezredért and the XXI associations. The Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont false, was also baffled because of formal deviations - the inadequate format of the invoice and the false stamp.
As with Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose officials denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the forgeries did not even notice that HIB s.r.o. from Nyíregyházy was in liquidation at the time (2001), when the group from the Fiatal Városért association was eating at it, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he had issued the paper.
Invoices were subjected consciously
The second group of invoices are those who knew to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation issued the bills for about four million forints for Harmadik Évezredért at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The head of the Collab s. r. o. company was prompted, according to the indictment, by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi to issue a fictitious account.
Zuschlag and his associates also cooperated with Biogate s. r. o. currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő with invoices worth some five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Nor the movement of the money, because the invoices created were later canceled, which the organizations have forgotten to put in their documents.
Another group of invoicing firms includes those with ties to the defendants.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov was the commissioned representative of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trio s. r. o., a fuel trading company and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but on which the company is not to be found.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of IT worth approximately 18 million forints in October, November and December 2005.
According to the data found by the investigation, the Kiskunhalasas company Cash Investment s. r. o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The company's manager was a man from Romania, to whom Iván Kubatov was to hand over the company's documents in 2002-2005.
As we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that he had issued invoices to the Atlasz, Hoppá and the Foundation of Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért on behalf of the company and himself accepted their consideration.
In written at the request of Iván Kubatov, the companies of the Romanian bricklayers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, neither of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Yet the businesses were of favor, as he issued invoices to At the request of co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who had also prepared their founding charters, invoices to Atlasz and Y-Generáció linked to Zuschlag.
On behalf of the firms Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave the organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The prosecutor's office decided that Kubatov had come in at 10 percent of the sums on the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for a tender for the Biztos Pont Association, the man also used Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, the Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarország.égért made the M'austrike Foundation's Masters Táncscs (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500,000 forinte each, but did not spend the sums on the targets set out in the proposals.
To make it out, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found during a search of the home in the office of Árpad Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants are likely to describe the course of invoices production, as she has already done in the prosecution.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal everything.
His testimony to date is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will set out everything at length, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether this is in his interest - in exchange for paying for a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the Socialists have made a deal with him, and Zus will take the blame.
Indeed, he could have been offended so far, as his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, namely to be placed under house arrest, remained unheard.
While offenders who have done much more damage that they have not yet paid for are free to walk or at least wait for the end of their trial in their homes to be conducted, he does not have that option.
The psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been uncovered by researchers in the field of neurology and economics at the University of New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to lag behind in the eBay auction competition, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
The research was used by an experimental auction to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers grated, the other group participated in a staged auction, with the active areas of the brain of the test subjects being investigated using the functional magnetic resonance imaging method.
In both games, the participants could have won the money, but in the game at the auction, an important element of which is to outmanecele, the whole found under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, began to work intensively in the loss.
This cerebrospheft region plays a role in the "self-referral" mechanism of the nervous system, among many other functions.
The unscrewing of the price is therefore, according to the researchers, to be explained by trying to avoid the stride reaction of the striata.
To shore up their theory, members of the economists' research team conducted a financial cross-sectional investigation.
In it, under different conditions, three groups were quoted against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, members of the group were promised that if they emerged victorious, they would receive an extra $15 as a reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss its members lost that money as well.
The difference between the two groups was therefore all about one being emphasised by a win and another by losing.
The members of the group playing "anti-protest" were, however, willing to go higher than they were in the control and "victorious" group, which confirms the neurologists' hypothesis.
"These results cannot be deduced from any pre-existing economic theory.
For these, until now, they have explained the phenomena observable at auctions with the joys of victory and the avoidance of risk.
It was the neurological imaging methods that helped us resolve the contradiction between these two theories in such a way that we have now come to a third explanation," stated Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of Economics at the University of New York University.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, while in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only 7,000 of them are being treated. The cause of this is that the sick often do not know they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the poo to formulate the name of infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, the liver and jaundice inflammation are characterised, but the agents of the disease and the diseases they cause for each other differ from each other.
Hepatitis virus is spreading in two main ways depending on the cause of the disease: hepatitis A and E of the digestive system (for example, by infected foods, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses of blood and bodily fluids (sperma, theatrial secretions, spiches).
In any case, travellers should be protected by vaccinating A and B, and there is no vaccine against the C virus.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after taking the infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, urges to vomit.
Then, on the skin and the whites of the eyes, the egg yolk forms, the lightened stool and darkens the urine. The treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, a million people die worldwide from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that an estimated one in ten of the infected is treated with medication.
hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the infected are not even aware of their illness, the agents of the disease are destroying liver cells insidiously, and so the first symptoms do not come in many cases until 20-30 years.
That is why early prevention, the conduct of regular depotism, is very important.
In three groups, the disease occurs a lot more often than on average: among people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
Currently, the projected global number of individuals infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
As the disease can already be shown by a routine laboratory examination, the person should contact his or her general practitioner if he or she notars any sign of unknown origin.
When detected early, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the organism to prevent contagion and prevent cancer.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, which was organised by the organisations representing the sick for the world for the first time in 2004.
It aims to draw attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by these viruses, the causes of its occurrence and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Benelux Governments to be nationalised by Fortis Bank
The Benelux states will be helped by the Belgian-Dutch bank, Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble because of the spreading effect of the US mortgage market crisis, by partial nationalisation: the three countries will support a €11.2 billion in the money and insurance facility, which also has a capital participation in Hungary.
This was agreed at the highest level by the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Fortis is the first in the euro area to be in a major crisis in the wake of the international financial markets, spreading in the waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken in this matter could be considered as precedents from a certain point of view.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy up nearly half (49 per cent) of the bank's assets.
The bank will sell part of its capital holdings with absolute certainty, especially the insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Fortis shares began to plummet with the institute falling last week, with serious signs of crisis already appearing at the institute in the second half of the week.
But analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company's securities fell by 12 percent on Friday alone, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the group's current share prices, the group's total market share capital is around €14 billion, but this is unrealistic, according to the company's leaders.
Indeed, the company's management blames the collapse of Fortis's shares in overseas market uncertainty surrounding the adoption of a $700 billion US package plan.
By Monday, the stock had risen slightly.
On Friday, the new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed to head the bank.
The cash institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has yet come forward with a more serious offer.
The Belgian government had previously announced that investors did not have to worry, they would not lose their money.
Panic has not yet broken out among the bank's clients and the branches have not been taken by an attack.
In Hungary, Fortis Bank has a separate branch and has also bought up several leasing firms.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic that could make death easier for Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining the way in a person's belief in the heart of pain is influenced, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, they subjected 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists to electric shocks, while all of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic faithful were able to rule out much of the pain.
The technique closely investigating the human brain has also shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The research is the first of a series of research, which is attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university, alongside academics.
The test was exactly so that they attached a sparkling tool to the test subject's left hand, which was making electric shocks.
Researchers asked the participants of the experiment to stare at two paintings: the 17th-century Sassoferrat Virgin Mary and the Lady with the Pord of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain state of piety among the faithful, while da Vinci's painting was chosen because it was not very different from the first and appearing to them to be reassuring.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electroshock parts in four consecutive parts, while separately following a religious or general image.
The Catholics reported that the sight of the Virgin made them feel "safe" "safe" at the sight of the Virgin, as if they had been "tainted" and "reassured, peace fulfilled."
Watching the religious-themed image, they felt 12 percent less pain than they did when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also took part in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved by any strongly impressive image even in atheists, only the right photograph must be found.
"We would have to find an image that they will perceive very positively, from the position of the mother or father," the psychologist said.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Preachicting of faith should change and in many cases will change our personality as well," Wright added.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would be to regulate the pain of the faithful if they showed them a Madonna by Leonardo or a similar-caliber painter.
Would the view of the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You're what you're gonna share
On his tenth birthday, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as they can in the sky overhead; they know where they were on vacation, what expert examinations they attend and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's chief executives, that's still not enough.
However, as far as the skeptics make a parallel with the Orwellian dark vision, they are not exactly clear at the very essence of the site 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently commented to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary to enable Google's founders to stick to their original intention, which was, "Let's keep all the information in the world!"
According to the interviewed Google official, the company, even after ten years of world-flag work, is only at the beginning to work with all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years' time, Schmidt said he would like to see Google's answering questions like "what am I supposed to do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would be appropriate for me?" - but those seemingly simple questions, of course, the software won't be able to answer until they know enough about users.
Not all internet users know well that during the internet search, the searched words are accurately captured from what IP address they were searched for and to which pages the candidates moved after the search.
With Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep their surfing history, can watch back what they were looking for and what they click on, which then generates findings adapted much more directly to them in the long run - the same logic will be based on the service, through which the system will be offered products and services based on previously stated and retained preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm dealing with? - asks users who are afraid to look at Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is more threatening, with the anti-reaction not provoking a guilt in the Internet's users, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or even a rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the searched terms are not only captured, but can also be issued to a third party in justified cases, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users are not protected.
The most well-known recent example was perhaps coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google gave the Brazilian government information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community site, set up through it.
But online users who worry about personality rights could still be relieved in May when the firm, hand-in-hand with the EFF's e- Rights Conservation Organization, successfully proved its truth in the FBI's dispute: so Google mustn't be forced to provide any of the Constitution's secretly requested information to the FBI in the future.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought for nearly fifty thousand web addresses and a thousand searched terms, which it obtained, citing the reinforcement of the years-long Child Protection Act, but still failing to get the lists of wanted items for individual users, or the full lists of websites and keywords, including a period of two months.)
The view of Google is thus rather contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear to provide their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be harmed by starting to use Google's services, and oppose it with the revolt of the role of multinational firms with a conservative image.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild offshoot, grouping around enthusiastic computer fans, activists, and users, appearing in many countries, see it as a new generation of big business, "corporation, what's now trending," unlike his rival Microsoft, considered the world's conqueror of Windows, however they both fight for the same goals.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want them to use the money for its applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information, and a package of programs feels much more affordable, more youthful, "cool" than the practice of an official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks understand exactly the very problematic relationship of the Internet and the personality rights that has brought with it one of the most swollen keywords of recent years: the website 2.0.
Indeed, the Web 2.0 is about nothing more than a collaboration, about deliberately keeping tracks behind and using the communication channels at our disposal, and although their range is different for each, the essence remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can keep a profile on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which they can easily link to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording the music hearsed music, all of which he can then connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to which he can automatically write a blog on which his latest photo gallery, which saves on Flickr or Picas.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of specimen cases from which he comes to light: a friend, looking at the floods of pictures of their friends in the morning, it easily comes to the point with who her shackled boyfriend spent the evening with, or the company can fire his worker just because he recounts his sincere opinion on his blog of the senior management: one thing is certain, the notion of private life has been completely reassessed today.
The one who lives life is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to conceal something, or at least avoid a google monopoly, has the option (starting with Scroogle, for example, using Google's search system, but deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, a small number of people are not deliberately registered on the community site so that they cannot be found. Google's online apps from the text editor to the photo editor and the news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to the giant server parks and which do not form the highest quality profile possible.
Public opinion is not very secretly awaiting when Google will show the teeth.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca Cola ($110 billion), advertising space AdWords/AdSense is threatened by investment by advertising agencies, and services being implemented at an ever-accelerating pace are making life seriously more difficult for, not just for Microsoft, but also by numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, find counterpoints that look unsettling: for example, the senior management has completely rejected workers' protests after it has double the fee for the company nursery, the arbitrarily frequent daily catering of employees, according to the company's management, all of which is lost in addition to the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and filters out any find that contrary to the good taste or interests of the Chinese regime, or the interests of the Chinese regime, in the sense of their agreement.
One of the company's internal rules is that it will never advertise new services in advance, only when they can be used, but what is certain is that the expected problems of the coming months and years may be chewing the world in new places: while some believe that Google's project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such proportions that the company will soon be dealing with the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of its Health system, in which we can build a complete medical profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good source material for subsequent generations of sci-fi writers, the famous novel by Cory Doctorow "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences the future, in which one can be harmed with a deterrent just using Google data.
The two-time assassin from the OW was helped to remove the tracks of two teenagers
Two juveniles were interviewed by the police in the case of the double murder in the Ózdu, according to reasonable suspicions of suspicion, they helped with the removal of the traces of this crime, a spokesman for the High Police Headquarters Directorate Borsod said on Tuesday.
Persons have pleaded guilty to the activities of the suspected possession and are currently charged with aiding and abetting a crime.
The two teenagers, two girls, according to MTI's information, are being prosecuted at large.
The rescue of the crime is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder in Ózdu, a 23-year-old man here, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of the crime of pre-planned multiple murders for self-interested reasons.
During the investigation, it emerged that the 23-year-old young man owed the 53-year-old man a larger sum.
The suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a one of the establishments in ÓW last Wednesday, where he killed first a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI information, the young man was deprived in advance about the crime, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder by a gun hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are examined by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange makes offer to buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a 100% chunk of shares in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the range of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15, the offer of Poles is the highest amount offered to the bidder for the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech newspaper, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted a bid.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, commented last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of any bidders, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by experts in stock markets at 5-10 billion.
Under the shareholders' agreement, around 90 per cent of the shares could be sold off.
The biggest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with an approximately 25 percent share, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r. a.l. with 13.5 percent.
The Financial Crisis in the perspective of the European papers
In their comments on Tuesday about the deepening international financial crisis, Europe's leading papers are already reminiscent of "a second of 9/11.
For the global financial disaster, we can thank the American president, the accusations are being made by Rome's La Repubblica. The President was not even able to rally his own party in support of that hastily sprawled bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, who was reminiscent of the billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we might be talking about the second 9/11.
He also sees the culprit in Washington in Madrid.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the world economy has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse its lack of political leadership.
The danger of collapsing the collapse of the US financial system continues to grow, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington would not offer a political tool for a solution to the crisis.
The world economy is in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is underway.
The threat can no longer be ignored, the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper of Geneva points out.
Individual states can still throw a lifesaving force into the reigning financial institutions, and taxpayers can save them from crashing.
But if other banks collapse like the dominoes, then neither the funds nor other improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move through their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the post-ending financial institutions received more than €100 billion, recalls Vienna's Der Standard, in Vienna, saying that fears that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to dig deep into their pockets in depth for the crisis are increasingly real.
The European Union has not yet seriously addressed the crisis, which is being rolled out like a tsunami by the old continent.
"Paramedics" do not have to immediately wave hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be a good idea if they set a firm setting, in which case it is prudent to reach for taxpayers' money to prevent even more damage.
An intelligent car imitates the bumblebee's flight
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collision, if not imitations of obstacle detectors occurring in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
The initial strategic idea of a surprise project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC trade fair, was given to Nissan engineers by bumblebees. It was about building a new generation of precipitation systems.
In collaboration with the Tokyo University, Nissan has designed a biomimetic robotic robotic control system of the BR323C type, a robotized minicar that is equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective cover," explained Kazuhiro Doi, CEO of the brand for technology PR and R&D, at the exhibition.
Composed eyes play an important role, allowing bees to be seen in all directions at the field of view of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eye, the engineers reached for the idea of a laser range.
This identifies the obstacles up to 2 metres before the BR23C in the field of view of 180 degrees, calculate their distance and sends an on-board microprocessor a signal that immediately transforms into an operation to prevent the collision.
The barrier is caught in a split second, then begins to imitate the bee's movements and by turning the wheels to the extent needed to prevent the collision immediately change direction.
Unlike any existing system, this swipe maneuver takes place in an absolutely instinctive way.
"If that were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Robotic Car Project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology suits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of safety protective cover, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The process must be reflected in what the bee is doing to avoid the other bees.
This process must not take longer than blink an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction that can be turned on the wheels.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to the bees when avoiding, in the case of a robotic car, only the possibility of rotating movement, acceleration and slowing was applied.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than the lithium-ion variants.
According to Ando, the instinctive, intelligent response, not the ability to process, are important, and much less data storage.
This mechanism must only be processed and responded to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need for him to keep them and respond using an intuitive logic based on the data from previous maneuvers, so he is constantly using only a memory the size of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing the technology used to immediately avoid, which Nissan estimates could reach mass-produced cars within a decade.
Another possibility of application may be a connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding the obstacles in the way of the obstacles, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
The curtly expensive child already has a name
The $700 billion, the $700 billion Rescue Economy Package Act, to be divided into several instalments to buy back bank shodlet loans, is already in writing.
In the first round, half of the amount will be used.
After further negotiations, which ended after midnight on Saturday, US Eastern Time, Congressional officials reached an agreement in a days-long debate on a rescue package worth a total of $700 billion, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, under which only the deal is drafted.
The package's compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said of the compromise result: "The programme will work and will be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was released before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington's time (at 2 a.m. Central European Time on Monday), but did not cause any special rise in the stock exchanges.
The draft legal standard, hearing in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act of 2008, which is to be established by the program, will be voted first by the House of Representatives on Monday, then the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, after which news of the deal was also welcomed to the White House.
"We are satisfied with the progress made at night, and we are very much appreciative of the efforts of both parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
Indeed, the program differs from the Bush administration's original proposal, which was supposed to make a total of $700 billion spent on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities.
It is now possible to spend a maximum of half of 700 billion in the first around the first, so that the $250 billion will be used immediately after the matter is expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Treasury Department buys for them the mortgage-backed securities, which are rated as of poor quality, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be inspected by a special body, which will also be a member of the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on Congress's next decision.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy back poor quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "easy" loans.
The buyout can take place both in the auctions and directly, the ministry's competent representatives said.
The legal standard will allow the firms concerned to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Treasury will provide them with a guarantee for funds presenting cause for concern, for which it will then pay the company a price corresponding to the amount of the expected damage.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary resources to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system, whether it be a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or preventing the systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major financial institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to implement the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, bank executives who have run into trouble and are waiting for the state's help can count on the government to lower their severance package - which is simply called a "golden parachute" in overseas slang.
Their payouts will be reduced only in certain cases, in addition to these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction essentially means that if the Ministry buys as part of the auction, the golden parachutes will be subject to a tax surcharge if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the event of a direct redemption of poor-quality loans, the government will act aggressively in order to ensure that the money for the management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the restriction only applies to new contracts, which is to be a further stimulus to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history to have a statutory cap on the remuneration of CEOs," commented the provision to the chairman of the Financial Services Committee of the House of Representatives, a Democrat, Barney Frank.
In addition, the state will have a right to acquire a stake in the banks participating in the scheme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as once the economy and the bank rescued with it, they can also profit from that transaction.
The draft plan includes that in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal to determine how the taxpayer's expected financial-sector losses can be returned.
There were, of course, voices on both sides expressing doubts about the plan.
"This is not what the American citizens asked us to do, because this is not what the taxpayer's dollars will protect," said California Republican congressman Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, reckons that the adoption of the provision was urged by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 due to the previous month, compared to August 2007 by 12.9 percent, the Central Bureau of Statistics reported.
The export sales prices in the industry were up 1.1 percent compared to July 2008, down 3.9 percent year-on-year.
As the cause of changes in domestic and export prices, production prices were up 0.7 percent compared to the previous month, up 3.2 percent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry rose only minimally, by 0.1 percent, given the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also increased slightly compared to July, by 0.1 percent.
The biggest price increase was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear sectors (2.8 per cent), mainly due to month-on-month price increases in the meat and saddlery products sector by 4.6 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, of shoe production.
Higher price levels for plastic and chemical raw materials have caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the production of chemical materials and products (1.6 percent).
The price cuts were in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electric machines and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - at a minimal rate - the woodworking sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in the field of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water distribution sector, which is of great weight in domestic industry sales, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the ongoing impact of the officially established gas price increase from 1. July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices rose the most in the specialist oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking production sector, it was possible to observe 13.2 per cent, in the area of the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight gain, then an 11 per cent price increase.
The price cuts were in the textile and textile product production sectors (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry rose by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water distribution sectors surpassed prices from the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of division by sector focus, domestic sales were subject to the highest monthly price increase (0.7 percent) in the domestic sales in the industry involved producing tangible assets.
In the consumer goods industries, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, in energy-producing and further-refiguring sectors, prices have not changed due to the previous month.
The biggest price increases given the same month of the year in August 2008 could be seen in the energy of the processing and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods industries, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, while for tangible assets weighed a 1.4 percent price drop.
Export sales prices of industrial products as measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, down 3.9 percent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency weakened by 1.7 percent in one month due to the euro, then 7.1 percent relative to the euro, up 7.5 percent relative to the euro compared to August 2007 and 15.9 percent relative to the dollar.
Next year no visa to the United States?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is a great hope that the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force around January 12, with the Minister of Foreign Affairs talking about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "now almost everything matters if an electronic system of permitting journeys and checks, or checks, is built up in time overseas."
At the same time, she pointed out that there would be no entry permit as part of the new system, but tourists would have to register before they leave.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy is continuing negotiations in Washington today.
He will meet with Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the Order of Merit to the Hungarian Republic and conduct interviews with foreign policy advisers for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are all in favour of a bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major US parties, agreed to secure the $700 billion bail-outs government package for their support on Sunday, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
After a marathon of several days of negotiating Congress and administration officials, it was announced early on Sunday morning: a basic agreement was reached on a package to rescue the banks.
The financial package, which aims to translate the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are consistently calling themselves more suitable from both candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, at the same time as economic issues came to the fore, Obama won some advantage again, and McCain's lead, which he secured for the vice-presidency after the Republican convention, has been vacant with Sarah Palin's nomination.
Obama expressed hope at a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly adopted by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contained passages on consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) to your places, your jobs, the whole industry, the stability of the whole economy, the stability of the whole economy there is a danger," he said ahead of the 35,000-strong crowd.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain's ideas about the economy outdated.
In an interview given to the ABC television station, McCain said: "It will abhor all a bit (...) but doing nothing just isn't possible the way to go."
As the Republican senator said, the draft features the establishment of a commission by the Supervisory Secretary to the Treasury Secretary and the cut-offs for the top officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a more substantial role in the negotiations, but he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi told the announcement on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill perhaps as early as Monday.
List of printing of the German language
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident - so it analyses the weak CSU result in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the Red and Black and Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article "The Prague Revolution Erifels His Fathers" the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began a long time before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over its office.
For decades, the Christian Socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria - and it is these modern citizens who are turning away from them.
Meanwhile, the alternation of the period is a problem for all of Christian democracy, and thus to Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process ended, which could be assumed for almost exactly ten years: the indisputable hegemony of one of the statesmen's end.
Already a decade ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, below the 50 percent threshold for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005, the so often mentioned period of Stoiber.
The cause is the modernisation that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country, which is devouring to its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong at pace. But the secularization, the results of education, the resettlement of Germans from the east and the north in the emerging regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequence of the loyalty of the CSU voters.
The modernisation is linked to the growth of possibilities, which also has its visible political implications.
The right-wing camp is intact, with only the voters inside it becoming more confident, more critical, more reigning.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has moved the most from the classical civic classes; the people of the liberal profession, the tradesmen, the graduates, and the university's education.
This has already shrugged the CSU's support to below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna Journal, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The party leaders are reticent on the coalition's issues," devotes the confusing domestic political situation to the result of the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP forbids the SPÖ's interference in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ appears open to all negotiations, the Greens do not yet want to negotiate a coalition.
The election is over, now it's all about the Coalition; in a debate held on public television, party chairmen didn't give each other much insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wished to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some Länder and in social partnership it exists.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor, was left open to Faymann.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was outvoted at any rate.
Repeating this direction is not an option.
Molterer responded to the red bids with caution.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider appeared again open in all directions.
"To prevent a red and black coalition, we are ready to take on the government's responsibility," said Haider.
Járóková: A vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Equality Summit hosted by France, the current European Union-leading State, has begun in Paris today.
As one of the main speakers of the professional deliberation, Lívia Járóková, a member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, turned her attention to segregation in education in her message to the plenary, as she is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, as well as the most serious obstacle to their application.
He opened the summit - on behalf of the French Presidency - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimír Špidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
For the deliberations, they sat among the invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights protection organisations and civil associations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Járóková group of MEPs, Járóková pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of the workforce, the Roma are forced out of the European labour market primarily through their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, as a result of poor quality primary education, only a tiny proportion of them can achieve a higher level of education."
Járóková further stressed that education as a basic human right has a key role to play in the application of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MP, it is necessary to confirm the consciousness of these connections in the broadest circles - among both Roma and non-Romani children.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma student starts a school, the better chance of becoming a productive member of the labour force market; through income and excise taxes, they contribute to the national budget.
"Romani people are the right to have their citizenship of the European Union need to ensure the right to a quality education and to guarantee the removal of their poor quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the MEP, the European Union's cohesion, with an emphasis on the aim and the negotiations, in order to immediately speed up the processes of the desegregation of schools, which is of paramount importance for this is the right to uphold the current and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be breached, it is necessary to give Romani children the possibilities given by the democratic space in order to participate as full-bodied citizens in the future of Europe," Járóková said.
Everyone is guaranteed, as a 'European Year of Equal Opportunities', the European Equality Summit's objective, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to achieve the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set at the level of both Europe and individual Member States.
Fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in America, based on people's drug purchase data, often dismiss the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with a candidate.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become out of controllable.
'There is a data protection programme linking the use of the prescribing data in any case to the permission of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone independent, otherwise we entrust the hen to the fox," the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, the author of the program designed to monitor the prescribing of drugs.
Insurance companies make premiums and amounts paid in the event of claims dependent on the health of candidates, and if the risk is assessed as too large, the insurance will not even be concluded with it.
Previously, they sent in the person to medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick devised a much cheaper course of action: based on the identification number, the customer from the pharmacy easily discovers what drugs the subject has bought in the past year and a half, from which he or she deduces the program, what his illnesses are and his health.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-reduction drugs, this refers to the fact that he has a virtually uncontrollable high blood fat level, which immediately categorizes him in the higher-risk category.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some determining the risk coefficient at the same time, so the insurance company is almost left with no work except for paperwork, although minor difficulties arise.
The drawbacks is that many medicines can be used for several purposes, some compounds are for example usable against migraine or hot flush, but are also effective against depression.
These pose, from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, a significant risk-enhancing factor, whereas the former's problems are not.
Special companies have been created for the purpose of requesting and processing the data and before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies have been provided with permission for the patient.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their negligence to date.
Some companies have recently also been processing the results of laboratory examinations that they associate with data on the drugs used, which allows them to provide an even more accurate picture of the patients' health.
More and more companies have access to the data, at the same time that it will make it increasingly difficult to control their use.
There is a special law to protect health data, but its effectiveness applies only to health service providers and insurance companies.
A bill that will give authorities the power to inspect businesses specialising in providing data is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: so he developed his program to be linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
Another thing is that the consent in question can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So the hens are, after all, somewhat dependent on the fox's goodwill.
CSU: Temporary Pardon
The fate of the serving duo of Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debacle, the heads have not yet fallen, the debate on personal issues has so far been adjourned by the top of the Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and the country's Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is when this pardon will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a disastrous 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress on the last weekend of October.
Members of the highly criticized duo have in any case been told that they will not be able to cling to their posts with all their strength.
They attempted to reassure the enraged members of the faction and base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavarian Tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the peak of her career - the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, her strength was only good enough for 43.4 percent.
The CSU was a "sammerum" in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
While the conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance for the Hungarian economy, continue to be in a high position, they will in any case be forced into coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of a reorganization within the party is that a member of the narrow intelligence team to begin probe negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or the right-leaning Free Voters, will also be the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, who is considered a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic that on the Free Voters' ticket, Gabriele Pauli, whose appearance against Stoiber was taken by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the coup, but then made a mercilessly short process with an ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition period, the active role will also go to Stoiber, who has so far spanned threads from the background, with the former country's prime minister and former CSU president calling the bitterest day of his political career on September 28.
On Monday, Huber made some snide remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from their sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the September 2009 Bundestag election, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor if the CSU, which played a major role in its national success in 2005, will not be on its feet by joint forces.
According to Merkel, who found it hard to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be simpler, and the Social Democrats' crisis continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result in Bavaria with 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946.
Lukashenko:opozice - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, not a single opposition member made it to the Belarusian parliament.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the well-being and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the illegalities that have occurred in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Though the 110-member legislator of the 10m nation has been missing the opposition well for a decade, the opposition, affiliated with the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS), seriously hoped before yesterday's election that Lukashenko, who had reinstated his presidential mandate for the fourth time on the basis of a constitutional amendment to the constitution with a debatable course in 2006, this time "allowing" for several opposition members to appear in parliament.
The ODS also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
The background to the opposition's expectations was that Russia's increasingly economically dependent Belarus - which had taken credit to mitigate the impact of Russia's ever-increasing natural gas import and contributed to Beltransgaz, owning pipelines passing through the country, into Russian hands - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where, because of the Belarusian political establishment, rated as the anti-democratic Lukashenko, and other high-ranking politicians do not receive initial permits.
The release was previously pointed out by the fact that the OSCE emphasized positive shifts in the election campaign's assessment, and not on shortcomings - for example, to ban the candidacy for a third of the opposition candidates.
Monday's flash report by the OSCE, however, already had reservations about the campaign, during which the opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press, especially to the opposition's failure to see the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, improvements can be felt in the political system after all: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, when he continues to refuse to recognize the detached South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a union-based state on paper, has considered the two territories independent for a month.
"We took two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to keep it that way, even though it has "fledgling power to allow a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament."
Looking at the opposition's results, it does not plan protest actions, rather it is trying to deliver a message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"We have a lot of problems with that, of course, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is put up by obstacles by the local authorities, but I can still see that the change is supported by more and more people, even among the older ones," Milinkevich said, pointing out that the Lukashenka regime, which sees the creation of social safety as its greatest achievement, does not consider the most officially supported layer of pensioners to be the right.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social safety of the 'conquering silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkevich says.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers viewed the election as democratic.
The head of the UAR of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Sergey Lebedev told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but actions," so the absence of the opposition is nothing more than evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Global Marseille menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are mutual leading trading partners, the subject was dominated by the agenda for the ninth summit meeting, in addition to other, largely global challenges.
There will also be a Franco-Indian summit today, primarily at the issue of cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
Indeed, the European Union recognises that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater opportunity to speak to international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to find a common denominator to support New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even discussed further at yesterday's already ninth summit, held in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current president of the Union and the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, and the High Representative for Foreign Policy, Javier Solano, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the turnover of trade within five years, or to rise to more than a hundred billion euros.
With the exchange of goods rising from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, it is not an overly ambitious target.
As a sign of this, twenty-six already existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were aligned in a legal way, so that air transport was given the green light for the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be accelerated.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India's first trading partner, with New Delhi ranking only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit also paid attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, respectively - both sides have condemned it in all its forms and called for an expeditious call for a UN conference.
They also concluded the round of business negotiations from Doha, although both have a large part in its failure to date.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, that it would like to reduce emissions of pollutants by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed to this, as well as the fact that next year's climate conference would need to be struck by a global agreement and the production of gases causing the greenhouse effect to be reduced by fifty percent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to analyse the financial crisis.
India's prime minister arrives today in the French capital, where he is preparing to do business in a bilateral meeting on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
Paris believes French firms will receive a mandate to build India's nuclear reactors worth twenty billion euros.
According to the agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
The large participation of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will attend the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The International Frankfurt Book Fair is expected to see more than 7,000 exhibitors from a hundred and one different countries at this edition, taking over the 171,790-square-metre fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to be seen, with Turkey as a guest of honour.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian pavilion: Italy will in fact attend institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square metres of the exhibition area.
This will be followed by a meeting with the press in Room Struktur Buchmesse in Pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to introduce numbers, tendencies and perspectives in terms of the state of the publishing house in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books by foreign authors relative to the overall Italian production is still diminishing, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
This is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that a revolving door was introduced as staff arrived and gone.
But from today, this new measure will start to work against shrewd people, against those who inject and then go for coffee during working hours.
The novelty against the lazy was presented today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Mauro Masi.
"The winding door - says Brunetta - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more readings and more services" the minister clarifies.
"A new period of responsibility and transparency will now open.
This is about reformism," stresses Brunette.
We will complete the Chigi Palace with the introduction in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There were no objections from the employees, the secretary-general assures: 'This was a joint approach with the staff and the cooperation of all'.
In short, no more breakfast during the working hours; no more coffee and a croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at 7 a.m."
During a conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
in Rome, the minister will eventually announce that during the three months the absence of public employees for the illness has decreased by 50%," that is, by 60,000 more people a year at work'.
And he will add that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its pay-as-you-go dynamics – the minister explains – has doubled in the last 8-10 years, given the private sector and is far higher than the inflation percentage'.
Meanwhile, thousands of public servants have come together to reject the standards of the Brunett decree in accordance with the Codacons-supported request.
"While the Minister of Public Administration will today present the figures concerning the lower absence from working for illness - writing to the consumer protection association - the 'dilutive lazy man' nation is growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and fair public service staff who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree."
Tara will mainly protest against the exclusion of sick pay supplements that depend on the activity; the extension of the time in which the patient can be checked, the time in which the patient can be checked for inspection visits and against other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Industrial accidents, Napolitano: "Resistance Prevention"
Every day, 2,500 work-related accidents happen in Italy, three people die, and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail's values confirm that for 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths as a result of accidents at work.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main reasons for death and causes almost double the death toll compared to the murders.
To re-export the attention of the institutions, social and information means of information about this dramatic problem, Anmil is today celebrating in all Italian regions the 58th national victim of child trauma victims set for the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data widespread by Anmilem and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the important issue of job security," confirms the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Crippled and Invalides for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his keen admiration for the constant joint efforts to ensure safety in jobs, to protect the injured workers, to help the families of the victims, and to complicity of public opinion.".
"Naturally, an outraged 'enough' has been raised, genuinely shared in the face of the tragedies that cause a stir in the media and the participation of public opinion, but the day-to-day reality once again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating in their dynamics'.
Napolitano does not hide that "there, no doubt, is the problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particularly important are the strong in the strongest of the initiative promoted in the field of education, to give young people facing the world's work a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up on its worrisome social seriousness, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
The president of the chamber, Gianfranco, stressed to his part of Fini, "how the phenomenon of death resulting from an accident at work creates an absolutely critical social condition, how the conscience offends each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to bring about the necessary end to this state of affairs."
"As far as data is concerned, they appear to be showing some positive turnover, but this does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from a work-related accident is equally alarming," noted the president of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli, again remarked.
"We would not want this "trade-relief" to lead to less attention, because just as the attention ceases, a tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that there is still too little to stop the problem of injuries, and there are many activities that can have an impact on the problem.
It is essential, in our opinion - stressed by Mercandelli - to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training for staff, from the school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and participation of public opinion.
But it is mainly necessary to make a greater sense of responsibility by employers towards a phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon.".
Mercandelli eventually said it was a progressive degeneration of the level of the right to compensation envisaged for job victims and the "deflection of supportive care" that the system has been receiving in recent years."
"The goal, then, is to return the worker's insurance guarantee to the insurance - he added - because the fate of those who harm must not depend on spontaneity or gifting from time by the legislator."
Mp3 players charged, expose hearing at risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and use portable music devices as Mp3 players can be caused by permanent hearing damage.
According to a European Commission notice published today, which, in an official report, extended in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Committee on Science for Science on the Health Risks that has recently arisen and been identified (Csrseri) Eu.
"From this scientific opinion, we read in notes, it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music machines for at least five years, more than an hour a day a week, and keep the device at a high volume, risking a permanent loss of auditory abilities."
"It worries me that such a large number of young people who use often portable music machines and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unwittingly damage their hearing in an incorrigible way," admits Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - the leader continues - implies a clear risk and a rapid response is needed.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific findings in order to make them entirely effective and to keep up with the new technology'.
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Commendary to examine the problem due to the high use of portable music machines and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists - concluded by the Executive Officer of the Eu - confirm the need to worry and now the European Commission will examine, together with the other members and parties, which have raised the problem of what measures could possibly be put in place and thus better protect children and young people from exposing to noise, the source of which is portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard already in place, limiting the noise level of portable music machines to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing impairment, which may be caused by an exaggerated exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for a solution as a reduction in the level and duration of the exposure.
In its beliefs, the Eu Scientific Committee states that users of portable music machines, when using loud music (more than 89 decibels) for just five hours a week, exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to maximum permitted workplace noise.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risking a permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their amount can be calculated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Rome, Alemanno lets the Commission take the future of the capital
We will start today, close in March, we will have sums in June.
Such is the Campidoglium calendar to the "City of the City of Rome" staff, which met this morning at its new headquarters outside the Caracal Lázně.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and another 49 members of the commission will set up a guidebook for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemann.
"The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included - to emphasise Alemanno - It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political arbitrators that remain Giunta e the Municipal Council.
It is not about exchanging functions, but only an attempt to have a place to process a large project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and then dissolved because this institution must have the exact time term.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and use the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome'.
Anyone who accuses the Commission of futility, given that its opinion will not be binding, Alemanno will say: "It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of good quality, as are the Commission's proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics is sprawled on everyday problems and on the urgencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective , to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither an unnecessary undertaking nor a bluff: it is absolutely free, the Roman citizens will not be the state or the euro and will serve to think and engage in the best intelligence that the capital has."
For Alemann, basically, "you need to have a strategic sketch as a starting point, nor a definite nor immobile, to allow our city to take an authentic rise at the level it needs, and to think with a unified spirit of its future."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome, clarifies, "is not limited to the current municipal borders, but will go much further ahead" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital city, but "also incorporates the role that Rome can and must perform as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? First anti-American president. It's already known why
A well-known US president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam with his decisions."
Attacks against Obama are mounting just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on the website: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he will get to the highest post of nation, which had two governors and five black senators!."
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; are attacks unequivocally of racial origin, and they don't answer the voter's question: will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; everyone says Obama will win and by a wide margin.
Even in this case, there are those who act by the heart and not by the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the bowels of the southern United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the election stall, we know well who an American patriot will give his vote to.
One of the pages of the American mentality will be released on the outcry, which remained skytarious until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll eventually take care of it ourselves, who to tick, whether to Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost a certain success for the Black candidate.
But for all of these musings to the Democrats, George Bush's main weapon.
They questioned 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his term? Eighty-nine percent said: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, for most, Iraq became a weakness for Bush.
Who will take the place of Georgia W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the US was also felt by journalists: the paper is in the survey period. And many blame the internet, the "killer" with the press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the premiss of the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say they had less to worry about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of a devastated economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put together the newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists surveyed, this is a problem that needs to be resolved, if we do not want traditional journalism to be fundamentally changed as understood by the general public.
The American journalist is permeated by clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten print journalists and the executive seniors believe that journalism is going the wrong way on the national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the site is going.
Larger publishers are making their way to the internet, which many view as a "killer" of the press.
The "Economic Press" to which journalists point out has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists surveyed admitted to resorting to technology in the hope of "performing something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is among those who manage the newsrooms – that is, the leaders – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "workcurry certainty" for someone.
The leaders, who think they will lose their jobs within three years, are at the national level of 47%.
As for journalists, they're at 30%.
As for "certain work" involving staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists are working on a contract.
In a nation as vast as the Usa, with three hundred million people and a thousand newspapers, magazines, radios, tv and the internet, employers often offer what they want, and so it is a question of taking or leaving.
The executives almost always get huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month outside of paying for pensions and insurance.
As regards holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick during the course of one year.
It is merely a climate issue.
UNIPOL: CET JUDGET, DANILO COPPOLAELS IN GROTTAPER
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to dismiss the filing of real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked to be transferred from his city, Grottaferraty, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy in connection with the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial, he received his release from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced residency in Grottaferrata.
His attorneys, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, have asked that a real estate entrepreneur be able to change his whereabouts from rural town to capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which he expressed pm)d' allowed him to influence his company and access to the evidence that accuse him of.
Elites in danger
This phenomenon was demonstrated a few days ago, when the Chamber of Representatives voted against the rescue plan to provide the $700 billion presented by the White House: a significant proportion of Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving economics.
This is also confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis will tear apart the Republican side, constantly divided more divided between its old soul, the East Coast, the gentler, the federal institution-friendly and the business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to the "ment of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the states in the central and south.
A soul that arrogantly manifested itself in the vote I spoke about at the beginning.
But this particular thing is just cited is a mere example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, this crisis seems to be operating as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, which have been tightening up in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the reactuality, the extraordinary recovery of the market, the dual category of the State-Emire in relation to a certain nationalisation of economics.
Indeed, the crisis is a crisis in the banking financial institutions, which of course have strong ties abroad, but in which, above all, the largest budgets of people and families living in a single country are included in the largest extent.
Which created a political problem for those who run it: that means answering the difficulties and protests of people and families, which are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be an economically world but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be substantially out of the picture or that it has nothing much to add: the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different state strategies, has given the obvious proof and that is unable to opt for one common political line.
And so everyone is facing the intervention of the government of each individual state, the rescue plans, the revival of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: the moment we get into distress, only the states have economic resources, a multitude of financial resources, to be able to try to get things right.
And they also own the necessary means and the permissions to be able to use them: two sources of immense value, in certain circumstances that perhaps no market and no international organisation will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphase, which the crisis places on the national element, is, in complete harmony with the increasing importance that attempts to attribute the latest economic progress to one factor closely linked to it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of vita, increasingly sophisticated technology, imaterial, while we were convinced that the global finance was already destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to be increasingly grappled with such poorly immense things as water, grain, naphtha.
All the things who would have been told can be transported from one place to the ground to the other, but they are, in any case, connected, absolutely, to the enclosed space, the territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler has a lot more cards up their sleeve than who isn't, and who's unlucky to live in a place without grain, without diesel or water.
I'm getting to the second news, which foresees a break.
Those who talk about the territory, the state, the government, inevitably talk about politics, that is, about leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be forming.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objectively need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who could take up the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discreditability to existing leadership, especially economic, which has proved just as unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, unsettling: the discrediting, impatience, the sense of incompetence and absence that seek to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
Indeed, it seems that it is increasingly expanding in the broad masses of the population of the beliefs than their actions as the ideas of the hitherto popular elites, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the truest sense of the word, that the elite have surpassed their time and are indifferent to the views of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership nourishes one branch from the underground, but a strong movement to remove the ruling classes and the traditional political order is reflected in the sudden election"offs», or in the unexpected changes in collective sentiment in the last and most recent, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavorsk to the Labour's fall in the UK, to the rebellion of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, some would say their format, they have increasing problems to understand, that is to say, to represent, which, not from today, is being created in the deep strata of Western societies and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, growing, potentially too much.
Before this, it would be an exaggeration to talk about a permanent "mask rebellion».
But we certainly can't say it means having your eyes open properly.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Overcoming the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walking on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers and has now come very close to it by a team of four institutes.
Scientists have managed to keep the 100-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall with a sticker of just 2.5 square centimetres.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science published the discoveries of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by a team of researchers is the development of materials already existing, using a special carbon structure called carbon-like carbon pipes.
«The basis of glue can be imagined as a series of trumpets laid out as an arranged pile of spaghetti» is explained by Zhong Lin Wang of the Institute of Georgia of the Atlanta Institute of Technology.
Scientists were inspired by the legs of the geese, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to be able to provide the perfect adhesion.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new glue is ten times the legs of these reptiles and at the same time"se simply peels off the wall» explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Consent, the University of Engineering.
CHODIT'S WILLE? -"This material could be useful as a makeshift glue» is supplied by Liming Dai.
Going to the walls like Spiderman, perhaps? Perhaps so, but researchers think of the far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical appliances, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and power.
Other applications could be about aerospace engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
FURTH RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also researching new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, California scientists introduced glue formed from micro-fibre as hair that is self-cleaning from dust by moving to the surface to still maintain perfect fitting.
Medications: Never with juices
Watch out for the grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed primarily in summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, together with some of the life-saving medicines, their ingestion of them altering the enhancement or reduction of efficacy with severe health consequences.
In order to highlight the risks of juices for both finished and fresh juices in London, with the use of some medicines, in order to highlight the current 263rd National National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: one glass of grep, orange and apple juice, just a need to reduce the absorption of some of the life-saving medicines, to nullify their beneficial effects, and put at risk of patients' health.
Grepe juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to the toxic level the effects of some anti-aritemic drugs, antibiotics, an anxiolite, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
MEDICES IN RISK – This was announced by the Italian Medical Agency itself in an information bulletin two years ago and roused doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink when they take medication, such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NOT ON GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that dampen the drugs.
A long list of effects subdued by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the call for Michele Carruba, director of the Pharmacology Department at the State University of Milan:"Such discoveries are usually immediately announced to the various international and national pharmacy agencies, which eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for drugs.
So read always the illustrative leaves of the drugs you get that you get and if you come across something unclear, don't be alarmed, but ask a doctor or pharmacist to clear up» the expert for the Ansa agency stressed.
The Nobel for Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies in commercial models and localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokeňan who teaches at the University of Priceton and who is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics in the Bush administration's foreign, economic and political moves.
A few months after the assassinations in September 2001, the days on Enron's failure, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in the sense of the implications for the history of the United States, far more important than the first.
A prediction that sparked more than a few polemics, which for years had been reproached for it, but which proved to be accurate.
«I am surprised and shocked by the speed with which collapses such as Enron and Worldcom disappeared from the public's interest, Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "economist of great importance», but also a populariser who has a "very aggressive style, particularly critical of the Bush liberalist administration's excesses».
Open Office, we have the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft» package
It is the release day of the Open Office.org 3.0, the open source personal production package, which is moving toward more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the better-known Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteer workers, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various innovations: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will be added to the revised and improved opening window, far more essential, as a compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) format, 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
The emphasis is also on the cooperation of the Office 2007 package, the Open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the dimensions of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer the PDF folder to the graphics model and maintain the original look of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble the typical Adobe graphic and have the characteristics of a spreadsheet or a text program.
Cooperation is an element that has made many improvements within application programs: in excelllu it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color to commentary to make it clearer identification in the reviewing phase.
Some firms are also working to transfer some of the Open Office features to the Web, and should reimaginate a definitive result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, added to the English version, which is on the mirrorore from Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation cd can be sent to home or to the workplace on request.
And if the theme of free of charge can be a draw to expand in homes, it is on the Open Office business area that the package is betting heavily, and can already count on the various projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there are also offers of training, consulting and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five major models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that goes to replace Excel; Impress for Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, finally, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that as of today we are almost at 3 million and 600,000, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this projected figure can even be surpassed.
Kohl's results are also positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case in the last Tour de France: it is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classed and winner of the best top scorer's T-shirt.
The report was quoted as saying in the pages of the L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth driver positive for Cero, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italech Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples fall into those made in recent weeks by the laboratories of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analyses confirm the positivity at Ceru, the Austrian will lose his third-place finish in the Tour and will have to face a set two years of disqualification.
The report on the positivity of Kohl's third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who announced the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government authorities of the outcome.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium after Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evansema, and also won the polka dot T-shirt of the best top scorer.
IMIGRANTI:NEW YORK TIMES WITH THREE, IS ITALY RASISTOU?
Italy "as a country of emigrants, only in the last house has been transformed into the priority target of immigrants" accepted with resistance.
Does this turn a beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what they are asking in a long New York Times article that addressed this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of a young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed in Milan last month because he stole a box of biscuits.
This case is made visible by what the New York Times defines the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are at the same time the ones registering "more integration and more work" but also "the country's most powerful anti-immigrant mindset and the Northern League's strongest support."
To confirm the increasing tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cites instances of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
The new legislation required by Lega, which seeks to hinder immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
Tendency, highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, having met with Benedetto XVI in the Quirinale, asked that the state and the church work together to defeat racism."
Found plane of Steve Fossetta, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane was found by Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying across the desert in Nevada.
The wreckage was discovered on one plateau at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the border between California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the aircraft.
Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, dispersed the doubts that remained: "The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we are confident that this is exactly the one Steve Fossett flew in the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore clarified that the human remains were not found either in the aircraft or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire has been considered dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (Ntsb) reported that hours after the wreckage was deployed by an investigative team that eventually identified the plane: it is exactly the Bellanc 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossetta's personal items were found in one pair near their residence in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both released by the Illinois Federal Air Administration, cash and one jacket.
The search for Fossett was discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of firsts.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an air balloon: a two-week flight alone.
Three years later, the world went around on the plane and without landing.
His many records also include a flight at an altitude of 15,445 metres, above the Andes, albeit with a copilot.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with original design and well defined decisive lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in a nutshell, the last Glk born in the "compact" jeep of the star's house, by which Mercedes-Benz attempted to bring a whirlwind of news to this sector.
It is thanks to its unconventional treatment that the unexpected and unconventional communication will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk and which will be available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next 17. October.
In this way, the advertising campaign to accompany the debut of the new vehicle will also launch an unofficial method of communication thanks to a futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will be dominated by Milan's main business avenue, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and use special glasses to be distributed near Corsa Como, the new Suv can be seen in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, if you look at the picture, you'll be under the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, using the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be enlightened at different moments in all its trifles to re-frill into a single image.
Mercedes is no doubt trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he be able to arouse the interest of future customers in this way? We'll see.
So we know who the Italian hooligans are
From Triveneto, risking Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been following the Nazionale azzurra for years and which, in truth, has never done exaggerated problems.
She never even met the fans of her opponent.
The group's orientation is right-wing.
The founders are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste e Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact few groups) from Campania and Puglie.
They have three-tone flags on which the desires of the descent of the participants: they were removed on Saturday night to avoid being recognized.
They are inspired by the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they found real Nazi fans, Levsky.
Figc made 144 match tickets available to Italian fans: all in the name, that is, easily controllable.
And Viminale actually checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Dasle, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans who had earlier offenses from the stadium were denied a ticket and a game banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports that come from the Bulgarian police, then take the precaution: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years to at least fans who were arrested or those identified during the riots.
The international Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will not set foot on a single stadium.
To luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: that is, more will be added to those more than a hundred and fifty.
"We must extinguish this fire now and not justify those who behave in this way," they confirm from Viminal.
So, "highly open eyes, mainly for the national match on Wednesday in Lekla."
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of the supporters.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can also count on one part of Aise, this is the secret service, which takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The Chorus Leader-Helor and the taut arm during the Mamel anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime...".
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really little happy way), who is the director of Viminál's Osservatorio for a few weeks (he got a job that was formerly Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a Bursar in Trieste, where the core of the Ultras Italia backers, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to glorify a leader, but of course the behaviour of these 150-200 fans is an embarrassment.
"I am not a sociologist - the Osservator number one adds - the crimes are attributed to the country in which they happened.
So far this group has remained within limits, now let's take a good look at what happened and assess for the future.
However, let us also talk about whistling at the Mamel anthem: even that is not a crime, but if you will, it is rudeness...".
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The leasking market for university students is unfamous of a crisis.
According to the latest research by Suni, the tenants' unions, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"Jev has already reached such proportions that entire classes of students have lost their right to study because of the overall too high prices their families would have to endure – explains the head of the offices of the studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in this city the high demand from students distorted the market in such a way that it has spurted on the price increase that has also swarmed on the residents."
In most cases, rents offerings contain several offences: contracts in a free way, not registered, without capped rent, associated subleases.
For Sunis, there is an exceptional intervention that could regulate prices thanks to the revision of taxes.
If we look at the details of the research, we can see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros per bed, for a single room it is paid from the minimum price of 650 (Barta Nere zone) to the mean value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to the maximum 900 (in the Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room for about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones close to the university, it takes 250/280 euros per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in the single.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 bed in a double.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros for single) zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We will only save the case if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 for the single room of the zones of Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, there is a bed of 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want a bed of 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have more impact on the citizens' economy.
In cities like Perugia, where rents are the most common phenomenon for students from outside the European Union, one more anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about the 25%-30% fee they want from foreign students, compared to the Italian ones.
Farewell to old Paradiso cinema, cities cancel historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls are closing in favour of Multiplex.
"A city without cinema is like blind, it's like an eye-free face."
The painting, offered by director Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in Italy's major city centres, as well as rural towns.
The process of curbing cinemas, the birth of the great multiselias in the suburbs, and the subsequent demise of monsoles in the central quarters of cities, is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but it also has all the hallmarks of true cultural crime.
Often the historical places are disappearing charged with memories," it's as if we've lost a friend, a friend we shared a part of the way and a lot of emotion», is felt by the director of the New Cinema, the film that won the Oscar's Oscar and the Grand Jorure's Jornator's Award for a jury in Cannes, and who told the poetry of a village cinema and mourning for the way of life that the cinema must have lost forever.
The values obtained by the Ancient, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years, the doors of the traditional tip have closed the door to the doors of the traditional cinema, and the highest bill was paid for mainly by the halls in the most important cities: 10 fewer in Florence, by 9 in Milan, by Naples, by 6 less in Torín, by 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected closures, Emilia-Romagna is in first place, with the loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema media: 195 more screenings in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
«The Italian procedure has evolved unparallectly» claims Paolo Protti, President Anecu,"it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the already existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to relocate to the multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about the lack of subsidy for the fund to the operators: the previous national debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
The sector would require between 16 and 18 million euros a year» to support the sector.
What is interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about the closures and which has decided to find a way out by signing the protoclu between the village and the Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historical centres and in the suburbs.
Among the scheduled standards are the steps of tax breaks in favour of the operators and the benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the zone with limited-hand traffic and have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
«This initiative I like» says Giuseppe Tornatore"and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures».
However, in order to oppose the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls need to improve sound and image quality, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a theme that was forever important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to set up the "New Cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk through before the already closed Rialto or Quirinlo in Nazionale Street, where I have shared so much emotion, so that I do not have to look at the inscriptions blackened with dust, I will turn to the other side».
A link between politics and the mafia group 'transaw, Mayor of Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the city's office's elections to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The accusations that the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria are mounting against the mayor and vice-hape of Gioo Tairo Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno, Carlol Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are tough.
Also in the irons, Gioacchino Piromalli, an old intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson's lawyer, the namesake of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia character, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"Ignored all legal and moral standards as well as common sense," the prosecutors write as two local governments expressed their willingness to pay the consultations to the lawyer, Piromalli.
"So the mafia group would have been allowed - written by the judges - to officially enter the city's authorities and have facilitated the already enormous possibilities of public administration control and management."
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide the fact that "there are a lot of "secret agreements between local institutions and organised criminal underworld in his county: "There are areas in which the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where collusion is inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians resisting the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, the heroes who are still untainted'.
This morning's amusement is followed by the imprisonment of July last year, by which police showed that the mafia group Piromalli had been hit by the final hit .
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was the then-protected link between organised crime and local administration - local politicians have been stripped of their positions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who, at the moment of dissolution, was elected head of the right-of-center coalition after the narrower election in May.
He was screaming about the scandal when Prefectutra ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called to accountable then-Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti and accused him of plotting everything for political reasons, but the judges in the imprisonment ordinance signed this morning explain that the mafia group even came to such a distance as to request a change to the A3 motorway project.
Other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors write, came to light "the desire to move the businessman's claims, the representatives of a larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the public administration's choices to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy is born of the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth's surface and is now beginning to be discovered by the world's great energy company.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the eyes of colossus such as Chevron, which is now trying to reach out to these sources, are now trying to reach out to these sources.
The ability to generate energy from sea movements has been studied for more than a century, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell by the time the price of oil fell, the idea of using marine energy went by the wayside. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in the oil price have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) said in London in 2007 that around 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea wave movement.
that amount would be twice the energy currently produced in the nuclear centres.
In addition, there are currents and tides and tides.
The giants attack.
a company that betting on marine energy was Enersis, which agreed in 2005 to build facilities in northern Portugal.
When this intention was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary move.
After two years of betting on marine energy, it is increasingly a society that bets on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"The Chaever is studying ocean energy technology, a spokesman for a company that is linked to the United States oil colossus, the Wall Street Journal, commented on the economic daily newspaper of the Wall Street Journal - and is thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering is about obtaining a permit from the US Energy Commission, which is required to launch a project to use marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially considering that it is in the US that, in Alaska, the US is further mining of oil, and recently President Bush has come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. Traffic follows the trail of marine energy. New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey and the sums invested so far, although not known in detail, show growing interest, according to observers.
Technology, kerou needs to be developed.
Experts talk about the technology that is still in its early stages because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, the facilities in Portugal and some of Scotland are small dimensions and do not seem to be causing major problems for the ecosystem.
But for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the forward.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses the system to fear that are connected to each other.
The power of the waves, which moves with the buoys up and down, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders for the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure spins the turbine, which supplies the energy to the generator.
The energy reaches the shore of underwater cables.
For now, there are four of these types of devices in the project phase, waiting only for federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already generates power for the mall and parking lots by using six Copmogram turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of the water during the tide during the tide is caused by the rotation of the turbines, which feed the generator in this revolving movement.
Verdant commented that they had a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorization because of the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and the low tide.
Particularly interested in the potential of tidal at this point, according to the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although this is a disjointed factor, the tide and the tide are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It was in the energy of the tide and outflows that states such as New York, Maine, and Alaska, and other coastal states, had already invested $7 and a half-million-dollar mileon in 2008, predicting investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
