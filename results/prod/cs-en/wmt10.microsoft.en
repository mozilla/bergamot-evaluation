Barack Obama to receive Nobel Peace Prize as fourth US president
US President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
He will receive a diploma, medal and check for $1.4 million for, among other things, exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House chief will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee, which selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple are then scheduled to meet with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will receive it as america's fourth president, but only the third to win the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when accepting the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is accepting the award as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He stepped up his war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, something none of his critics will forget to stress.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, diploma and cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate them to charity, but he hasn't decided on a specific charity yet.
The busy schedule will then take the president and his wife to a banquet, which will include the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests in addition to the King and Queen of Norway.
From the outset, Obama was more reticent about the price.
For example, he stated that he felt he did not fully deserve it.
He also reiterated several times that this is not just a prize for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "call to action" for him.
Conservationist charged with extortion
Litoměřice police have accused the chairman of the civic association Society of Conservationists litoměřice of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he has appealed to some construction proceedings, demanding money from investors for his own benefit for the withdrawal of the appeal, said Alena Romová, a litoměřice police spokeswoman.
Lubomír Studnička is chairman of the Litoměřice Society of ConservationIsts.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers don't smell much of Brno
In Prague, ordinary people can sort beverage packaging, in South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to take a few minutes to find suitable bins.
I do not want to say that waste is not sorted at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that the fact that we are the second largest city in the republic is of insufficient interest to the councillors.
Brno is in the forest league of waste sorting not only because, as citizens, we can still throw only paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but above all the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle in a collection basket in the centre?
It's a done job, it takes time and nerves.
The only place I have come across so far is on Moravské náměstí opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues be mad at me, but it doesn't look a damn good enough.
Not to mention that in other parts, waste sorting is no honey.
Many of my friends prefer not to sort the waste.
Laziness.
They're a long way from the dumpsters.
I don't blame them.
I offered to throw away some glass and plastic bottles myself after the party.
But I didn't see any colored trash cans on Kounicova Street any time yet.
Luckily, I hit the right spot on the way to the saliva.
But the garbage was overflowing.
After all, it is still the center of Brno, which perhaps represents the city the most, right?!
But the ecology and some aesthetics probably don't interest brno socialists very much.
They would rather buy the city a hockey extraliga, which will embarrass us all over the country, rather than buy a few extra containers and offer to sort other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that after a while of browsing the Internet, I was able to confirm my hypothesis with official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM data, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian Region.
"Paroubek's" budget took money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has added to farmers or officials, despite the government's view, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sick pay, or building savings.
But also interest on national debt or international litigation.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for an increase for some groups, they relied on the government to borrow additionally for sensitive expenses, pensions, or sick leave. "It's just postponing problems to the future, laying mines," says Janota.
Borrowed money pays increasing interest and must sometimes be returned.
The state doesn't have much choice about where to get it.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
Everyone the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
People do not have to worry about pensions or sick leave, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, they will get them.
But at the cost of the state becoming more indebted – next year, only $163 billion will be missing from the box office, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave, as the government did in its anti-deffit package.
Because of the money shifts for several groups of voters, $5 billion will also be missing next year for the completion of highways and railways.
These are mainly already competed and built-up sections, which can not be reprojected and possibly cheaper.
At most, conserve, which is also not free.
This means delaying or stopping 30 large buildings, and the use of European money is also at risk, warns Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD has proposed that it will solve the loss of money in Solomon – it will reach into CEZ's dividends, which the state mostly owns, and from them it will add to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and certainly not a tax-free resource.
Last year, 18 billion came from CEZ to the budget.
Every year, dividends pay for the settlement of environmental damage, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
Moreover, under EU rules, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
But the carnival of transfers does not end there.
Nearly $3 billion has been spent on various compensations for victims of communism and crime, or on litigation expenses, even building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is uncertain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we'll have to pay for it anyway, janota says.
The minister will then have to save money inside the department or, worst-case scenario, touch the government's budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing from the already under-run $2 billion Treasury project, which is intended to enable online monitoring of what individual authorities spend.
The first stage will start in January.
If the Finance Minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, janota warns.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a button.
The plans revealed sound promising.
Just press one key and transfer to Android from Windows Mobile in seconds.
This is precisely the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to keep two user profiles on your mobile at once.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
They'll both be working at the same time, suggested Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first shown a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran side by side.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is underway.
Now VMware is working with European and AMERICAN operators to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices should reach customers within 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
The bare slopes are not only a concern for the Giant Mountains ski lifters.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why you can still get available rooms in the Giant Mountains for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of traffic on our website.
People go through offers, find out prices, but so far they are afraid to order bindingly.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this Christmas will be in snow or mud," said martin jandura, the operator of the Spindl.Info portal.
Those who want a New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly as they wished should not hesitate to order.
Those who prefer to save money and the quality of accommodation is second only to them can still try to wait a few days.
Meanwhile, Špindlerov hoteliers offer mostly weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try to turn them in for a while, but then they're going to let go and go for a shorter period of time.
And then the rooms will dwindle quickly," Jandura said.
Free beds in all winter dates are still offered by the Vrchlabi travel agency Ingtours.
What we're most interested in right now is Christmas week, which hasn't sold out yet.
About half of the seats on our offer remain vacant.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays," said Petr Schiefert, director of Ingtours.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still be offered by the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fortnight in February is also good for sales, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if he attacks.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will also sell out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou are slightly better than last year.
We're about five percent better off.
We have the last few places on New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is a lot of interest in Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well," said Karel Rada, director of the best Hotel In The Czech Republic.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are occupied by the Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain available at the newest Janskolázeň hotel for Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, which we already have about sixty percent occupied at the moment.
February is a little weaker so far, but once the snow falls, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will definitely increase, said Erik Sporysch, director of the Omnia Hotel.
However, for the time it is time for the Giant Mountains hoteliers to get a taste for the larger snowfall.
It's supposed to cool down on Thursday, if there's any precipitation, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, said Jiří Jakubský from the Hradec Office of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical how, with the schoolboy efforts of Barack Obama, a president with a reputation for being the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered the stupidest, on the Afghan issue.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it through a copy machine from Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to use the title of bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration, "A New Way Forward."
Yet three years ago, he criticized Bush's idea to send fresh military reinforcements to civil war-torn Iraq as "an irresponsible and catastrophic decision in its afters."
But the months that followed showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field commanders, was the only possible and great success so much that there is no talk of Iraq in news reports today.
It did not improve Bush's reputation, but objectively left his successor far more grateful than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes for a repeat of the miracle.
Field commanders, notable Afghan Operation Commander General Stanley McCristal, who, despite subordination practices, harshly criticized the hesitant white house shooters, again asked him to increase his military contingent.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so at least he cheated the general by 10,000 troops.
He was able to pull another 5,000 out of Europe, even though he had originally planned for at least 10.
The most problematic thing about Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as little as 18 months and end the process within three years; the entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a half-hearted increase will bear the same fruit as the advance in Iraq.
Despite the fratricicipation wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honoring the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite symptom - no one can be relied upon, and no agreements are being followed.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing master every day, are difficult to prepare according to how it suits them.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a potemkin village, for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complex, given the missor of circumstances that make Pakistani and Iranian influences even more difficult.
Even building an "actionable state," which is a minimalist goal of the operation, doesn't seem very realistic.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is puzzled by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent into the war for the purpose of "returning home soon" will cause a miracle here can only be a true romantic soul, untouched by reality.
Politically, setting a date for troop withdrawals is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will see this as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is on the downs.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothoe of the Hindu Kukush.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and intensified sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the question arises before the United States whether to try to solve the problem with military force.
It will need to be answered just as, according to Obama, America is on the way to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any such solution will also mark a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only band-aid for Barack Obama is that there are three years left before the presidential election, and therefore there is still time for him to come up with another strategy if this proves to be a total flop.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash rewards
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
This was announced by a company that responds to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 leading managers will receive shares instead of money that can be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to link Wall Street rewards to long-term performance, according to Reuters.
"I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take," said douglas Elliott, a former investment banker at JPMorgan.
The problem is the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has come under criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion (almost $300 billion) in bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total amount of remuneration in the company this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political issue in many countries with the arrival of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to burden bankers' bonuses of more than £25,000 (about £200,000) with a 50% tax.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics
A record five women took over from King Carl XVI of Sweden in Stockholm today. Gustafa this year's Nobel Prize in professional categories and for literature.
In addition to four female scientists, among them was a German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müllerová.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and their compatriot Jack Szosek, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their chromosome research.
The chemistry prize went to Israeli Ada Jonath, along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate was the Nobel Prize in Economics, awarded to Elinor Ostrom of The Americans and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for her analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
This award was embed today by scientists Charles Kao for research in optical fiber and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each award winner received a diploma, a Nobel Medal and a certificate of financial reward.
For each category, it amounts to ten million Swedish crowns (roughly CZK 25 million).
If there are more than one of them in each of them, they share the reward among themselves.
Us President Barack Obama received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his award, as he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, he heads a country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But, defending his policies, he added that wars are necessary in some situations to win peace, even if the cost of doing so is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle.
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduardo Janota on Friday morning, who is considering remaining in the government because he does not agree with the form of next year's state budget, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
The budget, and perhaps Janot's remaining in the cabinet, is expected to be the subject of their meeting on Friday.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, it has too large a deficit, which further exacerbates the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by the president's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his continued stay in office with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the Budget Act, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should run a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
But on Wednesday, the House approved the left's proposals to move money and raise money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the social democracy proposals for secretly increasing the budget deficit.
This has created a bitter internal political dispute between the left on one side and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which is starting to raise a question mark over the further operation of Fischer's official cabinet, which the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party agreed to form in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially eliminates the austerity package that fischer's government pushed through in the fall to stop the state's debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget law, said at a discussion breakfast with businessmen today that politicians had neglected for a long time the "serious problem" of "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
Today, he says, he no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvements, which could also be underpinn by a broader consensus of political parties, the president thinks.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget was scary and the government should consider the continued existence.
Ods Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of čssd, ods and greens clearly no longer works.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "strong statements."
Jiří Paroubek, head of the ČSSD, responded to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year, which will exceed CZK 200 billion, is appalling.
Already on Wednesday, čssd called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's novelty
South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories, despite some critics saying that American actors play the lead roles.
The story tells of sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless campaigner against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, in his life story is presented by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said 91-year-old Mandela asked him if he could portray him in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I told him, 'If I'm going to play you, I'm going to have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won an award for his role in Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the slavery abolition movement, who eventually became a slave, the fictional President of the United States, and even God in Divine Evan, but rarely someone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his active work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is the Latin word for undefeated and is the title of a poem by The English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who are among the underdogs worldwide.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story on the screen.
"I had no other goal than to play this role to bring it as close to reality as possible," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I squeezed your hand, I took your energy, it transferred, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon stars in françois pienaar, captain of a national rugby team dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
The big surprise for him was when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it for me, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look so much bigger in a movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the actors' characters compared to their actual originals under director Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated has received positive reviews, and there is talk of Oscar ambitions.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his review, saying, "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway unsealed: Russians test missile
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only yesterday admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile, referred to as the "Bulava" missile, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a black moth for both Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in missile tests did not have an appropriate effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava usually didn't take off at all or was damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers already call "Bulava" a "rocket that does not fly."
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights up
This was the 13th attempt that went normally at first.
It was only at the end of the flight that the apparatus was again technically damaged.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed beneath the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows firing from a vessel that is in motion and submerged at the same time.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a broken "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians did not doubt from the very first moment that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals are defending themselves, saying that there can be no clear talk of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted, and the accident affected only the third.
In previous cases, the engines broke down in the first stage.
Although not a single test launch has been made without error, only six out of 13 are considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defence leadership.
As a result, the nearly 50% success rate fills the generals with optimism, and so they still claim that "Bulava" will one day fly without problems, and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will again play in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup champion will help his TEAM CSKA Moscow in an emergency and will probably start in Friday's KHL match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired at the age of forty in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulyaš is injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov trains regularly and has agreed to help the team.
We just need to work out some formalities, AP quoted moscow club coach Sergei Nemtsov as saying.
It is not yet clear whether the famous hockey player's comeback will concern just one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirit of other players, said Nemtsov.
Fetisov will become Russia's oldest professional ice hockey player if he returns to the ice, according to ap.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at age 51, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic golds, seven world championship titles, and triumphed at the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also scored success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup over his head in a Detroit jersey.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai complied with the union. Cancels all overtime
The management of Hyundai, a nošovice car company, has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the often-imposed overtime that the unions declared a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, a spokesman for Hyundai.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, which is essential, which is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being done, vaněk said.
The Sedmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work saturday shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
This will also be given to people retroa back on a working Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňek, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
They can either pay overtime pay or they can take a compensating leave on December 28th, thus extending the Christmas holidays by a day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all saturday shift employees will receive paid fares and lunch.
Since overtime was the most sensitive and pressing point in terms of comments and complaints from trade unionists, as well as protesting employees who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to cancel all overtime for December with immediate effect, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the carmaker's employees were forced to work two hours of overtime virtually every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions will call off the strike alert
Further negotiations between the carmaker's management and trade unionists are due to take place on Friday morning.
The head of the union, Petr Kuchař, said on Wednesday that if they agreed to meet the requirements and signed a joint document, they were ready to cancel the strike alert.
The situation at the automaker came to a sharpen last Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
Management opposed that overtime must be done by employees to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
In their announcement of a strike alert on Monday, trade unionists also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on workers who cut production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the union is asking the company to keep overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of CZK 5,000 for it this year.
Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The company started mass production last November.
By September this year, it had produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works even on 'numb' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow down the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity to drugs.
In some cases, this fact outweighs the fact that the compound does not act as strongly on a common variant of the virus as some already available drugs.
AIDS is not yet curable.
However, patients can significantly prolong life with a mixture of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Moreover, the incomplete suppression of the spread of the virus results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which the drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the University of The University of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metallocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new 'enhanced' compounds prepared based on knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metallocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Mature infectious viral particles would not have been created without HIV protease caused by HIV fission.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically altered.
Slightly weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV protease substances has been tested in a test tube as well as against its resistant (resistant) variants derived from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on a common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications, make metallocarborans interesting compounds for further research leading to the design of effective HIV drugs," says Pavlína Řezáčová, Head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
A fight over the budget. The ODS has taken on Fischer, who is defending himself
The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, called next year's approved budget "appalling", and prime minister Jan Fischer's government should consider another existence, he said.
The ODS statement was described by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He says he's saving time for analysis.
Ods Vice-President Petr Nečas said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the House to combat the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed, Nečas pointed out.
On Wednesday, the House adopted a budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments worth more than CZK 12 billion.
The House has increased money for civil servants' salaries, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's resucer on the social democracy proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, complying with the government's wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, prime minister Jan Fischer said the government would reconsider the current situation.
Nečas believes that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign if amendments had been adopted, the situation might have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering remaining in office.
This is due to his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
According to Nečas, if Fischer is in the process of further combating the budget deficit, the čssd nominees, who pushed through the changes in the budget, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes other deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sick leave, pensions, or an amendment to the Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS have not been blamed
It is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the USA.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in deputy positions who subscribe to the TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of combating the general government deficit, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he will lean on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
But then, he says, he can't count on the support and tolerance of the Civic Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and when it's up to date, I'll look into it,' Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was nominated to the cabinet by the Citizens' Democrats, told reporters in the Chamber.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels this afternoon for a European Council meeting.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS withdrew
At the same time, Nečas stressed that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the Members of the Civic Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was burdened by the absence of the party chairman in parliament and the Czech Republic in the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice missing.
Even when I was relinquishing my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be all about the Bolshevik of the House and the destruction of all positive things, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new ČD rules, fewer trains will run at almost the same fare
From 13 December, Czech Railways will cancel or reduce some less busy express trains and locales, while other services will be strengthened.
The total scope of transport will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava will get more connections to the capital, and the railways will add one pendolino set to this line.
On the contrary, the express train will stop going to Bratislava.
Fewer express trains will also run on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, direct services prague - Letohrad will be significantly reduced.
From the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction in traffic in the Hradec Králové Region, by a total of eight percent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line is limited to some days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today Milovický has to transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the suburban Esko system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance services to the capital will end at the prague central station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino services between Prague and Ostrava, and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run at two-hour intervals.
From 13 December, passengers will no longer be taken by pendolin to Bratislava.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, in total it will give the railways CZK 4 billion next year to cover the so-called demonstrable loss, just as this year. Localities order regions, they will pay a total of eight billion crowns for them next year, with less than three billion crowns contributed by the state to the regions.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For local and express trains, the railways have a newly concluded ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The railways praise the system, which is probably why they did not reach the price increase of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur with one-day ČD Net network tickets and cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLiška will now be based on the distance travelled, until now it has been uniform for the journey between any regional cities and amounted to CZK 160.
Philippine militants still detain over 50 people, children released
Militants kidnapped 75 people today in the south of the Philippines, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 militants are said to be using the hostages as a living shield as they flee from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to negotiate the extradition of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, police originally pursued the kidnappers because of violence that required accounts to be serached between two local family clans.
Martial law has been declared in the south of the Philippines in Maguindanao province due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the gubernaial elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao Island.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film Invictus (the official title in English: Invictus: Undefeated) arrives in US cinemas in the coming days, capturing part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, who was said to have chosen Mandela himself for his portrayal years ago, took on the role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter.
Matt Damon took on the supporting male role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar.
With the release of the film, they are ingesting the reviews of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he and de Klerko received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as it comes at a time when preparations for the World Cup are at their peak in South Africa, but at the same time the media is being rocked by disturbing news of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film in South Africa has so far been positive, despite numerous reservations about casting the main roles by "smudified" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he's proud of the new film.
I've been dreaming about this role for years, and I've been preparing well for it.
"I have also met Nelson Mandela in person many times to - as they say - recharge his energy," he said in an interview after the film's los Angeles premiere.
I think it's a good thing if we can remind the film of Mandela's personality and message.
It's a South African story, but it concerns every person, he added.
In a national rugby team jersey
Based on a book by British writer John Carlin with the loosely translated title In The Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Play That Gave Rise to the Nation, the film portrays a South African human rights advocate during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman thus tries to bring together two racial and long-defined groups of the population during the film, and, as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters the World Cup field, which South Africa won in 1995, in an acting role in the South African national rugby jersey.
Mandela received a large ovation from a predominantly white audience 14 years ago for entering the lawn in a jersey that is almost seen as something sacred in South Africa and earned the recognition of the white population.
The Football Championship may be able to bring people back together in one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
But white South Africans are sceptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain, revealed in a recent interview with LN.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns is burning in Lounsko
The fire engulfed the Čeps transformer in the substation near the village of Výškov in Lounsko in the morning.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the Ústí Regional Fire Brigade, six units are involved in the fire.
Originally, firefighters wanted to burn out the transformer, but later reconsidered the opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing agent.
The cause was a technical fault, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandátová, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be accurately quantified only after the end of the fire.
According to Mandate, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
In ten years of operation čeps nothing like this has happened, defects of this type are rare, she added.
According to CEZ spokeswoman for Northern Bohemia, Sonia Holinger Hendrychová, the electricity supply was not interrupted, the operation of households, offices or companies was not affected by the fire at the transformer station.
A.s. Čeps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 substations with 67 converters transferring electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system and a 4339 kilometre line route.
Jančura will file a criminal complaint for defamation against three governors from the ČSSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura will file a defamation complaint against three social democratic governors today.
This is to Michal Hašek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice Region and the Governor of the Olomouc Region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura stated this in Twenty Minutes radiožurnál.
The lawsuit relates to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some counties.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, yet we only made an offer for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It's for defamation against the Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
At the same time, he stated that he had evidence from all the regions that they had not taken action in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Hašek considers the filing of a criminal complaint to be a continuation of Mr. Jančura's media show, which serves as unpaid advertising by his companies and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and mine, and I will invite the other governors to do the same.
I assume that, even on this occasion, it will become clear that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public and using false and untrue arguments in the matter of regional rail transport, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that it was investing several million crowns in advertising that would draw attention to the disadvantageous move of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would suspend the campaign after Christmas and continue it after the New Year.
He clarified that the campaign would be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway links with Czech Railways and did not write tenders for a contract of around CZK 150 billion.
According to Jančura, such conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Jančura was already threatened by the ČSSD MP because of criticism of train transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccination against pneumococos will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococoches from January will tear down the habits of the past.
It is supposed to be the first for families free of charge and optional at the same time.
But there are already voices that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococoks are culminating.
The Drug Institute is already setting maximum prices for vaccines paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear about the procedure for vaccination.
New vaccinations
Free vaccines for August children
From January, children born on or after 2 August last year can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococoka.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Those who started vaccination last year or earlier must pay for another booster.
The first dose of vaccination must be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily had their children vaccinated against pneumococtics.
At the same time, the parents paid CZK 1600 for one dose or more.
When vaccinating the youngest children, four doses are required.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between CZK 300,000 and CZK 450,000 per year on vaccination benefits.
But it will save on the treatment that children without vaccinations would need.
So far, the state has given about $500,000 a year for all blanket vaccinations of children.
The paid vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumacoction causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the cerebral moor and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 children under the age of 10 die from pneumoco infection in our country in a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced paid general vaccination of children against pneumococos in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it is to be covered by insurance companies and optional.
Rudolf Kalovský, head of the civic association Aloud, suggested that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococococo vaccines for a long time.
The experts at the international conference that our association participated in were not entirely satisfied that we had voluntary vaccinations.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been enforced.
"I think that's the path we have to take now," Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococoks.
At the moment, we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Hornet.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors
Hana Cabrnochová, President of the Professional Society of General PediatricIans, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of boosters could be considered "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a large amount, we understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," cabrnoch says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumoco from next year.
Vaccination against pneumococos is also groundbreaking in that it is the first general vaccination of children paid for by health insurance companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving money on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy substances themselves
However, this is linked to the concerns of general practitioners regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies and given to doctors in the same way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
But some MPs feared that this could "take money out of health insurance."
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the substances and wait for the insurance companies to pay them back.
It is estimated that individual gps will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, a significant sum.
It's not going to be easy, cabrnoch says.
American artist's son 'stole from museum'
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been charged with attempting to steal $20 million (£12 million) worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr Frazetta and the other man used an excavator to break into a muse in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Sr., 81 years old, is best known for creating the characters Of Barbaro Conan and Tarzan.
The artist was in Florida at the time of the incident, the Associated Press reported.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated to act by long-running family feuds.
Before the police, Mr. Frazetta Jr. issued an affidavit, age 52, saying that he had done so at the behest of his father "to get to the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to the malting grounds," according to the agency.
Mr Frazetta Sr. denied granting any such permission, as the agency said.
Labour resists planned tax rises
The Minits defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Tories have "squandered" the opportunity to show that they are serious about postponing the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
Even the Chancellor has come under fire for the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment in public payments since 2011.
Social security indentation
The union protested that low-income workers had been punished for a recession they did not cause and warned in advance of "problems."
Social security is rising - an increase of around £3 trillion a year - which has outraged the business community, who have said it is an employment tax while the focus should be on rebuilding the economy.
Around 10 million workers will be affected by this increase, which is limited to these incomes of more than £20,000 a year.
PBR KEY POINTS
Social security will increase by a further 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected by 4.75% this year
New taxation of 50% of bankers' bonuses
Increase in 1% corporate tax on depreciation for small businesses
Tax reductions for electric cars and wind farms
Increase in pension assessment by 2.5%
According to the Treasury's estimate, some incomes of £30,000 will be reduced by £90 a year, and some incomes of £40,000 will be reduced by £190, while some incomes of £10,000 will increase by £110.
Ministers said their target of halved deficits by 2013 meant "difficult decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should go to the top 5% of the highest earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increase and spending cuts were a "drop in the ocean" compared to what would have to be done.
"They're big numbers. This will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolutely essential requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he believed the economy should grow at the turn of the year.
But forecasting for future economic growth - which will affect the volume of borrowing needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced - must be taken into account after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier amounts.
In a statement, he said the economy's decline this year was 4.75% - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - because borrowing was £3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
Missed opportunity'
The Conservatives, who launched a new publicity campaign on Thursday warning of Labour's "debt crisis," described the planned £789 trillion loan over the next six years as unbearable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan for how this could be paid for, adding that they had "cynically" postponed the decision until after the election - which must take place by June 2010.
"They have not added anything significant that is feasible," said Philip Hammond, the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. "They had a chance to do it, but they squandered it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, in contrast to tory proposals to reduce the deficit faster and more widely.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are "built on sand."
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcement - for example, the above inflation will rise and benefits will be incapacitated next April - could lead to the Chancellor being impeached in the election campaign if the money is difficult to recover a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation is revised in September 2010.
Suspicious budget'
Although ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that a reduction in public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term cuts.
The respected Institute for Budget Studies said the Chancellor's figures suggest substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All important statements will come after the election if we win them," added Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to Deloitte's accounts.
"That was a report on a suspicious preliminary budget. The markets are implementing it."
FBI conducts investigation in 'U.S. prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation into five Americans suspected of links to extremists in a Prison in Pakistan.
The men were arrested for attacking a house in Sargoda, eastern Panda province, the US Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether the same men were reported missing last month at their home in the US state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about obtaining information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistan origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were U.S. citizens, we would be very interested to know under what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they were there," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency has been informed of the arrest and has been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washgington said the men were arrested at a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It stated that the house had always been the focus of local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States must "work much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The disappearance of the five students from their northern Virginia home was reported by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of amnesty for Iranian abuses.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report details the "methods of torture" in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was at risk of rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of the report on respect for human rights.
Officials called the criticism politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been imprisoned in Iran and dozens have been killed following the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street demonstrations since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens of them were remanded in custody and prosecutors sentenced the last five people to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent John Leyne, now in London, said that earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayyatollah Ali Khomeini had declared that some forms of torture were unjustified and banned them from being carried out at karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticisms of legal power have been tolerated, as our correspondent stated.
False confession'
Amnesty International quoted a report by Ibrahim Methari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who said he had been charged with "working with Facebook" and protesting the election results.
"I was often beaten in the face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Kharroubi was detained after protests after the election and tortured to death in prison, and others were raped.
Iranian senior civil servants denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he was being held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizaku.
Amnesty acknowledged that iran's parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate post-election unrest and government responses, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees had been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow have been used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a downhill track for the race.
The downhill track for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowbordists to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the downhill track at Brandon Hill Park was a short ski jump in front of the 100m downhill track.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a wonderful view from the top of the downhill track, but that it was really disheartening.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowbordists from all over the country - some of them real talents," he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best stunts - or maneuvers on the downhill track.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets, and alarms are widely circulating about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written and reported, poised on whether Muslims can integrate - and integrate - into one of the continent's most open secular societies.
After reading this book, some readers became admirers of the author's latest work, "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), this elegant and discussed study of the contentious issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and much more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the base.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now care for 5÷6 million French Muslims, which Mr Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim enter into matrimony in a mosque or city hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be ediced on gay development and rights?
Can a Muslim woman married to a man who is not Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-based banking system if he wants to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly muscular contentious issues that are being discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others well-known persons, including Tarik Ramadan, an Arab, Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a debate about how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their usuals.
Conservatives are distrustful of the true idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen interviewed are in the hope that this is the antithesis of Selafi,the sunni islam purist supporters associated with Saudi Arabia, a group that is small but affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite that so doggedly defends the general public) are truly committed to the idea of pluralism.
He believes that Muslims probably have less experience on matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who also had to make historic compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found "tightening the screws of values."
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The bleakest prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing faster than the planet's other environments.
The bordering ice melts at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they wake up.
In "On Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, recounts the natural history of the Icon of the North, the Polar Bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling, he describes a long tradition of polar explorers trying to seize a white bear.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a brave 14-year-old lifeguard who fought only a musket collision is a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears that swam behind the bodies of their just-killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed in one circus tent at a time.
Even today, zoo enclosures typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adult individuals in the wild. Climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat of hunters threatening the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indians ski are hunted and all armed with powerful attack rifles to shoot their prey.
Ironically, it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations, and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, "After The Ice," Alun Anderson, the former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and disisuasive responsibility for science for the Arctic and an eye-catching glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not everything scientists have answers to.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers don't have an adequate response to the rate of change.
That's for lack of rehearsals.
Fridtjof Nansen's research trips in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated how floating ice moves.
Cold War submarines then mapped the resuperte as they sailed through them.
Satellite exploration and vast fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but much is still being done thanks to intrepid individuals camped out in winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the catchment system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water, which shrinks when it freezes.
But from the sua down to the microscopic wonders inside, all of this is doomed as soon as the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.

6,000 Marines lay wreaths at graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day in which they paid tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
"In a few months, when we board, it could be us," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me so that they show me respect in the way that I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the Veterans Cemetery in several departments at a memorial service in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of worcester's funeral company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in a reverent act in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition where Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this trip every year and stop in various cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcestesters are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America that they lay in other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the memorial site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year running, the Walmart Foundation is donating more than $150,000 to buy and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs Hunt said it was her way of returning what the victim was doing.
It's a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Shrouded in warm cloth cloaks, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World War I and Ii and the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive as the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine to the red tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red round and top.
There was a real silence near Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are housed.
The combined service organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the wars that were going on filled the area.
Some wept sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names, engraved in stones, while others bent down to look at small black-and-white nametags, pushed into the wet mud where tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers wiping tears from their eyes in front of their son's grave.
She was eight hours away from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the final resting place of Navy Gunners Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid the price, she said.
"Even though I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. government contractor jailed by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who imported cellphones and laptops into the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interest Department in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
Some charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is described as "dangerous."
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical stats, risk imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but has been denied permission.
The detention of the American contractor may be the result of growing tensions between the communist Castro brother, who ruling Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been watched as a "delaying tactic" in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report on the New York Times' arrest on Friday night.
The new US policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used when sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
Internet use on the island is exceptionally limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors, and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to apply, must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detaining an American in Cuba is a rarity.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for acts such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berben, a press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
Imprisonment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - such as free cell phones - are a criminal offense in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the group's U.S. human rights program, who recently published an unfavorable report on freedoms in Cuba, titled "New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader and a replacement for his ailing older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would be rather political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving toward greater dialogue.
Pakistan's government officials are uncovering a conspiracy to broadcast men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged ring leader of a plot to send five northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters snooping online to search for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of the men posted a comment affotiating the terrorist attacks on the YouTube website.
Saifillah took charge of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them reach a remote area of Pakistan in the Pakistan indigenous tribes zone, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported on the case said Saturday that Saifullah had been unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were dropped off for several days in the eastern district of Sarghody, far from the menacing mountains of the northwest that had become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered a strike force.
Why they were dropped off, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to gain approval to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of the five - who remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. intelligence has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
American fake recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years in allowing kohu to approach them because U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to infiltrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much? mr Kohlmann said.
This model is one of those that is much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday demanding stronger climate action from negotiators at the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of the small incident in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city carrying banners reading "This is not Planet B" (i.e. second-rate) and one in Spanish proclaiming "Earth says 'enough'."
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she traveled to her mother's birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the bleak state of the country, which is affected by the effects of climate change that are still occurring.
That's part of why we decided to join this great march -- to walk the world and appeal to world leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious, and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, it is impossible to avoid it all the time.
Police prevented protesters from approaching downtown Bella and said they detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating spectators, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and wearing black suits laid several charges near Copenhagen's main canal, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated near the buildings, he said, opening with flares, but then "several large explosions" ensued.
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of" (it really is something I do not realize).
Then he went on to chinese and said , "Because the venue is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone's prospects.
You can see the concentration of the general public and different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that this is a violation of the conduct or freedom of others.
Test data revealed persistent racial disparities
Last week's federal certificate of math attainment was a welcome element of good news for the District of Columbia's public education system.
While the district lags far behind the country's high-performance systems, the certification showed greater progress among fourth- and eighth-graders in the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures from the National Attestation Center for Educational Progress are the persistent differences in attainment between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth-graders in the District of Columbia over the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but their African-American peers have grown by only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the knowledge gap increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among eighth-grade African-Americans remains essentially even, with a shift of one point from 245 to 245 statistically insignificant.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was performed in the district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
Although the achieved result in oboiu group children improved during this period, the difference was barely close to 58.
Some education advocates in the district have said in the past week that the results, celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), have been more extensively stimulated among white students where results have already been high.
That would say that we've increased the total support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates for equal education in the district.
I'm not jumping up and down because of a two- or three-point spread, said committee member D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Often critical of Ms. Rhee's management style, Ms. Brown said that reporting test results meant that the city's high school system was in a desperate state and required attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the positives, and I respect that.
But what is appalling is that we have devoted almost no time and energy to our secondary education.
Ms. Rhee said the district's effort is to continue looking for better ways to focus on the needs of low-income students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at elementary school upper-class students and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their collote careers and lag significantly behind their peers.
The daily mathematics and curriculum of sixth-grade math teaching, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that came to the district under former Principal Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I just think we should keep working and make the best possible interventions for those students who remain below class level, Ms. Rhee said.
Others said the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
It's a particular dilemma for Ms. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where she studies test scores in urban areas.
The conventional remedy is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
In this way, focus can bring political reverbers that go against an important agenda.
But the resuasuring also belongs to other city directors who are trying to maintain a middle-class average between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We must make our schools more affinity so that all families, no matter where they live, can count on their children to be given excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now newark's school principal, said in an interview this week that an essential element in reducing the attainment gap is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to make schools more justified.
You need to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a 185-day contract with his teachers' association last year for the school year, which he considers a "symptom" of seeking a bigger increase next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The tour bus entered the Gettysburg College with a loud sigh of breath.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Grace's parents hardly graduated from college in El Salvador.
Until now, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never set foot on the dorm floor.
Now she and other eighth-grade students in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their status being more than frightened visitors to enthusiastic potential students.
yes! That's it! cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully, when they were told of the low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of seven they visited on their three-day trip and were now completely intrigued by the future message: The question is not whether you will enter the dorm.
The question is from where.
But this is a big problem for the high number of U.S. births of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from college or become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, a fifth of this "rainbow generation" of Spanish college students - remarkable achievements indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, have entered the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, researchers say, because it underscores their point of advance for a generation that has played a marginal role in the country's labor force.
Those who achieved a university degree say they had a natural affection for school and innate penetration and an effort to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and the millions of children who would like to graduate from college - especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we take into account that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point will not solve it, says Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied Latino students.
We need to think about giving these children a safety net in preschool in every way possible to get through college.
The federal program that funded Graciely's dorm tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run college preparatory programs that begin for students from low-income high school groups and continue until those students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than 1% of whom have entered dormitories, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their ailing infrastructure during two auctions on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been concluded by iraq's Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in rebuilding Iraq's oil industry, crippled by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies left with capital participation in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
Only one submitted a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for the field, which was auctioned in June.
The mead participation of US oil giants in Iraq's open oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans on the road in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
That'll be long before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to deter American companies from doing much more business in Iraq, which has demonstrably the third-largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
American firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have noticeably lower operating costs and are more prone to risk-taking because they do not answer to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to make deals with the State Department.
Leading U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with iraq's oil ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
China's state-owned National Petroleum Corp. participated in bids for more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological force, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Oil Ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that have been pre-selected to submit bids, which have then been compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel, and the Ministry is willing to pay to boost output above current levels in each field.
A top al-Qaeda planner is believed to have been killed in Pakistan.
A top al-Qaeda operation planner was apparently killed in a U.S. missile attack near the Border between Pakistan and Afghanistan this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials announced Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorists' top leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car near the town of Miran Śah in Sevverní Vaziristan province on Thursday, according to U.S. sources and Pakistanistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA in a zone of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were directed to a white car heading for the Afghan border when it was hit, said the official, along with a Pakistani intelligence agency on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said local militants rushed to the point and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness as saying somali was dead.
Somali was cited as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military operations planner who directed terrorist group operations outside afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in plotting around the world, said a senior official, who did not wish to be named, spokesman for the sensitive nature of U.S. air strikes on The Territory of Pakistan.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaeda's top leadership to plan possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somali was rapidly advancing in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known figure for some Americans, but he did not humiliate himself in any way to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban to be killed since September, when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the indigenous tribes and three other top poperative leaders, was killed in a similar attack.
The pace of drone strikes launched by the CIA has dropped from an average of about six operations per month to two since the summer, according to records from Long War, a website run by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have reason in the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing people they suspected of being informants, the site said.
The top United Nations delegate in Kabul has resigned.
The United Nations' top delegate in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would like to step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that has been thwarted by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed election of the president of Afghanistan.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the US timetable for the downsual, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the building of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian employees helping to politically transform Afghanistan.
The increase on the part of the armed forces must be copied on the part of civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but that he was simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to file a U.N. report.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
"As I said, it's high time we look for a successor," Eide said.
When I came here there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun a search for a replacement.
Officials said a decision was being made between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian descent and previously headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was impeached in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election, for masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied the allegations, but said the indictment of Galgraith -- who was released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed a meeting with the attorney general to coordinate relief efforts with U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also called on the U.N. leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, because he says he would like to strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of its efforts in Afghanistan, saying that cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermined its ability to use its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have only had the opportunity to get one person since May, he said.
This is a disaster, and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces more sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran because of a lack of engagement in talks over its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of areas where fighting is being fought in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likely development. ¨
One of the things that depends on me is whether I've learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [it] is inherent unpredictability in war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran's military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of those sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said a "package of incentives and inhibitions" would require "to make the Iranian government feel truly less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer extraordinarily" from sanctions.
According to a statement issued Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has warned European leaders that Iran will suffer serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the U.N. Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks to curb his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has been behind such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two sides and to give time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from interim agreements - partly because, the expert says, the Iraqi leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, as far as Iran's stubbornness towards the international community is concerned with some of the proposals that it actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think it has put the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to seeking other elections, including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, iran's mission to the UN on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" in front of some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an appropriate long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and iraq's Arab majority, mainly over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce their conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to allay Kurdish concerns about the continuing depression. U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzaani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity, and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to support more children" and "One more child means one more grave."
Then they learned that when official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and an aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We've always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn't keep anything for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China's more than 30-year policy of having only one child has been implemented, creating two generations of only notoriously chubby and pampered children, afflictedly nicknamed "little emperors," a population crisis threatening the country.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six before politics came into force, according to UN data.
The population distribution, where the population aged 60 and over is predicted to grow sharply from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. That's well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with a college-educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of shanghai's municipal commission on population and family planning, said many couples must have children to "help reduce the proportions of the aging population and reduce the workforce in the future."
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual calming
As enshined in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate introduced under communist rule to date.
Couples who violated politics faced huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials pushed for a policy that helped the country prevent critical use of natural resources, while human rights advocates were condemned in pursuing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortions with their second child.
Moreover, many couples had to undergo sexist abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have gradually been milder in their position on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exemptions -- including city dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were only children -- and in 2007, they softened the diction of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University's Population Research Institute, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced with copies of the regulation detailing how eligible to have a second child would be and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration sent family planning officers and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who chose to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
A sad response
Although officials in a rural town around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign began, most of the city's districts have not reported changes.
Huinan City District, with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number born in the city in 2010 is still only expected to be around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Shanghai's Caol Quarter, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people didn't want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a docial safety net, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjud down the one-child policy as a contentious legal issue, says Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, we were emousted from the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just politics.
It's about the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the center of attention of our families and everyone cared for us.
We weren't used to provide care and didn't really want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who own a translation company, put it much more openly.
For middle-class parents who have reduced the birth rate, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today's 20- and 30-year-olds view their parents as the rushing first days of China's experiment with capitalism, and they don't want this way of living for themselves, he says.
It's one child who places enormous demands on parents' time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the contentious questions of the propstor -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and strategies -- "You have to have a resumé ready at a time when the child is 9 months old for a good preschool upbringing.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher living standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The UN Group outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reachingly unruly attitudes and mutual reproach -- again focused Friday on releasing a document proposing ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But important progress has been seen in the negotiations that have taken place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by an ad hoc UN working group, this text subtly states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a variety of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so that they can limit their carbon output, and what should be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
This adds a lot of flexibility to the process, says John Coequyt, chief executive of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, made a 180-page text from the meeting to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture."
It outlines the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by the year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during that period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union urgently discussed a promise friday to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries accept adaptation to climate change -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Still, Friday introduced the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in last week's talks.
Todd Stern, the US special envoy on climate issues, rejected a speech calling for binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries compared to volunteering with major emerging economies if they were not financed by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line on China than bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accept the treaty without transferring major developing countries and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be vetted by external observers.
Stern made the comments an hour after China's Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told america's chief climate negotiator that either a lack of "common sense" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" led earlier in the week to say that the United States would not help China financially to deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, tug-of-war has erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about preserving individual economies rather than preserving the planet, between China and the United States over fulfilling their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that the world's two dozen most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take stronger action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of reducing greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent large issuers from being held accountable in their actions.
It's clearly a game about the new economic hegemony developing, said Ulate, who also serves as regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue pushing for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that a political agreement would be the best outcome of the talks.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the advances by small island nations "have triggered political pressure on the entire political process" partly because they are now united and demanding action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations created a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the remaining contentious issues before heads of government compete for an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as India's Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China's Deputy Minister, disembarked from planes and ran through the lobby of the Bella Center to the closed doors of meetings and new conferences so that they could set out claims to be assessed next week.
The sheer size of the rally - with 13,000 people moving daily from and to the convention center, guitar-playing activists staging ironic spectacles at night about the countries they thought had sent them, and hand-to-hand hand-to-hand on paper rather than e-mail -- dominated by a challenge.
Intensity is only an over-the-top: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and 60 heads of state earlier in the day.
We have reached high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Deputy Minister for Global Policy for International Conservation of Nature.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 140mph train redefined feelings this Monday
at 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness to mark the departure of the train, which revolutionised traffic in Britain.
The country's first high-speed passenger train will reach 140mph and fly from Ashford, Kent, to London's St Pancras, travelling 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes in boarding the first high-speed passenger train outside L.A.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland with London.
Neglected stagnant waters should reduce passenger and commercial transport times, and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties were able to gain for this vision.
But the dozens of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle over projects and fears of environmental disruption have now hampered the construction of Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a viable study, submitted its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
A new route to London's connection to the West Midlands has been proposed within five metres in urban areas and boroughs where the impact of life could be problematic.
In the open countryside, a final route was planned for 25 m.
HS2 also foresees three options for a large high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is Y-shaped confection, where one high-speed line should lead to the western Midlands.
The line should be divided near Birmingham with one branch passing from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle above Tyne.
One line should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the best-executed choice has been made," said the railway expert.
Once this is done, travel times between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 2,250 miles an hour, making the BRITISH network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already designed to carry 400m trains capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains could operate hourly on the London-Birmingham line.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Given the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be extended to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement the scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be made before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the net should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but on existing lines north of Birmingham, and maintain journey times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is seen as a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers pay £75,000 mortgage on Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the tory front bench holder in the House of Commons, was paid thousands of pounds by taxpayers last year for an orangery he had built in his constituency home.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living "on rations," increased his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-panelled extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, totaling hundreds of pounds a month, to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in a timely manner, so he was not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out the control of member expenses. Last night, Mr Duncan made his demands 'menohlo to be cleaner or simpler'.
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the area in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth around a million pounds.
There is a kitchen, living room and dining room on the ground floor, but the IRS has agreed that Mr Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a conservatory to the house, which is described in the plans as an "orangery".
Neighbors describe it as a "greenhouse for fun and entertainment."
Mr Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the latest mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the mortgage security of £271,406 from his London home to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Commons.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan claimed around £1,400 a month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than £1,800 a month.
The interest in paying off MR Duncan's RBS mortgage could not have changed at this time, suggesting that it was all intended to finance a £75,000 loan.
RBS's standard mortgage repayment variable fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, which it remained.
The latest municipal authority document shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim £1,250 a month in May this year.
Mr Duncan quit his job as shadow home secretary in September after a undercover official filmed him saying MPs must survive "on rations" following the expenses scandal.
"Basically, it's nationalization, you have to live on rations and you're treated like a s**t."
He said, "I spent money on my garden and entitlement and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his extraditions in May when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before being approved by the IRS, that it "may be considered excessive."
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit on Mr Duncan's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed £4,000 over three years.
When asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the Tax Office and subsequently Legg."
He added: "This is not a contentious issue of hiding and zigzagging or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's an absolutely straight line down, according to the rules, justified, and that's it.
This would not be possible in many other ways cleaner or simpler".
Come and see the cottage on brighton's coast with advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the dual enjoyment of creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas wheels as a theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1, when it allowed visitors to view the last cottage from 5.30pm to 6.30pm every day, and bishop's bread and mulled wine, provided free of charge.
Selected carols included Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the cottage featured the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a television marketing assistant from Hove, is a scholarship-free priest in the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion much more important to people in post-Christian society.
"Why, as a church, should we expect people to come into someone else's old building? I feel that the Church should come to the people and serve in a wake-up call.
"The idea of an Advent calendar in the cottages was created just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we have tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where hundreds of people were arrested by police on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, were protesting in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, president of the Climate Conference in Denmark, said that the growing global mobilisation, the clear proof of which is the current manifestations, has contributed to the "political toll" of any failure in Copenhagen being too high.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the procession, when a group of about 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, began smashing windows with cobblestones and hammers.
Riot police immediately intervened vigorously.
In total, police announced the arrests of between 600 and 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks," ultra-radical separate groups that had already emerged at a NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "in no way" and stressed that about 100 were "held in handcuffs and sea while seaded on Saturday night " despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A candlelight vigil was held for the speakers, attended by former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed their first rally in Copenhagen in the morning, at the invitation of friends of the earth, a group that wanted to create "blue waves" for a "just climate."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand an environmental debt settlement for the South, said Lidia Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't say anymore: it's time for that,' said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and watercourses are up, today we can walk in them, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement to fight for another world has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bová, one of the figures fighting for another world, said he came to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice." "At present, there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world ".
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, marched in red clothing and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters took to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazi elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "farce"
Abkhasia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, while Tbilisi called the move a "farce."
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to Abkhahazian Electoral Commission officials, turnout was 58% a few hours before polling stations closed.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapš, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which has condemned the elections.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhasia has completely fallen into Russian domination," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of the territory, with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, following the 1992-1993 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era for our independent state, Kvarchiya Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagachi, told AFP.
She was one of those who came to vote at a polling station at a school in the capital, Sukumi, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential election in this region on the shores of the Black Sea, which boasts beautiful nature.
Huge billboards with Bagapes are placed all over this small country of 216,000 people alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vadimiro Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the elections received a warm reception from district mayor Beslan Arsba.
"We Abkhazi are grateful," he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, toasting it with a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the elections by former Vice President Raul Khadzhimba and two businessmen, Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized contracts concluded with Moscow last year, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control Abkhazi's rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
Winning an election required an above-half majority of 50% plus one vote.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive contest must take place within two weeks.
Climate: world demonstrations, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at the Copenhagen conference, demonstrating around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000, have been protesting in the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, to agree an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession calmly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A candlelight vigil was held for the speakers, attended by former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP journalist, the incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing windows.
Riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, knocking several protesters to the ground.
In total, police announced the arrests of between 600 and 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks,"ultra-radical separate groups that had already emerged at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer on his jaw was injured by a cobblestone and four cars were set on fire near a squat near the incident, which police sources said had injured about 20 people.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while police helicopters took to the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed their first rally in Copenhagen in the morning at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, a group that wanted to create "blue waves" for a "just climate."

Oxfam has called several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothing and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, were manifesting outside the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
Several hundred demonstrators also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

Geography and history courses will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general grammar school, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview with JDD magazine on Sunday that history and geography courses will be "strengthened" as part of the reform of general grammar schools, even though their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the final year of a grammar school focusing on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week, and everyone will have the same program from general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "hypocrisy must be put to an end" because, according to him, specialization S is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "basically the best students in it."
The EC and L specialisations cannot be sub-specialisations for S, he continues, stressing that 'I have not heard many historians and intellectuals complaining that geography and history are not being studied in the final year of vocational grammar schools'.
An Ifop poll published by Humanité on Saturday showed seven out of ten French people (69%) disagrees with the government's project to abolish compulsory history and geography teaching in the S-specialty senior year, which is why many intellectuals and teachers have criticised the abolition, both on the left and some members of the right.
On the contrary, the Minister added that it is "out of the question" to abolish philosophy in the S-year specialization programme.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended reform in the education of teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against the project, which they say will sacrifice the pedagogical education of future high school professors.
As part of master's studies 2 (M2), they will undergo an entrance examination focused on their field at the beginning of the year and another examination at the end of the year to verify their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of master's studies and will perform as a professor-intern in front of the pupils for the first year.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission procedure, you will gain more experience with pupils, almost 300 hours, he continued .
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure university, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen summit: this is the call announced in the morning by Jean Jouzel, multi-president of the Intergovernmental Group of Climate Change Experts (GIEC) at the initiative of ecole normale supérieure university on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions from experts that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to learn more, 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of the seminar, explained at the conference, which was named after a fish from a local pond named after students.
About twenty contributing experts from individual scientific disciplines are selected and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
On climate warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke in front of 50 listeners without pre-prepared remarks, only using graphs, told AFP.
This is part of our scientific work, he stressed, in the hope that listeners will recognize that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific basis."
Videos filmed at these lectures will be posted on the school's website from 15 December.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February, and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Payment delays: angry prison guards, planned measures
The prison guards' union announced a "general mobilization" on Friday, demanding that bonuses and overtime be reimbursed by the Christmas holidays, which have been postponed until January for financial reasons.
The Prison FO (2nd Guards' Union) asked staff who would not be on duty to take part in a demonstration outside prison facilities on Tuesday morning to "block" them to warn of "wage theft."
The CGT for Prison Guards (the sector's 3rd trade unions) called on them to "convene rallies in individual prisons and initiate a major mobilisation", saying it was "shameful and unacceptable" that "overtime and surcharges for night, Sundays and public holidays" worked in October should not be paid in December.
The first guards' union, the Federal Union of Prison Guards (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a total mobilization (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and indignation'.
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime increased a lot in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a memo to the prison guards' union reassuring them that payment would be made next month.
I am well-known for the efforts made by prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the Minister writes in her communication.
I have ordered the Administrative Directorate of Prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation that arose from the poor evaluation of the number of overtime never happens again in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
So december's wage will be low, with the exception of executives who receive famous bonuses for performing their duties and meeting targets, Ufap/Unsa says, and for those "there is always room in the budget."
It is simply a scandal, the interregional FO union in Marseille has become indignant and announced its decision to boycott "all meetings and summonses" until further notice.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or public holidays unless they are reimbursed for these days from October, as well as overtime, the RHÔne-Alpes-Auvergne FO is also at risk.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and more tasks without having additional staff available to us, it is sad to allow the least-ranking employees to pay for it, says CGT-prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, funding is scarce, said Ufap Secretary-General Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives 'better gifts' for Christmas than the ones he gets
US President Barack Obama, preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided in "screen goddess" Oprah Winfrey that he has a simple rule when it comes to gifts: "I give better gifts than the ones I get."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will air Sunday night on ABC, about how they plan to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, gets his ass.
Baby Jesus also likes Bo, Michelle Obama said, noting that the dog will also "of course" get a present, according to excerpts from the show's pre-broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband's statement on the quality of gifts she receives: "No, I gave you nice gifts last year," teasing the president.
Well, that's true, of course, the president was forced to agree, but immediately afterwards, with humor, he pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous host, who was a strong supporter of Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the Obamas also spoke about their most unpopular donated as children.
Barack Obama introduced a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball given to him for Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he rarely encountered.
I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and how he gave me that basketball, the president said.
It wasn't until long after that I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The First Lady was reminiscing about the dollhouse.
I didn't know how to organize it all in the house, so I evened out all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday operated again, RTL reports he's in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated on in Los Angeles due to "injuries" sustained after a major surgery he underwent in France, but the situation is "under control," according to those closest to him, while RTL reported that the singer is in an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker underwent surgery again Wednesday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors reported "injuries resulting from surgery" on a prosthetated disc he underwent in Paris on November 26, his press office said in Paris, saying the lesions required "repair surgery."
However, the singer's press office sought to reassure the public, ediating that the situation was "under control" while announcing that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the main partner of the singer's latest tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications."
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll have a little more confidence, RTL adds.
The press department, when asked by AFP, neither confirmed nor commented on this information.
RTL also reports that according to "some sources", no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a slit disc.
The surgery, which had been scheduled several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL's information.
After the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection that occurred after the hit.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, told RTL radio on Thursday that his friend is going through a "bad time" but added that he 'isn't worried' about the rocker because he's a big "fighter."
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing something stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after an operation like this is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, reassured the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday was "responding well to antibiotics" and that the infection had been "stopped."
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a "small bowel tumor" and then a minor infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every one of his health problems has been closely monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists noticed that the singer had difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to re-report a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Prime Minister Bousquet in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time world champion at the 2009 World Championships in a large pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championships in a small pool in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: the 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championships, at which overalls are last allowed, only three world records fell, although many more were expected.
One of them was surpassed by Hungarian racer Evelyn Verraszt in the 200m position race and the other two men's relays of Russia in the 4x50m position race.
Great grief for Bousquet, who set a world record in the 50m freestyle, of which he already holds the big pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, where ten swimmers started instead of the regular eight.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (8.30pm) he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said if the world record was within my reach, I'd try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore overalls made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
The overalls have set 238 world records since February 2008, and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host them at the same competition in 1999.
The use of the jumpsuit did not help German Paul Biedermann, a two-time world champion in the big pool in Rome this summer, who had the world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the record he holds in the 400 meters freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything into that race.
I knew I couldn't break the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious contender for the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Romanesque sarcophagus plaque belonging to Zola auctioned for $1.5 million
A romanesque sarcophagus plate that was none other than french writer Emil Zola was auctioned off on Thursday for $1.5 million, significantly more than estimated, art dealer Sotheby's said.
The price of this two-meter-long and 63 cm-high front plate, dating back to the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
Marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural décor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants, is a rare work, there are very few such pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, Vice-President of the Auction of Ancient Roman and Egyptian Art at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it is the item most bid on, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Emile Zola's getting this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The plaque was in Rome for almost 300 years in the borgia family's famous collection, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated her bathtub with her in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before Marshal Petain came to power.
There it remained shaded for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered during a search of the Louvre museum database that the plaque was part of "Emil Zola's remains" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
A interrupted attempt to get President Zelaya out of Honduras for Mexico.
Mexico decided on Thursday that the conditions for the transfer of Honduras' dethded president, Manuel Zelaya, who had been refused a safe exit by the rebels, were not met.
After a phone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, all indications so far are that there is no way to carry out this transfer, said Mexico's Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinosa.
A Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya has flown back, a source in the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The coup d'ed who wanted to force President Zelaya to "resign" and apply for political asylum abroad would only give him the opportunity to leave safely.
But the dethded president rejected those demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as head of state in exile.
The coup d'ed who "experienced another setback when they wanted me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, often commenting on the political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here,' added the dethdate president, hiding in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and playing a few chords.
The Embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the interior minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not apply for asylum for any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Caracas-based Telesur.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the dethemed president on Wednesday, who came to gather around brazil's embassy, where the military has stepped up security.
Brazil's Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the coup government's stance.
They show their marginal stance on international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who became close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized public consultations in preparation for his re-election, against recommendations from the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge in the Brazilian Embassy.
If he comes out of here, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of "treason" for which he is accused, the coup government claims.
On November 29, coupist President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election to replace President Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo won controversial elections recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance urges optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday up, and U.S. trade balance results show a rise in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq gained 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved to 10,405.83 points from 68.78 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance of 7.13 points to 2,190.06, according to closing data.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy,' commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on a "half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focused primarily on U.S. trade balance figures "that show activity improving in the fourth quarter."
The United States' trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected the deficit to rise.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the economies of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
However, unemployment rose against all expectations in the United States last week, with the number of jobseekers reaching 474,000.
But in the last four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "to its lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market also fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year yield rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba : hundreds of regime supporters booed "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime booed the wives of political prisoners on Thursday, who had concurred in Havana to mark World Human Rights Day and prevented another rally at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About 40 "Ladies in White," wives or close political prisoners were booed in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's regime as they marched toward the center of the capital demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Down with the Yankees!, "Mercenaries!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted the regime's dissidents with a raised fist.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by plainclothes officers who came to "ensure security."
The day before, there had been a similar rally against "Ladies in White" in Havana, but there had been no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana's Vedado district, about 10 dissidents were detained by plainclothes police, who were also preparing to celebrate World Human Rights Day on Thursday, AFP reported.
According to this journalist, the police loaded dissidents who were booed by supporters of the government into civilian vehicles using force.
Arresting dissidents in similar conditions only takes a few hours under the rule.
The winners of the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, "Ladies in White," organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid for by their archenemy, the United States.
A miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday's rally by supporters of the government against "opponents of the revolution."
Cuba, with the Communist Party at the forefront and policy of one-party rule, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disrespecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman with a knife killed an 80-year-old man and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during rush hour on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary investigation results, the assailant, aged 28, allegedly assaulted an 80-year-old man at or in front of a pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures for unknown reasons, according to a version of police and witnesses.
The badly injured old man, born in 1929, died in hospital from his injuries, according to the Alliance police syndicate.
In or in front of this pharmacy, the attacker then attacked the pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, aged in his 30s, began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the other injured man is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs may have been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
The armed man, believed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still on Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two other people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How all this happened is not entirely clear, as it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried behind his back, the head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé, said at the scene.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to stop and disarm the lunatic, according to testimony gathered by AFP.
I saw a guy in his 30s in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commented Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
A crowd rushed in, including one city policeman who broke his wrist in the same time, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to apprehend an armed man while wounded with their fists, a police source said.
The incident took place on one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passersby came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went outside and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place and noticed a large wound on his stomach, Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person in his 30s came in with stab wounds to the knife.
The man, who was not carrying identity documents, was arrested by state police.
The Public Prosecutor in Nanterre referred the matter to the Investigative Department of the Regional Police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspected assailant was taken to a hospital Thursday night.
He's in custody awaiting questioning.
A police source has not ruled out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six officers to handle him at Clichy Police Station, where he was taken.
He was "completely out of his mind" as "all madmen of this type, whose power increases tenfold in action".
US: Polanski's lawyer again calls for an end to prosecution
A lawyer for Polish-French director Roman Polanski again filed a lawsuit Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to stop prosecuting his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that occurred 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the attorney for the director of "The Pianist," criticized the serious mistakes made during the 1977 trial before three judges of the Second District Court of Appeals in California.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and now, hummel's lawyer said, adding that laurence rittenband's behavior at the time "gave him a chill in his back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the mean time) was supposed to have been in negotiations with the public prosecutor before passing sentence, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information about this conversation appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and sought), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually claimed in late September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
If the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Hummel's lawyer will demand a trial in which he can present evidence of his claim.
The prosecutor reiterated what had already been said at the first state trial, namely that there would be no serious study of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski appearing in court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before the court ruled on "unlawful sexual intercourse" with an underage girl aged 13.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
In this case, do we want to tell not only Roman Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? Mrs Asayam asks.
He believes that the director "seeks kindness from the court while contemptuous of his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to take a decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape."
Hummel's lawyer wasn't the only one asking for roman polanski's prosecution to be dropped.
The victim's attorney, Samantha Geimer, also again called for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client could no longer stand the constant harassment every time the Polanski case came up, adding, "No one in this room can say that the trial was fair."
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a US warrant
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible eviction.
Wall Street ends in no direction, held back by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended Friday without a hitch, with the market tussling between better-than-expected indicators in the US and the rising dollar price: The Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced to 10,471.50 points from 65.67 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance, left 0.55 points and ended at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41.
Frankly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within a narrow margin, the volume of trade has decreased greatly and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators that "helped improve the market mood in terms of the stability of the economic recovery," analyst Charles Schwab summarized.
In the US, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the index from the University of Michigan, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising strongly in December to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month.
But indices were held back by a new rise in the dollar's price against the euro, which is the highest in two months, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
As a turn, technology stocks are losing ground.
The stock market has fallen.
The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3,540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and rose to 4.497% from 4.492% a day earlier.
The choice of Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month-long trip across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream of being voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
This big beauty celebration has been held around Johannesburg for the second year running, and so far five candidates have reached the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were chosen miss sport or miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real vortex of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences!, she confided to Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which is being held in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, from 5pm (3pm world time).
I couldn't have dreamed of a more beautiful country where I'd put on a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy to have experienced it twice,' said Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the rediscoveration of the country and its "breathtaking landscape."
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safaris, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Pooja Chopra, an Indian, hopes to follow in the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who is also in the race for Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman's dream, but it's not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to come home with a crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome a world with warmth that is hard to match, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
As last year, the candidates took part in safaris, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for a president, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the south-west of the country) for the World Cup, which will take place in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi with enthusiasm.
According to son David, the news of Hallyday's condition is "very positive."
News of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive," as his son David assured us on his arrival friday at Los Angeles Airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong and everything is going very well, david hallyday said as he got off the plane he flew in from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (9 p.m. world time)
The singer's son, who seemed calm, said he would be "as quick as possible" to the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted monday due to a postoperative infection following surgery on a sagging intervertebral disc he underwent in Paris on November 26.
According to a press release, the singer was "put into an induced coma" that night in Los Angeles for comfort to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday has already been put into an induced coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles. The hospitalization was due to an infection following surgery on a slit intervertebral disc in Paris on November 26.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again at night from Wednesday to Thursday .
According to an AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a french lyceo school performance in Los Angeles on Friday morning attended by their daughter Jade.
Yves Catoné, head of the department of orthopedic surgery and traumatology at La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, announced that she was flying to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer harshly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, M. Camus said.
"I've heard of the possibility of a future trial," he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes johnny hallyday "went too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon."
I spoke to the doctor personally by phone, and he assured me that this trip was no problem, which surprised me greatly, as I had already suffered from intervertebral disc prolapsis twice myself, he added.
Moments earlier, he had stated on RTL radio that the singer had apparently left after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well known in art circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was working at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma caused by a brain haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of medical malpractice, tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Medical Chamber, described him as a "man without scruples" who is "regularly" summoned to the medical chamber and who is "far from being recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux made the comments on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He said the procedure was "absolutely good" and post-op examinations were "normal."
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, so the introduction of a drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer's health problems have been growing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with a question mark.
It is clear that the date of the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (In Amiens) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre party not to use their acronym anymore.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançois Bayrou, responded on Friday to an attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre party, Herveau Morin, to appropriate the acronym of giscard's former party, saying that he must not use the acronym in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to appropriate the acronym UDF, saying that François Bayrou does not deserve to bear her legacy after he shook hands with the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
His move gained support from The Hervé de Charetto MP (formerly of UMP now for the NC), who credits ownership of the UDF brand since he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday night, a UDF committee run by friends of François Bayrou, who have no intention of being expropriated, broke his silence and made a formal request to both the minister and MPs to stop using the acronym and hand back ownership of the trademark, under threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have increased the alarming statements that you will propose to your political movement to +re-take over+ the acronym UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem party or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place the name+Nouveau centre+ on your promotional materials and on your movement's welcome website, with the slogan +UDF today+, the signatories of the letter also state.
As you know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF, which asks the NC movement to "immediately remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (its) website."
At the same time, it asks Herv de Charette 'to hand over ownership of the trade mark to legitimate owners'.
If you do not, we will go to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories point out.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a full-time political movement since 1978", recalling that Mr Morin and his friends "chose " to leave in 2007 " to form a competitive movement, as others did in 2002, to establish the UMP.
The Nouveau centre movement therefore has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join modem for three years and to create a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Herv de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark", he had been "not a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he used the nonexistent registration of an acronym to do so on his own account.
This indiscretion begins to turn into a crime, they claim, and then expresses irony about the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that, both in politics and in everyday life, it is more valuable to make a name for yourself than to come out of anonymity by fraudulently adopting a name to which we are not entitled.".
Liliane Bettencourt's case : François-Marie Banier will be tried for abusing a state of weakness.
A court in Nanterre decided on Friday to try artist François-Marie Banier and pass judgment on whether he used the 80-year-old billionaire's state of weakness to deprive her of part of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of famous people, will be tried on April 15-16, 2010 for abusing a state of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of €375,000.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in what can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter attack each other and fight over the management of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heiress and the main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by March 10, 2010, while also expressing whether Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness and in what period.
I think he's going to do it.
"I'll talk to her about the matter," Ms. Bettencourt's attorney, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for François Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It's excellent news(...). The expertise will show that he manipulated this old lady in need of protection (M. Banier), he confirmed.
It has been two years since Liliana Bettencourt's only daughter opened criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and know-it-all who she accuses of exploiting her mother's state of weakness for years to raise €1 billion in checks, life insurance contracts or paintings of masters.
Liliane Bettencourt, on the other, has always denied being manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of the lawsuit brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, friday's lawyers' trial turned into a family truth hour.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary expressing her mistrust of Françoisa Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt adds, according to her attorney, "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Françoise."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has once again found that the complainant's conduct is not justified, all the more so since a care judge rejected her request to initiate legal proceedings for her mother in those days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is perfectly capable of participating in the trial, not even in custody.
No one else will act for her," said marie-christine daubigney, the prosecutor's representative.
The court ultimately decided to rule on Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers' legitimacy at the time of the opening of the trial.
A managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence has been useless...
For more than a decade, the behavior of the management of large companies towards employees has been reminiscent of the attitude of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about co-workers identifying with the "values" determined from the mountain, as was the case before, when products that came from the ideas of factory technician heads had to be forced on the consumer.
By becoming a hub for business companies, the marketing revolution has aligned the market-conquering strategy in the right direction... although authoritarian efforts to impose products, different from customer preferences, return regularly!
Passive attitudes of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that mainly affects management cadres.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) active approach and ability to anticipate" and requires employees to make commitments that are completely contrary to the incomes of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a management revolution, which aims to put workers at the heart of the business as well as the client.
Relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees - will they contribute to a revolution in management practices?
I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to it as a priority after various turns... what she always did!
This is also because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most executives have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of universities for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For reasons of thought comfort, they acquire an old behavioral theory, now revived by "neurosciences" from the US and widely disseminated without much knowledge by scientific institutes and the media.
With the power to move the "levers" (sic) of executive involvement, a recent Ipsos survey on the Figaro.fr website showed that only confirming executives in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating basic insight into all management intentions and practices : For employees, commitments to the enterprise will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, this concept of employee motivation is dealt with only by studies motivationally functional analyses.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxa, which allows them, through the image that tells them about the business, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate, and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "on the right track."
This creates a breeding ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo: a "just war," Obama earned praise from the right.
On Friday, the American right welcomed a speech Barack Obama gave the day before in Oslo, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner was advocating the concept of a "just war" against America's enemies.
Conservatives who initially deeded Obama on October 9 applauded the president's speech, including Sarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
"I liked what he said," Palin, the muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had commented on the subject of "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs, which are currently being published.
War is, of course, the last thing the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists need to be apprehended there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, justified sending troops in Oslo on Thursday and used the speech to clarify his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another of Obama's opponents, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a "very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the President's reference to "the existence of evil in the world."
In a way, I thought it was completely historic, Gingrich said during an interview on "The Takeaway" radio show.
The former congressman, considered by some to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see a "left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they themselves would not be free to pass on the peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, former speech author of George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a "very American speech."
Not only did he present himself as a "world citizen" as always, but he "spoke like an American president" and reminded Europeans "that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves, and that they are not doing too much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few disgruntled on the right is a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "monotonous, pompous, and uninspired," as he put it on the National Review Online website .
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified at the sight of Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"If we wrap the war in the cover of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the middle-left press takes a commendable view of the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to consider awarding the peace prize to Obama premature, he has described his performance as "over-performance," even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, the fight against poverty and oppression," the California daily reports.
Obama "gave the speech he needed," the New York Times reported, calling the speech "simple and informative."
Road hauliers: three marathons to a deal that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathon negotiations, the road hauliers' union and TLF, the only employers' organisation left to the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the call for strike action and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "joy" at the signing of the agreement on Friday, following several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators broke up early Friday morning, hoping that the text of the agreement would be signed as quickly as possible by the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) have withdrawn from the negotiations.
But it took more than six more hours of the meeting, which began at 11:00, for everyone to come to an agreement and sign the agreement at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would hurt businesses greatly" and "there would be a risk that the end-of-year holidays would be disrupted," Bussereau said.
The text includes a wage increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
Hourly wages for the lowest salaries increase from €8.72 to €9.06.
It's not much, but there's a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're going to order our members to avoid blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was difficult to admit an increase in high salaries due to international competition ".
According to him, there will be an increase of EUR 170 per month for the lowest wages and €100 to €120 for the highest.
It is a common sense and respect for employees agreement, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement."
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise."
The agreement also foresees a revaluation of travel expenses of 3% and a report on the situation of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "€100 million cut in corporate payroll taxes" that was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill voted on by the National Assembly on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate for an "the same" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to companies that are members of this organization, later to the entire field, in the event of enlargement by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "as soon as possible," Bussereau assured.
Only the disapproval of employers' organisations can slow down the whole process.
FNTR speaks of "bad trade" because €100 million "has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency not as a result of mutual analysis, but to industry turkey eaters as the Christmas holidays approached, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement threatens to "bury a large number of SMEs in the industry" in the next 12 months.
RER A suburban trains: disruption at the weekend, unions dissatisfied with ratp transport company proposals.
Disruptions on the RER A suburban train line, France's largest public transport service, will continue over the weekend, as Friday's negotiations between the unions and RATP management on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results on the issue of premium demand.
On Saturdays and Sundays, the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only run between 10am and 8pm, with every other train running on the main section (between La Défence and Nation), with only one train out of four outside that section.
The connection with SNCF will be severed at Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette department stores, which expect over 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP has tried to connect with large department stores."
The RER A line runs from west to east of the Paris conurbation.
The RATP-managed section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one out of two trains were in service during rush hour, and virtually no trains were running during off-peak hours as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of the Ile de France had arranged differently, and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people than usual at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines), among other things, because pupils and students were absent.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29, of Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to make sure he got there on time."
Saint-Lazare station was not overcrowded, SNCF state railway announced, as a larger number of bailiffs and law enforcement officers were predicted.
RER A suburban trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or from Cergy-Le-Haut were coming or going from Saint-Lazare station with a metro connection.
Other general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to assess the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the leadership, which the union rated "weak."
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains in all aspects, working time adjustment, career progression, etc.
But that's not the point for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (UnionJih).
Ratp even postponed the premium proposals for the time being, which offended the CGT, saying that management "was unable to solve the problem while it was possible for the carriers and SNCF".
The new meeting, scheduled for Monday, will "examine the conditions of the profession further," ratp said.
Which is why trade unionists think the business is "making fun of weekend travelers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the company committee at its Paris headquarters.
The management, which until now had refused any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to meet in order to "calm down.""
The conflict is in danger of spreading to RER line B on Tuesday, after Unsa and The Independent reported a strike alert.
The unions are asking for a premium of between 120 (Unsa) and €150, of which 30 euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and are making it difficult to work on this line, which carries a million passengers a day.
Drivers of RER suburban trains earn between €2,200 and €2,700 in gross wages and €600 to €650 in bonuses for irregular working hours and for working on Sundays and public holidays.
Turkey's judiciary has disbanded for the Kurdish side, and this decision carries severe consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to abolish the country's main pro-Kurdish party. The decision immediately sparked protests in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may greatly complicate the task of a government that seeks to lend a friendly hand to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it became "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president, Ahmet Türk, and Aysola Tugluka, a member, are banned from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party leadership had already warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as politically affiliation MPs.
The decision is a continuation of a trial initiated in 2007 by The Court of Cassation Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is a legal political showcase for PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "basic connection" to the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court's verdict comes as the government shakes hands with the Kurdish community and offers a series of measures to strengthen their rights, attempting to curb Kurdish support for the PKK to end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that disbanding the party could lead to renewed tensions in the southeast of Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is being held in clashes with police have broken out in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is predominantly Kurdish.
Police used tear gas grenades and water cannons, while demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails or fired stones from slingshots.
Also in Istanbul, about 100 people demonstrated.
After the verdict, Mr Türk said the justice decision would only "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (of the Kurds) by banning the party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are against interference as a matter of principle.
It doesn't solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a complete blow to the democratic proposals initiated by the government, commented Ahmet Insel, a political scientist.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
Pretty crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of fes' winter technical services department.
But so that his employees can try and learn to master all the driving technology.
This could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
Over 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
Fes is following an accurate plan.
As soon as it snows nationwide in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, they will go to 20 so-called A-sections of the large-scale sprinkler, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian areas and sections with descents like Atzelbergstraße.
FES starts at 3:00 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to add about 1040 kilometers of wet salt, which holds better, within a maximum of three hours.
That's why the FES starts at 3:00 a.m. "to keep roads clear when traffic starts at work."
It's hard when it doesn't start snowing until 7.30am.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for sprinklers."
Only when it does not snow so much are there access and interconnecting roads, which also include Rat-Beil-Straße.
Side and side roads are the last priority.
Brauburger knows they're going to complain.
At 5:00 a.m., FES footmen set off, preferably cleaning up dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually can't take care of all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that monitors bridges from 10pm to 4.30pm, brauburger says.
As icebergs form quickly on them, sprinkler comes out as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
Cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two meters long and 1.50 meters high, ran on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short forelimbs with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, there would have been nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues write in Thursday's issue of science magazine that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent of Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window into the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about kinship, the extension and the prosthaic of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for trias deposits, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains from a total of five individuals.
The find confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Trias are very rare, most of which are found only individual fragments."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, for example.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is usually questionable.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizers were divided into three most important development lines: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor, as well as birds, "long-blooded" four-legger sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores Ornithischia (bird-eaters), such as Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original terrapod after analyzing Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, nesbitt says.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, researchers found evidence of air bags, which even the descendants of the theopods have birds.
Thanks to airy sachas, the breathing of birds is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theopod with air sauchers, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of huge sauropods later also had air sauropods and light bones, this useful innovation was probably already created by the common emer in front of both groups.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists infermed that lizsters appeared there for the first time.
According to this, three development lines were divided early and spread from South America to all continents that formed a single earth mass then as the supercontinent pangea.
The fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related therapies, would also speak for this.
The three can't come from one common, immigrant anceso, scientists argue.
There are believed to have been at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
One even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His hypothesis could put together a distorted image, because very many primitive dinosaur fossils remain preserved in South America, rarely found on other continents.
How dinosaurs proved that they evolved from a relatively rare minor lineage of the genus of reptiles to the ruling vertebrates on earth during the Earth's Middle Ages remains a puzzle.
During the Trias, dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizers and countless other lizsters.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species evolved, while relatives died out and the interface of the Triassic and jury.
The history of success did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been mass extinctions that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles didn't.
Or dinosaurs adapted better so they could push out the competition.
In any case, the history of success did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals that also evolved into trias and have lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list alsolists professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna and Berkeley, California.
Associate Professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen joined.
The police eviction of frankfurt's occupied Casino Goethe University has caused a worldwide uproar.
278 professors and teachers of Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disodiate" the presiding police intervention.
Because the walls and artwork were defamed, university President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied last week by striking students and lecturers cleared.
Five students were injured in the attack.
The damage, the signatories say, does not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching by students and teachers by police commandos."
The eviction represents an "unacceptable interference" with the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "unjustifie and criminalize protest" and distracts from the content.
The Presidium avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers call for a halt to criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support material damage.
Justified protest
The youth trade unions Verdi and the German Trade Union also solidarity with students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi's shadowy youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Meanwhile, Hesse's Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has defended the university's president and police advances.
We're grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said thursday at the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in wiesbaden provincial assembly.
We understand the protest, but we have no sympathy for vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and Linke saw it differently.
The CDU is taking painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of addressing the arguments and demands of the students, they were evicted.
Linke has filed a motion calling on the Home Secretary to report on police deployment.
New Silicon Valley
For years, it paid for a secret city inaccessible to western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a closely guarded site where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district of 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, is considered "Russia's Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers are located here.
Since September 2008, Greengrad representatives have established contacts with the Frankfurt Riedberg Science Centre - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been several mutual visits, and on Wednesday in Frankfurt, Zelenograd and Ridberg signed the "Protocol of Close Cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Vice Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Zelenograd Prefect Anatoly Smirnov, with Edwin Schwarz, the chief planning officer, signing for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and SMEs engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to take up the growing Russian market.
Russian scientific firms, on the other hand, want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large Sitronics Group and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be sufficiently prepared at all.
For supporters of the project, this is quite simply the 'new heart of Europe'.
well. The S21 is more than a station launch, more than a monstrous structure that plunges the capital of Baden-Württemberg into desperate construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was created from the spirit of the 1980s.
The head stations with tracks that ended in the city center were then considered transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as brakes on modern rail transport, because enormous time was needed to switch locomotives from the rear to the front.
Drive, stop for a while, keep going - that's how it should work.
And that's why the head stations are disappearing: frankfurt and munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly halfway along the trans-European rail line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan about "the heart of Europe".
Indeed, the S21 begins, although visions from the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Very ambitious planners themselves recognized that in the Hesse and Bavarian cities, the start of construction is almost unfundable.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, head stations no longer have problems with detours and departures.
Still: Stuttgart 21 starts, including the new ICE line to Ulm.
It was pushed through by provincial and municipal politicians.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state concern.
Urban planning, the project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we believe the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
The S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a huge increase.
Back then, there was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must primarily be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is much greener than lorries on the road.
But the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
More importantly, the S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros were to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for additional nodal points and bottleneces in the network.
Sixty major projects are on the List of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of a roughly 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this route has been built at a slow pace.
We'd have to put a lot of pressure on here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The Rhine Valley line will become the neck of a bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines airport ruling
The provincial government has left the Wiesbaden Provincial Assembly open to go against and have it revised by the Hesse Administrative Court (VGH).
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH ruling, economy minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today reasoned in writing that the State would have to re-adjust the night flight ban if the planned north-west runway of Frankfurt Airport were to be built.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as foreseen by the Provincial Government, does not correspond to the legally mandated protection of the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to seek a review of the ruling.
The opposition criticized the postponement and called on government representatives to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
Spd leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises to ban night flights before the election. Otherwise, it can be considered a "violation of the word".
It's bloody hard if you can keep your word, said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP's election slogan "We keep the word."
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbe's rebut claim, the provincial government is trying to get to its nightly flight by "distorting the law and tricks."
Precise legal control needs its time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction's statements on the ban on night flights have never been as the opposition has.
U.S. banks repay aid
America's crisis-shaken big banks are getting rid of state ties.
Bank of America repaid $45 billion (about 30 billion euros) in aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund on Wednesday.
Citigroup also plans to repay state aid, according to a report by CNBC.
Thus, the constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have occurred by accepting money - limiting bonus payments to managers and paying high fees.
Bank of America has procured $19 billion in net money from investors thanks to convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the money from her coffers, which were filled with, among other things, union sales.
On Wednesday night, the bank's chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, explicitly thanked the American taxpayer: The cash injection helped us through a difficult time.
The money institution took a hit at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the State by procuring money on the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, reported that the U.S. bank could announce a capital increase of about $20 billion as early as Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman would not comment.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley already paid back the aid in June.
Quick choice
It went faster than expected.
The network unveiled a successor just two weeks after the ZDF board ousted editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender from office.
Last night, the committee wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in berlin, was identified as the favorite.
But the station didn't confirm it - officially, so as not to pre-ed the trial.
However, it could also have played a role in the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter if the proposal did not pass the board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the committee.
The outcome of the vote was not known before the deadline for this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed on the board with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him. Brender's loss of his mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though it was to be expected.
The EU's majority on the board had already signalled a few weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The backlash against the editor was organized by Hessi Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that ZDF's watch quotas had fallen under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
Most recently, 35 state lawyers were involved in the debate, who view Koch's action as unconstitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About a person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957, in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romanticism.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey joined the ZDF, first to the heute-journal.
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor;; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 the head and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy at the ZDF; since then, head of the main studio of ZDF.
After Brender, who was voted Media Magazin Journalist of the Year on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional suit.
Koch's opponent on the board, Rhine-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the Länder should amend the state contract with the ZDF so that the intendant's personnel proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also refused to exclude party politicians from the ZDF's supervisory boards.
Brender's presumptive successor, Peter Frey, took a smart chess move to the board - heavily criticized for it in the immediate aftermath of Brender's removal.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both Schächter and Schächter could nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing face, and he could be elected by the board without suspecting that the party would be pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is already ranked among left-wing liberals.
Studying get rid of junk
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, culture ministers finally went to the Länder on Thursday: At a conference of culture ministers and university rectors, both sides agreed that there was a willingness to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: In principle, each study module should be terminated with one single examination.
In addition, the workload of students should be checked and a 'real and defensible rate' should be guaranteed.
To do this, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to create a more flexible common structural assignment for Bachelor's and Master's degree courses.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer tests
Since the start of student protests in the worm, culture ministers and university rectors have had winged words in their mouths about better study.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called accreditation board decided that the number of examinations would be drastically reduced in part: "As a rule, each module will be terminated with only one examination", says the 30-page report, which is intended to partially re-regulate the approval of study fields.
"A significantly lower exam burden," said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, "is to be stopped by a flawed development that has significantly reduced the difficulty of studying."
To do this, the "difficulty of study" in the future should be a "decisive criterion" in implementation.
Modules and contents 'must be rechecked hard' so as not to 'unnecessarily restrict students from
seminars'.
Students would be "entitled to a space that allows and supports their own initiative."
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, but also for existing fields of study after review.
These need to be "re-accredited" every five years – but this means that it will take until 2015 for all fields of study to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this throughout Germany and are subject to accreditation boards established by the Länder.
In October, culture ministers called on the Länder to "vigorously" act on agencies so that the content of the apprenticery was not too large and the examination regime was not strict.
In individual Länder, universities and higher education institutions have already agreed with the Provincial Ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate has promised additional resources for the further development of the Bologna Process.
With the money, higher education institutions should primarily pay for consultation programmes and study counselling, and strengthen examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the Higher Education Act to parliament.
According to her, only one examination should be needed to finish the study module.
The formation of studies should be even more flexible, in addition to which recognition of examinations from other higher education institutions should be guaranteed and the opening of a master's degree should be facilitated.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all fields of study in the country should be checked.
The government and opposition argued again on Thursday about the country's study conditions.
In addition to the praise, there was also criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Directors of Juso Higher Education Groups called for education policy-making not to take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the strike, "students as persons concerned should have a say in this."
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need student experience," she said on Thursday at a meeting with culture ministers with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Department of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: They are demanding a legal claim that would give any graduate with a bachelor's degree access to a master's degree.
Secondly, the Länder must ensure that there are enough bachelor's degree places available tomorrow for today's generation of bachelor's students with the best possible study conditions, said GEW Board member Andreas Keller.
The Länder must employ many more lecturers.
However, culture ministers have not commented on free access to Master's programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to and from Germany is nice, hardly any control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who, in this torn-out language piece, thematicizes the experience of the travel of a dissident who has gained freedom but has also lost his linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, lectured poetry at Frankfurt's legendary Goethe University in 1993, and has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum at Mousonturm in Frankfurt since 2002.
He caused quite a stir last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security act."
Apparently unsuited and besek, Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to cooperating in front of fellow Writers of Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as a secret informant for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts at recruitment are said to have started inconspicuously, not until 1971 at the earliest.
I am, Söllner continued, "someone who has not resisted sufficiently attempts at intimidation by Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent named Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary settlement with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and infamy of a political system based on control and smearing.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if you can tell from the current state of knowledge, just the perpetrator, but he is also a victim.
Secret Agent Walter played a role in the Securitate acts, Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, referentiary to the positive influence on himself as Secret Agent Walter.
"He was "squeaching" me at all the essential points for him, markel says.
He has a moral obligation to make this remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in this form and in front of this audience, but it is not a completely surprising admission of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Herta Müller wrote in July, when she read her own nudes, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for Securitate spies.
Those affected, it can be assumed, will speculate, and in some cases probably know which name is behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Other than in the domestic, in the meantime, a very certain inspection of stazi's files, the manipulation of the estate of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic awareness has been thwarted and restricted.
One of Birthler's offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securitate Ingredients (CNSAS), was only established in 1999, and the issue of the act has been rather lengthy ever since.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of files.
After the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, former Securitate bosses from Tiemešvár demonstrated that former Securitate bosses from Tiemešvár still have a great deal of influence.
She's said to be psychoses, after all, she's only been interrogated once.
The disgrace to power here has been expressed entirely undisced in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the Söllner case, as in the context of a cover-up, is the case of unavoidable questions.
Why now? Who's been hurt? The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession is to expect that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a desire for knowledge rather than guilt and shame.
It's more than a footnote to the genesis of herta Müller's nobel prize-winning work yesterday.
Champions League's suation deposit
It looked as if a clean-clad sales representative had arrived from a cute Christmas party at which the sports goods manufacturer was handing out sweets as new VfBr trainer Christian Gross boarded the summoned Mercedes C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight, accompanied by an orange-colored sponsor's bag. ¨
A man with a marked bald man had a strange town drive around for him.
Otherwise, he could drive alone - alcohol was not in play, and drunk with happiness, the 55-year-old was also not enough.
It's been a pleasant evening, but work will resume tomorrow.
Or it's just about to start.
In the words of only three days of the engaged Swiss: "We have reached the final eight", that is, in the Champions League thanks to a 3–1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: it will be a brutally tough fight against resunittion."
The "far more important task" is before us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance from the royal class in Mainč even on an ordinary league day.
And avoid obvious weaknesses again after three quick goals from Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The Champions League semi-finals (matches 16/17 + 23/24 February/ rematches 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of babbel's successor's trembling arrival will therefore be preserved.
Not just for the supposed healer, who gave insecure Stuttgart professionals confidence, commitment and joy in the game in a short period of time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be bolder, explained the soul healer Gross so simply sounding successful recipe, which, however, did not prove any effectiveness under the work of therapist Babbel.
He insuceded some magic, admitted Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes into football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't think possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weeks-long break caused by injury, became the best player on the field due to his dynamism, tried to describe the identified "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working practices of his new superior: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
It was obviously missing under Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate victory against a weakened substitute and completely overburdened defence of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before a nasty revival came after the 0-4 defeat at Leverkusen, Khedira reflects.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt pointed out that while one goal has been achieved this season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not out of the woods yet.
Heldt's 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, was due to weekend events that came to life in the form of a televised interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that others make, not Jens, Heldt replied to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He threw a weak lead to the board and decided to change coaches after pressure from teenage fans.
Lehmann also described the cancellation of his day off after matches as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "articulate pure egotism," Heldt replied, announcing the sequences for the goalkeeper.
I don't think both 40-year-olds are going to have any more joy in life.
In any case, they agree with the others that without the work of a deposed coaching team, it would not be possible to put on such a strong and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had a "big part in the success," Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.
Heavyweight Championship match
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked with the words and gestures of world champion Vitali Klitschko.
However, after 12 tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his WBC heavyweight title.
The referee's verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson by unanimous vote on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
It is Klitschko's third successful title defence since his return in October 2008.
Before that, the Ukrainian was twice world champion of the WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't go the way everyone expected.
Klitschko improved his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, being beaten twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern arena, the 2.02-meter-tall Klitschko ran the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, 11 centimeters smaller, who had announced the end of Klitschko's era before the duel, was withdrawing from the world champion's punches, so Klitschko could not strike the decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In total, passive Johnson did little for the challenger and was just trying to get into the next rounds.
Klitschko provoked with words and gestures, but his punches rarely hit the world champion.
Still, he is only the second boxer since Timo Hoffmann in 2000 to fight Klitschko for a full 12 rounds.
The challenger caused a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko as a "hideous zombie" who "doesn't do anything right."
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion was provoked, pulling sunglasses off Johnson's nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Klitschko remained undefeated after his fourth fight on His return on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he defeated The Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his "own" WBC belt, which he had to hand over without a fight before.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in defending his title and Chris Arreol of the United States in September.
I only got one punch in this fight and physically I'm in good shape,' Klitschko said of his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the WBO and IBF world champion.
But The WBA belt is worn by Brit David Haye, after he dethroned 6-foot-13 Nikolai Vulayev in November.
Haye withsteed a fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
He is reportedly planning a showdown against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Greens leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar over meddly information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodore zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said "knowingly false" about the deadly bombing of two tankers in September, Greens leader Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday's ARD news program "Tagesschau."
Let's call it the usual expression: He lied.
The killing order was issued in violation of international security support force (ISAF) rules.
That is the essence of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it emerged that the attack was not just about destroying hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
Up to 142 people were killed or injured in a US airstrike requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to a NATO investigation.
On Saturday, the Greens, SPD and Linke called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to make an immediate statement before the Federal Assembly and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Bundestag's Afghan policy - and, if the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved the new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast have called.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor's office has no influence on the bundeswehr's specific deployment in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised about the ministry's account of the background to the dismissals of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background to the tanker attack.
It was officially stated that they should have denied the existence of NATO reports and withholded sensitive details from the Minister.
However, it was reported from around the two top officials that they had even alerted the Ministry of Defence to several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein in charge and one report from the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert should have asked for clarification in a letter in the meantime.
It is noted that it has not yet received any reply.
The Ministry did not comment on the resentncies on Saturday, pointing out that this would be dealt with in the Bundestag's investigative committee, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in a alert state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only the mentally ill or drug intoxication that connect the lines between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround our wildest fantasies and fantasies.
But those who experience dream states in vigilance, see and hear things that others do not see and hear, in today's Western world, pay mostly for a fool or a drug addict, or at least as a weirdo.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
Our imagination is to blame: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality merge here and there.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusions.
But while the initiator and effect may vary, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of deliriousness, psychosis, and hallucinations can be inferred from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed, and interaction between different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity doesn't have power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has kept philosophers and doctors busy since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in a vigilant state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "a great similarity of delirious with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusion, deception of the senses".
It's the fall of 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and gaudy colored.
Gravity has no power over it, hovering at the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, prized teeth.
They're homing him, kicking him with heavy, fiery shoes, throwing him against walls, feeling pain all over his body.
Loud, bad voices threaten from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer stand voices calling him names and insulting him.
Henning T. rips two cables out of the stereo, loops them and fixes them to a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and puts a noose around his neck.
jumps.
The loop loosen.
Learn, the chorus voices tearing his eardrums, "go to the clinic and get treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD started.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, besides he is manic-depressive, he takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
"In psychosis, I experienced the worst fears and deepest doubts," he says.
Ghosts are a terrible fact
About one percent of people get schizophrenia at least once in their lives, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the afflictions usually can no longer distinguish the inner and outer worlds, they are put in an over-awakened state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Hearing voices is particularly prevalent - voices that order, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations aren't uncommon.
The affected person is not able to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, the psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
Perceptions of reality in psychosis are focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief medical officer of the Department of General Psychiatry at the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has meaning directed at him.
At the same time, it gets into a passive role, becomes, as in a dream, over-emased by events and cannot actively shape them.
Therefore, schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible with them, ghosts are a terrible fact, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucinations
But, as Fuchss says, "the sensory and spatial structure of the reality one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience occurs in a real framework.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why exactly our brain does such cartwheings.
States of emergency can lead to a short-term relationship with reality for every person, fuchs says.
But not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that the affected people have minimal brain damage.
It is believed that at an early stage of development, neuronal maturation of the brain will be damaged, for example, by viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a puzzle how the neuronal system malfunctions, which has not manifested in any way for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis if there is a disposition to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, since they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains get jammed
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusies as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and deluses for ten years, last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (Unrealistic World in Our Head).
Hallucinations are typical accompanying events of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as borderline personality or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma are also common.
Surprisingly, even the brain of a healthy person hallucinates under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Ka kanan, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or too suppressed; if our brain boils, or if there's no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries about love or other exceptional conditions.
In more recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported experiencing hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to a grammar school there.
A perfectly normal girl, actually.
If it wasn't for the shapes and the voices.
At breaks, she may be approached by a wheeled man with long, dark hair.
When she answers him, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her can see or hear this boy.
This shy girl considers a uptight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
He's awake, he hears and he sees the boy, just like he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the pew.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It feels good, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, he sometimes asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusies are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are rather daunting
Often delusies are a burden.
When she sits in class, she can't watch classes many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new classmate, but he explains the mathematical equation audibly and visibly to everyone else.
At night, the appearances are rather daunting.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which rarely and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or asleep, whether the images she sees, grimaces, or a girl with bleeding cuts on her hands and feet arise before her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends anything about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Deluses are also art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or has their stimuli taken away, they are very likely to hallucinate, Kasten says.
I don't think the brain has enough jobs and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she's called dad since she thought she wasn't her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain regions that also process real sensations and sounds, it is difficult for a person like Sarah K. to distinguish delusions and reality from each other. "Every experience," kasten says, "takes place in the brain, and reality is shown there.
Hallucinations are also images that give rise to the brain, which is why it feels so real."
Also, night dreams are evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to rate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Borderline state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world concentrated too much on consciousness, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief medical officer of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic at Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, suffering disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - the miring is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard explored the so-called oneiroid form of experiences, a special form of altered consciousness to a dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person concerned considers real and cannot even distinguish them retroactably from a alert state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps by a continuing, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, schmidt-degenhard says.
Kind of borderline state between dream and hallucination.
Because it is not possible to manage a situation in reality, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will become present in the imagination.
An intense form of sense support and sensory transfer in some unbearable situation that allows us humans to have our own ability to form, to transition into loss of consciousness in an instant.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of Hearts) as a lifeske of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness embarked on a multi-day journey, with his body lying motionless in intensive care.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he had created, visiting alien times and places: He becomes an old man bedridden, in a train sanatorium, a robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, who produces intoxiable substances from blood.
On a motorcycle, a Greek kidnaps him to his homeland, surfs a firn in the Alps in a hospital bed, and meets a Korean mobster.
It delves completely into the imaginary plot, everything is real, even later in the memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
A dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast to dreams, memories of those mental journeys are still clear years later and in irrelevant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other real experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, they show the oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxications, how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in a vigil state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, kasten summarizes, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be rewarding.
Snow may come
Burda
Children are due to take over the publishing house at 27
Kallen's new head of publishing is a transitional solution: Hubert Burda wants to put his business in the hands of both children in the long run, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding is to belong to a family of 100 percent in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says 69-year-old SPIEGEL.
We've been working out the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked only afterwards.
Even the question of whether they have the skills to do it.
It is not possible to put 7500 employees in charge of their children if they are not sufficiently capable.
That would kill both the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that it was withdrawing from the board since January, naming Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, the Treasury department added responsibility for the company's assets and, following the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, Direct Marketing, Foreign, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are in charge of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, now 42, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," Burda said.
The holding should still belong to a family of 100 percent in the future, Burda says.
Regarding the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses are not sure of extinction: "It has always affected companies that have been infected by a desire for capital that they have speculated and thought they can become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power," Burda says.
I don't see me as a political preceptor of this country like Springer, and I don't want to play in the World League with Time, these deals are too big.
Comprehensive beauty care
Everything you can wish for in the area of beauty and well-being is at your fingertips.
This was set up by El Corte Inglés, which has just launched a more than 1000 m2 Callao shopping centre in Madrid, which provides a variety of body care services.

Christmas is coming up, and this is the time when it's a good idea to find out what celebrities wear and customize their festive wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to accentuate the figure, which must be noted.
We make some suggestions.
Singer Fergie opted for an extravagant and very complicated cut. Isn't recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with Barcelona City Hall, founded the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the Catalan capital.
LIVE' (Electric Vehicle Deployment Logistics) will establish and manage the road plan for the introduction of electric cars in the city and will secure mobility agreements, handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
All in all, the purpose is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government under the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Region of Catalonia.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa in promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects, e.g. in the european development of the european standardisation team. G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'quiet period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that Spain's car industry, the state's main export sector, is in for a "quiet period."
In the Prime Minister's 2009 economic report, Zapatero summarised the measures that were put in place during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitive Plan for the Automotive Sector, we would have had a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing businesses," the Prime Minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a period of calm is foreseen for the future for this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, it stated that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), had identified EUR 800 million for projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries that mobilised an investment of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernisation of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's measures to support the request and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is implemented in cooperation with autonomous regions and car brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed the average emission level for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, namely by "40% in November."
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Salon will open in Madrid, a space for meetings of professionals and amateurs from the world of motors.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of Madrid's Casa de Campo.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, where more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious people.
Among the companies involved will be the following: Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialized mercedes benz company.
Outdoor aptitude tests
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding camps, sports performances, fitness tests, presentations and auditions.
Eligibility tests will also be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in a customized circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining a sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative effect on sportsmanry.
That's why the Mazda3 has a built-in engine stop and start system - also baptized as a stop-, a device that is currently only available with a 2.0 150 horsepower gasoline engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics, which it achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent with Mazda3.
The front seats, incl. the driver's seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely fine.
Using a tool assembly and console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and controllers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partly reminds us of the style that also presents the Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that both the Mazda3 and civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, more specifically, with theVolkswagen Golf that everyone wants to beat.
As is usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention the large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
So far, the automatic engine stop and start-up system is only available with a two-litre petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-speed handheld transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most popular Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive so many kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the lane monitoring system (RVM), which prevents blind spot, thrust and stability control, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirror, large-screen on-board computer, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and wheels made of 17-inch alloy.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an additional fee of 1,500 euros: adaptable lights twoxenone and BOSE sound system with CD holder, among other components.
conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most complete cars of its category.
It is characterized mainly by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
Moreover, people who do not drive more kilometers per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a gasoline engine2.0 and 150 hp.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is 21,770 euros for the Luxury version and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, mazda3 offers us a great deal of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. has a red carpet, soft as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in the brand's new chic and sexy 'Nine' models. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose a dark 'lady'.
Promise FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is used only for viewing mail, without the possibility to view a certain type of attachments or surf the net.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine recognized him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid, for example, for an iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began offering two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, for which it is necessary to pay six times the amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday at Le Web, is a European version of the invention and its third transformation.
He is limited, like his American counterpart, but he brings surprises.
The monthly maintenance price is about 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People travelling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or impatiently search for a café with WiFi (or Fon connection) to view the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics to understand them, as well as very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly calling for roaming tariffs to be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device such as FonPeek (interestingly, it continues to be called Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and are considering different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and paid for when purchased, not after months.
And this is exactly what I expect to happen one day in the case ofFonPeek, it is a possibility of purchase with permanent access as Peek already has it introduced in the USA.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the consumer's point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The color michelle adores
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
She chose a dress and coat in this color for Barack Obama's ascens as US President, the same color she chose when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: except that it is a similar color - yellow-green with glittering effects-, in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat of the same fabric- decorated with large embroidery or a collar.
At first glance, the First Lady of the United States seemed to have decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar outfits.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes the two models very different.
On the occasion of her arrival in office, Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
They also change accessories: green shoes with medium-high heel, now similar to the model, but in gold color.
She also wears different hairstyles: this timedrdol, previously loose hair.
75% of working mothers have maternity-related work problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and Careers of Spanish Women', carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
9,737 women aged 15 to 75 participated in the study, and the results are unequivocal: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to maternity.
The study highlights that at the beginning of cohabitation there are many differences of opinion on the number of children depending on whether they work or not, as well as the type of employment.
Women who do not work away from home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with a partner earlier, give birth to their first child earlier and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, cohabitation and motherhood, are putting off, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between the age of 35 and 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years after starting cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted a greater part of their lives to their stable employment and have therefore had to postpone cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, although less influence on the time of starting cohabitation with a partner", explains Margarita Delgado, researcher at CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage and the anaroar of the offspring is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35 to 49 age group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or high education do the opposite, preferring to get a stable job before marriage and the birth of their first child," delgado says.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal motto 'Because I am worth it'.
'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, joins other famous figures from The Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before that, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire') joined this select club.
The men's section of this cosmetics brand is also represented by notables:Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelina's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most prominent representatives - designers and models, past and present - gathered at the annual awards ceremony in London, atroyal court os Justice.
No one missed the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted best model of the year.
Manuel Vicente's Poker
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in everyday life) in 'Ace Poker' (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent spares no ficing or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading pleasure, even when read repeatedly.
Here are some observations.
On Albert Camus: "On the pages of this book, I have found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be named: the enjoyment of the counter-suate, the morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
Of Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, meaningless, as if it were the blade of a knife that nearly killed him."
On Graham Green: "Our man has been surrounded by passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege for reaching heaven through damnation."
On James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8,000 peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the northern side, from which the best climbers often collapse."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
In itself, he said he was the heir to a county landowner, other times he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, these were great dreams."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured on the bridge the deranged cry of this man from Munich to bring his echo into the night of the XX century in his literary form, running from himself and calling for the future and talking violently to worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "She once knelt down and prayed, 'Oh, my God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad: "Spenser's verses were engraved on his grave: 'After effort comes the dream,/ after the storm a calm harbor,/after the war rest,/after a full life death."
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
Her husband completely agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with folly."
On Pio Baroja: "What was Martín Santos up to but focusing Joyce on Baroja?
What was Benet's point but to have Baroja executed with Faulkner's gun?
What was Celo's doing but make himself famous at the expense of that man's fame?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of 15- to 18-year-olds walked past and our dog, a hybrid rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, kicked and seriously injured twice without a word.
Our indignation is all the greater because we see nothing amusing in such aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which was also on a leash.
And on top of that, the old lady's shock after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, began to fear for her own safety, for such a devil-obsessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone weaker than himself.
It happened at 5:00 p.m., Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have lodged a complaint with the nearest commissioner, but we doubt that it was of any use, and in order not to raise delicate questions, we note that these cowardly killers were Spanish nationals.
Indignation has prompted us to report this fact.
We don't understand what happens to today's youth when they have fun tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We don't understand where proper breeding, respect for animals and people went.
Michelin and Fesvial together for using helmets
Tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, both of them reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to emphasise the importance of the use of the helmet, as it is the only means by which head injuries or even deaths in the event of a motorcycle accident can be avoided.
Michelin states that this campaign forms part of their transport safety commitments, which "means more than designing and producing even safer products", and confirmed that it seeks to fulfil this purpose in other ways, i.e. in the form of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets when riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be placed with signers to reach the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety is 'a constant problem' for the company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main objective is to continuously improve product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles increase
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November accounted for an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what's more, the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the patronage organisation of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam dealers.
However, it is better to quarantine the favourable figure, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and marked a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles belonging to the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-up trucks, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
Nor did the smudge that most damaging demand disappear, even if it was bought by private individuals, most purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized firms, and in 100% of cases it is financing through third parties.
Other factors, such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation, should be added to the constraints resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In the given situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of the 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention persons who are doing business on a trade licence of small and medium-sized companies that intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reiterated the need to pay particular attention to the management of these vehicles, as well as to industrial cars (trucks and buses).
The Dealers' Association expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to calculations sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
The auxiliary system for handbrakes is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock braking system, it will also be with esp stability control, auxiliary handbrake systems, all this will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment for all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while others have a deadline for eliminating the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measure introduced in the EU aims to increase pedestrian protection, working in such a way as to help prevent many collisions.
The handbrake auxiliary system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects when the driver presses.
But it doesn't always manage to keep up that pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by car parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not hit the brake before the collision, and half of them did not fully use the brake force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU alone, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1 100 pedestrian-related fatalities per year could be avoided.
Reducing this number will be even more significant-according to calculations, one in four accidents affecting people-after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) will catch obstacles and report them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be avoided, the device will act as intensively as possible on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, warns Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April -probably April 8, as Javier Ortega reported, the AMERICAN manufacturer warns that it will take more time to meet Opel's recovery plan.
Nick Reilly, gm Europe's new president, is trying to get every point of the plan to be agreed with the party involved first.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that a decision to sell Saab should be taken in those days.
No wonder the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the US producer to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian Converg Group.
If it is not possible to reach an agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to Baic, a Chinese company.
It remains in effect, determined to close Saab at the end of the year if it fails to sell.
Driving a Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a foundation and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
On the basis, first of all, the automatic retractable roof is in a canvas version with manual control, thus reducing the weight by 21 kg; aluminium doors such as GT3 were also used, which means an additional 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; the reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres also contributed to a further 7 kg weight reduction; after mounting sports seats another 12 kg, thanks to lightweight 19-inch wheels of another five kilos.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means an additional six kilograms less, and replacing the door handles with textile handles means an additional kilogram.
Also offered with a PDK dual-clutch transmission, one vehicle with a hand-shifted six-speed gearbox has been tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain sections with many intricate turns.
His behavior can only be classified as inviolable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle does not press towards the asphalt.
On the contrary, we have not tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which would also transfer such safety when moving around a bend, even at high speeds.
He's a small athlete capable of warming his muscles on a short ride for the necessary time until we order him to sprint, brake, and resume engine use...
Whatever we want. With a steering that's as communicative as accurate, whatever we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he's going to do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, about 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very good and can be enhanced by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used at Panamera.
The capacity of acceleration is brutal, whether during suction or recovery.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we drive through with the Boxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and yet in some corners we encountered icing and gravel at dawn even in an advanced morning.
Finally, this ultralight car is one of the funniest on the market, as it is little more than just a boxster S modification.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.

Basquesa wins in Israel
The labour box office earned a brilliant 82-91 victory on its guest appearance on the complicated Maccabi Electra pitch, despite numerous absences from Duska Ivanovice's squad, and thus took the lead in its group after a big performance by Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triple points was named the best in the squad (29 ratings).
The Vitoria squad was able to make up for the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although they had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the great accuracy from the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match began head-on for the blues, who had stood on the mark from the start.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from afar already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli squad very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the leading scorers 18-20 at the end of the first period.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team opted for barac's inside play and the work of Eliyah, who was received with whistling and applause on his return to his original position to increase the advantage before the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to show up as the best in his squad with 13 points, although 'no six' in splitter's assessment already suggested that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilian.
But even though the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Maccabas wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone was winning on their pitch, and they managed to win 'by the hand of Elias'.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the 'yellow' returning to the top of the game (50-49).
More inappropriate
Ivanovic, injured but not dead at all, needed a few precise plays to catch their breath, and then came mirza teletovic, who made three triples in a row and, with the help of English and Ribas, restored the score to a reassuring number (54-67), which was achieved by the locals at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alavs took their skin off in the final period, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow their well-deserved results for the first 30 minutes to be taken away.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best on their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter ruled out for a foul, the SeIvanovics did not have a hasty and defended well, and although the Israelis came close to the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner and The Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost heavily to Olympiacos in Greece, leaving him in charge of Group B in the Europa League in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but mainly by an internal game(Freeland, Lima and Archibald) that facilitated the Greek victory.
Malaga's squad did not shy away from the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, or the rival, perhaps one of the sinister in Europe, and on a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusian to dream. Aggressive defense and three consecutive triple-doubles, two thanks to Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, lit up the field with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaya , although the arsenal of locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when a fight between usabeverley and williams supporters meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek squad began to function and proved their superiority in both zones, where the absence of the English pivot due to joel freeland's injury and three personal mistakes by Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja squad
Between the inside players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with triple points, they increased their advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very attacking for Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, proved superior and even managed to even the difference from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shook up the lead in the group.
Unicaja struggled to overcome the absence and last absence of Scotland pivot Roberto Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the downsides, Unicaja, thanks to Cook's lead and triple points and Lewis' contribution, left some hope of a 66-57 win, a minute and a half on 31 December.
But it was virtually impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and the prevalment in centimeters in his zone, prove that he was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to level the match at 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja withered to give Olympiacos the lead.

During the week that the app works, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels poorly rewarded," Albert Rivera, responsible for Trovit, explained in his report.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the lowest paid.
The British programmer takes 45,226 euros gross per year and the French 31,059, while the Spaniard gets 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, spain has the lowest paid waiter's job at €11,592 net per year; followed by a salesman with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most wanted jobs on the network in the last three months are a driver, a part-time job and a social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to remain at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been hiding since September 21, by that date.
"He is aware that on 27 January, after the end of his mandate, he must leave and seek another refuge".
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the november 29 elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya refused the condition of political asylum imposed on him by a "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in an environment where executives make decisions about a future that is uncertain in itself.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilise the market was to monetise debt by directly purchasing assets and indirectly to free up liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could purchase assets for sub-payment.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are practically over, and without questioning their disparate liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw a little sand into the gears, as the Bank of Spain did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in the return of the reduction in risk yields.
The stock market's mobility and bond differences have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, they are pushing for quality, and the US, Japan, and Germany have become havens chosen by investors, widen the differentiation of eurozone countries from Germany.
Spain was almost unstriced by this instability, but at that time Standard &Poor's came in and threatened a new revision of the Kingdom of Spain's downgrading.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useful in silencing moral risk advocates who have once again tried to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy by reining in the devastating effects of credit restrictions on employment when, in fact, a new Thanksgiving would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal struggles between the emirs to restore power in the emirate, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides the deficit, elections, and a new government is coming in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
There is no point in Ecofin rescuing Hungary from non-compliance with foreign payments at the beginning of the year and allowing a euro member country not to fulfil its obligations.
But what makes sense is that Ecofin should force the Greek Government to be transparent and to hold its own citizens to joint responsibility, while requiring extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of a period of normalisation of premiums from transitional risk, after some excesses in supported positions, they would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase in the same way as european companies' bonds, we need not worry.
If Europe's differences are reduced and ours continues to wide, this would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard &Poor's thing is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 upswing scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, this does not leave the Spanish economy much hope of meeting this warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "be careful, driver friend."

Iberdrola President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene yesterday in front of the chamber of deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed.
Following his intervention, which was followed by a speech by Gas Natural-Fenosa's president, Rafael Villaseca, Galán made a few comments to the press about the proposal he put forward to the subcommiss behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of €50,000 million by 2020 and another €60,000 million from that date until 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are retained.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that over the next decade, investment must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections
From 2020, the question is changing and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that a new 18 000 MW is needed, but with other 'support energies'.
Galán, who believes that the draft sustainable economy law just passed by the government corresponds to the line the company demanded, did not want to run a vein like a royal decree in support of the consumption of national coal, which is contrary to the policy of combating climate change.
In his view, there is a "clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "precise" measures, as President Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, albeit long-term decisions, must be taken now, because they continue to ripen and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of preferential partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at the 10 European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, from which economic deadlines have not yet emerged, is valid for five years.
Ferrovial, the Junta of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a cooperation protocol to create a Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association expects to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% is ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to research energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona aims for its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water company.
The construction in question is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5km tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option forAcciona to settle in the country as a construction and concession highway business.
City Hall wishes to have the tunnel completed by the end of 2014
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to initials in English) for further development of the project in a business plan backing Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and operation of tolls.
Bids are expected to be submitted in May, with an estimated investment of 1.700 million Australian dollars (€1.047 million) and three groups with significant presence in European constructions competing in the final stages.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies, and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe's largest underground construction specialists.
Against Acciona, northern direct group with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final group that has passed through the network is named LBRJV and is owned by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and a major civil construction firm Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises big construction and privatisation, but it carries with it a clear difficulty to enter in a way other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for spanish giants in the sector, in addition to Asian references.
ACS gained a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of Leighton cited.
Million-dollar assets
Acciona bets on the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier business and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of businesses that build and manage a $700 million desalination plant in Adelaide.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The toll underground route, which is being promoterd by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority, called the Northern Link, is to connect the Western Freeway from Toowong to the Kelvin Grove round-trip (see map) of 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the biggest action to reduce Brisbane's congestion.
The calendar set by the local government plans to be commissioned for summer 2010 and work will begin in December next year.
Although this paid transit would open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the works is not planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia is still delivering a significant profit for Hochtief, as it announced a deal with the government yesterday estimated at $154 million.
Share ACS will operate the national network infrastructure with fibre optic cable through its local Leighton branch.
This situation will allow 400,000 people to quickly access the Internet and provide work for a German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the 27-storey King George tower construction project in brisbane, Australia. Construction work was yet to begin, and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will work with Laing O'Rourke to build and operate two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC allocated $64 million tunnel in Slovenia
The FCC, through its Alpine branch, received a €64.5 million allocation of a 2.1-kilometre tunnel construction for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company won the contract a few days after carrying out work on the expansion of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore gets an ad in Renfe

Fine 63 million forFrance Télécom for hindering competition
France's competition regulator fined France €63 million for anticompetitive behaviour in the country's Caribbean regions.
According to the institution, the operator reduced competition for fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the margins of regulation.
With this penalty, the former French monopoly and still a state-owned company has bought up more than €560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the office that oversees the competition considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a relapse.
App Store
On the other hand, the Mobile Branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League brought in 476.4 million Madrid and Barça from the outset
The Champions League has become a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since made 476.4 million, making them the third and fifth highest-earning clubs in the competition.
Manchester United are in charge of the list.
Manchester United are in charge of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not just about glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
To the extent that the competition distributed €5,362.5 million among the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament began in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The White Club was third on the continent with the most money it received for participating, and the only one with AC Milan to win the grand prix three times.
The Catalan reigning champion and the last winner of the defunct 1992 European Cup is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also charged the most money to participate in the last Champions League.
Even though she lost both to Barça.
Spain, on the other hand, is only the third country to win the most money through the Champions, despite winning the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money distribution procedure used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to make 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will donate 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
in addition, those who participated received €3.8 million for their presence only, in addition to an additional €550,000 for each match in which they participate.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarterfinalists3.3 million.
Each of the last four gets $4 million.
The champion will make $9 million, while the runner-up will make $5.2 million.
In this way, the club will make a minimum of 7.1 million in fixed payments and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça, on the other hand, received £2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, however, there are variable payments for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four attributed places.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches to be played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% Sos
Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday released details of a share buyback bid to take the top spot between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not ob commit to making a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which it would pay in 10 years and for which it would pay interest for this deferral1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at €1.85; therefore, Nueva Rumas' offer values the company 18% below market value.
According to Nuev Rumas, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the fair value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a deadline of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV said it was not informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateose's company confirmed that it had contacted the regulator.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the sos capitalization is 254.27 million.
Sos, meanwhile, continues to change the structure of its leadership.
The election of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit was announced as an attempt to stay on the fringes of possible bids to buy and settle the legal ups and downs of his former leaders, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar.
This decision makes her the first woman to occupy a high position in a food business.
It is a newly created place that will be subject directly to the president of the group.
And it is not exempt from controversy as the company continues to be brodd in a legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than $230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers' companies.
In fact, the possibility of Sos unveiling new fund transfers in the coming months cannot be shredded
As for the Salazar credit, former council members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified in the National Court yesterday and confirmed that they approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV allows paternity exclusion option in which Inversora Mer participated
Yesterday, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) allowed the expulsion of Inversora Mer against Federico Paternin9. October.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorises this operation as it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and considers that the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the modifications introduced on 2 December is 'sufficient'.
CNMV clarified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, representing 8,95 % of the company's capital, which consists of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He went on to explain that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized and could not be transferred in any way until the offer, which it specified was set by Federico Paterno in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards, had been immobilized.
New tools for car valuation
These days of storms and accidents, not only garages make money.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insured event are towed to a service centre, where the expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No claim is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be long and complex work.
It can take two or three hours to manually calculate repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros, including parts and manpower.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this kind of system.
Suppliers of claims and maintenance estimation services and solutions are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American solera group, is a leading company; 80% evaluation is carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation tools and information development on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, Commercial Director of Audatex, they work with 63 manufacturers and importers in Spain, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been mentioned in the last five years than in the previous 15 years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
This is a very frantly work, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "poke out" individual parts of touring cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about is Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park in circulation, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documenting and developing databases, Audatex has eight centres divided around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million a year in developing these databases.
2.5 million data are collected each month and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense stream of information enables businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common uses focus on repair and maintenance, but there are also tools for managing spare parts or calculating the sales or residual value of a car by country.
The only undertaking with a guide informing about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer them in our country, but in the United States, it does.
With regard to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This business offers ten different tools, with AudaPlus being the star product, a standard claims valuation solution designed for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is paid according to the application for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, no more than ten times a month.
Then each insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to disable vehicles with a total claim.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying tendencies, performing geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a specific brand have undergone service due to an accident or how many have suffered serious claims over a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
Among other things, it sells gt estimate, which is also designed for connoisseurs, as well as providing digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is an Einsa Group company established in 1971 as a supplier of services and solutions for damage assessment, accidents or car maintenance
Gt Guía Valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and in 2008 they charged €10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization began with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of its bratu is produced in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Solera's worldwide invoicing (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will make €19.1 million, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera Group cost $1.000 million on the stock exchange and is now estimated to be worth a total of $2.400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insured event.
The operation envisaged underwing €59.5 million of the company's 85% capital, which could increase by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively guaranteed to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, spare parts sales and professional dealers who must register before operations begin.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The site currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and adds about 100 new ads every day on the Spanish market.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been disabled cannot return to service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Cars of historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been decommissioned, after preliminary driving.
Four-step service budget
With Auda-Taller, Audatex guarantees that the user will only get a budget in four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding a spare part, creating a budget, and generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the belief of older professionals, who tend to be more or less reticent when using new driving techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with an Internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired using the chassis number, a real graphical display of the model appears, and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges, or discounts, and then print and pass to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service oriented and does not include an estimate of the workforce.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is EUR 350 per year, which the customer can finance.
Audatex is currently working to make these views three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome because it allows you, for example, to select a door and rotate it to display the inside.
