Inflation in Europe jumps on food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is due to the predicted constant rise in food prices.
November's price growth in the 13 euro area countries was above expectations, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent registered after 2.6 percent in October, the Union's Luxembourg statistical office announced.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, BRITISH, and Canadian issuant banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the base interest rate, saying that a dream, along with rising raw material prices and falling unemployment, would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation rates below 2%, in their vicinity.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must deter inflation from having to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation of 3.3 percent represents a 15-year record; it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent in Panělsko.
Inflation in the eurozone has skyrocketed due to soaring food and energy prices.
Futures prices of the furnace rose by 88 percent, and the soybean exchange rate also reached its highest since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil on world markets has risen 52 percent this year, costing it nearly $100 a barrel of black gold last month.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump to 2.5 percent in 2008 from 2.1 percent this year, before falling to 1.9 percent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation will remain at 3 percent over the next 3-4 months, with an average annual rate of 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
The circle of Fidesz supporters has grown significantly since the long stagnation of early December, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while for socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured such low 13 percent support.
For certain party voters, the difference, due to the majority of opposition voters' determination, would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) support compared to a fifth of MSZP support.
According to the survey, the MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support across the population is 2%.
Among some party voters, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
Public opinion of the economy has deteriorated, even with the previous low, the ratio of those who view the country's economic situation as very bad has never been so high at 41 percent, while another 46 percent say the situation is rather bad.
Families are now more pesimissically assessing the change in their material situation after spring and summer hopefuls.
As for the next year, a large part of the population is counting on a second deterioration and only a tenth with improvement.
In December, 71 percent of respondents judged, as much of the gallup surveys so far, that the prime minister is doing his job well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is trusted or strongly trusted by 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orbán's share of supporters is 38 percent.
The prime minister is not trusted by 54 percent, the Fidesz leader by 27 percent.
One indicator of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While, after last October's unrest, the government and prime minister were 35 percent, the share is now only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) only in the run-up to new elections.
It is typical of the interest in the referendum that 60 percent of respondents answered a question about their possible participation, that they would definitely join the referendum and another 20 percent said that it would probably come.
By comparison, only 55 percent would certainly participate in this Sunday's parliamentary elections, and another 15 percent think their turnout is likely. The success of the referendum would be undoubted on the basis of their intentions.
74 percent would say no, 79 percent of doctor's fees, and 84 percent of hospital fees.
If we look at equal shares only in the circle of people surely promising to participate, 81, 84 and 89 percent would reject the introduction of stamp duty, doctor's fees, and hospital fees.
Auchan is the most popular, almost a fifth understeering Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs business triangle maintained last year's 16% rise in the price level, with the difference that vat increases did not take place this year.
Napi Gazdaság article
Napi Gazdaság, a regular Christmas consumer co-star in the Budaörs business triangle, has risen by an average of 16 percent this year, with more than 1,000 forints in all hypermarkets.
Prices in grocery supermarkets soared last December, but the percentage did not show up due to the previously high base, and such a drastic thank you.
It is certainly bleak for consumers that they will not buy what they could have bought last year for less than nine thousand forints for ten thousand.
The consumption co-economy in the hypermarkets under study exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest koe price was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, consumer cos cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and its fish remained almost at last year's level, which was greatly undermined by cruel breasts, nuts and also a upspil.
Bread and flour prices corresponded to data from the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also poured a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
Competition did not have a product price below 200 forints.
Similarly, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two-pint Coca Cola in a return bottle was under 200 forints, so even with a deposit the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, this year, according to the consumer koe daily Napi Gazdaság Auchan, the bag appeared to be the most popular, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the consumer koi daily Napi Gazdaság increased by 15, compared with prices last Christmas, while both Tesco and Auchan added 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest and year's highest consumer koe values, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year's highest and this year's highest is 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was an average of 1,480.
The average price increase last year came to 1,206 forints, with prices affected by VAT growth last Christmas.
It was this process that tovert trade, and department stores clearly could not decide how large price ranges to set for individual products, but they could not predict the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of the product in question, he may lose a significant profit due to a price range adjusted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of the consumer koe daily Napi Gazdaság last year proved so extreme that the price of the most expensive koe was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while for the cheapest, the price difference was 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference did not materialize, the most dramatic ko now cost 1,630 forints more than last year, and also the cheapest by 1,284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, catastrophic price increases have emerged, undermining daily consumption in hypermarkets by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, among other things, is not entirely confirmed by the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured price increases of more than 30 percent over 12 months for several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, according to the consumer koe Daily Economy, this seems almost nemoné, or the price level of the product, rather expensive last year, showed price growth of barely above 10 percent, given the basis even in the worst case.
According to him, flour suppliers are in stronger positions than egg suppliers, and they have managed to push through drastic price increases in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the commercial golden triangle do not enjoy each other, they still report on a good year.
According to our experience, a branch of customers in the three stores visited are not interested in prices.
They buy quantity, durable food takes after salaries.
On Wednesday morning, long queues formed at checkouts in all three supermarkets, or the number of visitors soared.
But, as we know, there is a nie turnover in the countryside, with several international chains complaining to research firms that they are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, they are based on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 cases of pre-prescription infections were registered in hospitals due to inappropriate antibiotic use.
Hospital hygiene conditions, overcrowding, overcrowding of staff do not help stop the disease, says the head of the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places, they also teem on disinfectants.
Recently, mrsa infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in mue, which was taken to hospital after a major traffic accident.
The patient has been isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a car accident was sent home, had to return with AN MRSA infection not long after, and due to a bacterium found in his body, one important operation could not yet be performed.
By December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents had been reported to the Nesocomialis Surveillance National System, said Karolina Böröcz, head of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant disease agents have been confidently registered in hospitals, the others are unknown.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacilline resistant to golden staphylocoke.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by a third of people in their noses without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsil inflammation, horse infections, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
If the bag of antibiotics is administered excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria well reacts to antibiotics develops, is very resistant to antibiotics and is rapidly indented hospital conditions.
In case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with weakened organism, low body weight or in patients in years, I can cause severe hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning sepsis.
According to the chief medical officer of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing wrong with MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice in hospitals.
Infection must not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not only there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the disease agent is not being investigated.
Resists antibiotics
We isolate these patients, the staff massages them in rubber gloves and masks, and we need antibiotics to treat them, Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first told if MRSA is present in their body, so the infection bag cannot be avoided.
Sampling is not in vogue
A large number of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not conducive to preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant disease agents, says Karolina Böröcz.
If this infection occurs characteristically in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals should check the patients admitted and the MRSA carriers will be isolated.
Microbiological sampling of sheep in Hungarian hospitals is not in vogue.
This also plays a role in the national health insurance fund's non-funding of these assessments.
Most cases are detected when a patient suffers from an perceptivable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate antibiotic treatment in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological treatments should be carried out, in order to prevent the emergence of resistance to medicines, ova and hospitals do not do so in any case.
Microbiological sampling is rare in primary and outpatient treatment of patients, karolina Böröczová said.
is based on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most commonly used by medical staff among patients.
Therefore, washing hands and wearing gloves and masks plays a very important role, and there are shortcomings in hospitals as well.
MRSA is transferred by droplet infection and touch, and it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in the conditions of home hospitals.
Rooms, on the other hand, are often crowded, the wombs are often very close to each other, for example, from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
As Karolina Böröcz pointed out, we can also see that hospitals that are in an unfavorable material situation are based on disinfectants, there are few and many patients who are still affected by infections.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are ediched, similar infections are demonstrably less or the further spread of the disease agent can be stopped.
Government program against MRSA
Treating MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance, which is why it is being fought.
In England, for example, the government has drawn up a programme to prevent MRSA or reduce its incidence.
The programme appears to have succeeded, with published data showing a downward trend in MRSA infections in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) prioritises the prevention of the development of multiresitive disease agents (including MRSA), or hospital infections caused by these disease agents.
Police captain, just causing a fatal accident, wasn't drunk
The official expert opinion in the case of Police Captain XXII, only to cause a fatal accident, is complete.
It can be ruled out that the XXII police captain who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday, who has since resigned from his post, would be driving under the influence of alcohol or intoxication, attila Morvai, spokesman for the Capital's Attorney General's Office, said on Friday after an expert opinion on the case had been completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial assessment, which stated that the former police captain had not previously, not behind the wheel, had not drunk any alcohol.
On Tuesday, the head of the XXII District Police Directorate hit Lahos Kossuth in XXII with his own passenger car as he turned a 55-year-old mue, who entered in front of him as he was crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The latter fact that the pedestrian was crossing off the zebra is not an extenuating circumstance according to the rules of the road, the turning car must still give priority.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Because of these events, the district police chief resigned and asked for a transfer to the service, according to a statement from the police, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being carried out by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with prosecutors from the beginning.
Another €400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks, worth a total of €400 million to support collage, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy, was signed in Budapeti on Friday by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects implemented with support from the Cohesion Fund, at the same time as the parties had previously concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, the contract now signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
A loan agreement of EUR 150 million is also used to finance collage-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of €300 million for Hungary for this purpose, with the remaining €150 million to be used later, with the loan agreement to be edging.
In the field of innovation, the parties have signed a contract for EUR 50 million, which I will use to implement the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecíne.
The meeting also discussed the 4th metro line.
The parties agreed that, after Hungary had agreed with the EU on the details of metro financing, they would return to whether and how the original treaty needed to be modified.
According to János Veres, this may happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary since 1990 with €8.4 billion.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and no commitment commission shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of bulgaria's real estate market is astounding attention throughout Europe is turning to the previously slightly neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the still cheapest, but rapidly healing EU market?
Analysis of re/max's Bulgarian division.
Bulgaria, with its cheap lyric apartments and seaside houses, is now undoubtedly the most sought-after Eastern European destination for real estate purchases.
Of the mountains, the bansko, borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoa areas are the most popular, while Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Shores, the ancient towns of Sozobol and Nesebar are the most popular, and more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balchiku.
According to analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country will also attract interest from investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, and more and more buyers are also buying around the cheap city of Ruse.
Sofia's capital, too, promises tempting moths, with business and office space promising the highest returns.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, becoming a popular destination in the next two seasons alongside the summer and winter seasons.
Predictive investors buy it in bulk, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lifestyles and lifestyles.
Most of the customers come from England, with buyers from France, Belgium, The Netherlands and, increasingly, Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, while there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and in lyar paradises.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgiy Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settled people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or decimated old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They have good accessibility and the moths of communication, important for them is the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium or long term.
Real estate in the capital is uninternthed, or demand is increasing.
Although real estate prices in the European Union are the most low in Bulgaria, avak has grown by 21 percent annually over the past five years.
The rise in house prices far outweighs the increase in wages.
Fodor and Hungarian est percent
According to information from Minister of Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, the expert meetings will be concluded on Tuesday, and after wednesday's official opening, the international conference on climate reim after 2012 will continue with the ministerial meeting.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Road map, following the emissions-reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At the moment, they are under fierce debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not now wish to discuss exact figures, although it is leaning towards an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020, given the situation in 1990.
The conference's next big question is whether developed countries will accept, in addition to reducing emissions, to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that are reliing on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member Governing Board, the weakest under the UN World Programme for the Protection of the Environment (GEF), we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian est percentage
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water Management, supports the EU's efforts to take a leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the success of the agreement's adoption after 2012, and is ready to commit to a 30 percent dreaming if other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments corresponding to their priorities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set themselves a dreaming target of 5.2 percent, while the 15 EU Member States had committed to 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will meet. is recalled in a press release from the Ministry of The Environment.
There is a lot at issue in Bali, or within two years an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted, otherwise its entry into force would surely be postponed and in 2012. In that case, the dreaming commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new emissions-reduction system, its necessity was highlighted in its latest report by the IPCC, the IPCC's international scientific body on climate change, but a Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
This would lead to a delay in emissions reductions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature on Earth of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say would have extremely severe and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British troops post videos of events in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing site, popularizing themselves.
First, YouTube has become popular with the British Air Force (RAF): the resuit units operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of anti-Taliban operations here since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The footage, taken with a miniature helmet-mounted camera, is checked by the Air Force Command, which is in control of combat operations in the Kandahar area, and then sent further to London, where it is transferred to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable
In this form, 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers have been uploaded to the Internet, and more than 75,000 people have watched it on their channel.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as a defenceheadquarters in the spring of 2007 and publishes recordings of events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Foreign Office (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Force in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The air force has released videos according to its original intention for recruitment, and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good for getting to know the iro-like public about the real goal of the military's presence abroad.
The promotion, published in this form, costs almost nothing compared to traditional TV recruitment ads, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, and the avak necessarily also carries a political message, or in a vexing way confirms the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a play
The army is concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos, including the deaths of soldiers, are also being released on the server: in the slightly hypocritical, official promotional films, toti officers speak at best of losses, but the bloody form of combat is not presented.
After all, many videos of the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during a live deployment, were posted online by the British army and now.
The Americans recruit a little differently with a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to play, in which the player can get directly into the soldiers' will through a more or less faithful simulation.
There's going to be a Raffle christmas in the ministries.
Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, where she will say good-bye to 2007 with pogos and coffee.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with music, elsewhere it will create a Christmas atmosphere for officials with a raffle and a toast.
The party, the Christmas atmosphere, the concerts and the Veda table are so much fun for the powerful.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The Ministry of Defence will hold the most urgent ministerial Christmas party this year, but it does not expect its staff to do so.
At Christmas, orphans will receive gifts for the children of fallen soldiers, during Mission Christmas they will receive family guests of soldiers currently on foreign missions, but they will also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort will donate 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
Unlike other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are out of their hooves.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forints and 350,000 guests are expected from the ministry's 1000 employees.
The resort will be crushing Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and a raffle will also be drawn.
NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building with concerts and dinners on the agenda.
The lease of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invitees.
One NFÜ department seems to be invited to another Christmas party: it will be organized by a tender company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) with EU money.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the Vígszínház Theatre.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information, because we were unable to reach the person in question.
No need for a suit
The OIT building was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the St. Lucia Ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
She didn't want money from him to use the OIT bag to use her halls.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party began with a greeting from the Minister, after dinner it was time to dance with the accompaniment of edible music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball, evening ats or suit were not mandatory at all.
The Puritan party is being prepared by health, labour and local government departments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperth does not even officially invite her co-workers to the Christmas party, which is the first time she has been at the final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected to receive only coffee and pagáčka, according to the press department, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Local Government Minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will have a drink in the vule of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, where it expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
For the Christmas party, 2,500 forints per guest are donated, totaling the reception with Veda tables and a toast.
Since János Veres is minister, PM workers have been celebrating Christmas in a similar way every year.
The atmosphere of the party bag will be missing, officiality intensifies not only the ministerial speech, but also the afternoon time of the event.
The Agriculture Department holds a New Year's reception on January 20, with no ministerial Christmas.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyadvár Castle in The Municipal Orchards and according to the ministry's announcement, 1,000 forints per person are intended for 100 guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the most senior foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These cador receptions begin with a brief greeting from the Minister and end with a little post-business.
The State Department and the Ministry of Coke and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the associated press department told the [origo] portal.
They could not disclose the price of christmas celebrations to the resort of the environment in the press department.
In any case, 400 people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
A massive strike is about to take place
The Union of Trade Unions The Liga and the National Workers' Councils Union (MOSZ) will form their strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike.
A public protest is held on Saturday, and work will be stopped on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The action will certainly cause a major disruption, as the equestian traffic will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League will brief the National Union of Workers' Councils on the details of Monday's strike.
There will also be a strike committee LIGA MOSZ, which will coordinate monday's action.
There will be a public protest on Saturday, and from Monday the unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely unless there is an agreement with the government.
This means that no date has been set for the end of the strike, which will start on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not eventually adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will withdraw the call for strike action.
If the legislation is voted on, the strike committees will meet to decide on the next course of action.
According to the agenda of parliament's meeting on Monday, it is also possible that the health insurance bill will be voted on and in the late evening or at night.
Due to the strike starting on Monday, it is possible to count on the traffic disruptions: the work on the eleznice will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning part of Budapest's public transport can be stopped, and more than half of the companies called.
At the same time, half of the runway will also be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous trade unions and civic organisations have joined the call for strike action, and their list is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations announced an indefinite strike, others announced temporary work stoppages.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Workers' Union of Eleznice (VDSZSZ) had not been able to agree on sufficient service, with more and more people traveling on the climber at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the current announcements, from the beginning of operations until 1 p.m. to 1 p.m., from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the LIGA Energy Workers' Union, and the 2-and-8-hour work stoppage called for by the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers.
The Union of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately across the country, and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), part of the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is holding a two-hour strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is for the government to withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and put forward a new concept for public discussion.
The second step is that the new method of counting pensioners, in force from next year, should be introduced gradually.
The third is to ensure that early retirement for the relevant fields of work is provided for the possibility of inclusion in the scheme before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Union of Employees of the Eleznice (VDSZSZ), which is part of the Liga trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding the e-rail branches and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country Risk
The work of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August of this year, increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute.
In the company's risk warning, pie: in the context of the Hungarian Guard's activities, the greatest political risk is that, by sharpening the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma populations of Hungary, violent ethnic clashes may occur in the short term.
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to be aimed at provoking such an action, the research institute adds.
As Pie put it, this can be explained by one of the most serious negligences of Hungarian political leaders: the public debate on the Roma issue was left to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian conflict.
This deepens the problem, deceachs normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts occurring, the Institute says.
Moreover, according to the Research Institute, the work of the Hungarian Guard has largely damaged Hungary's image abroad, I predict, in terms of faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturity, due to the great attention of both domestic and foreign media.
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of Hungary's radical and ultra-right groups, which has been receiving increasing publicity and vehemence since autumn 2006, is that several organisations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which are themselves called national militia associations.
A common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civic associations, while openly proclaiming the armed readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the event of major disasters, infestations of the homeland, disrupting order), in addition to the incompetence of the police, army, or state, he adds.
He goes on to note: this is done in a way that is trying to wrap the most different political efforts built on society's opposition to politics and parties in civilian robes.
Thus, the stress of civility and the form of the association in the case of these groups do not only serve to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increase factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger, while ultra-nationalist political leaders in some neighboring countries want to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policies, citing the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
This may affect the political stability of the region, he adds.
According to the Research Institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
As pie, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, its creation announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the backdrop of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard stands the mass Roma riots that broke out in one of Sofia's districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used it to start a guard, saying the organization's goal was a national militia.
For the past 17 years, she says, there has been gypsy terror in Bulgaria, and the state has remained idle and indifferent, political capital points out.
He adds that the initiative has provoked a heated debate among the Bulgarian public.
As he continues to say, the increased risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own guard as a sign of resistance.
Although the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is possible that hungarian Roma will respond to the threat in a similar way, by setting up their own militia, we can read in the risk warning prepared by Political Capital.
When asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year and if they find anything that could affect the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not vude free
In Hungary, days off are precisely stipulated by law and it has become a common practice that working days are moved around the holidays, which we will have fewer times next year.
In the European Union and America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and public holidays and days of rest.
Days of rest are much more important for ecclesiastical holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a day off on New Year's Day so that people can relax after New Year's Eve.
During the year we have a total of eleven holidays.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the 1848 revolution, and October 23, a commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the beginning of the state, on May 1 we celebrate the work, on November 1st and 2nd we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, easter, Letnice and Christmas are two-day holidays.
According to the calendar, public, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price for the long weekends is that we stay on the work and bike the preceding Saturdays.
The day immediately preceding or following the holiday is adjusted for many years by the Minister of Labour.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employed workers, to public employees and to persons in public service.
It does not apply to companies and institutions that operate without disruption or, with regard to their destination, also operate on rest days.
This year, the working rules will be changed only around the end-of-year holidays: from 24 December, life in the country will almost stop, or according to the experience so far, most people will work the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve in advance or take a washed-up holiday in this way.
In the next year, several holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer shifts of the working day than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is transformed around Labor Day so that workers can stay home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, can be a day of rest.
Dalí's move is related to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, work will be made instead of Friday, October 24.
The end of the year will be able to take place entirely in the sign of holidays, because from 24 December they will have almost a 24/7 holiday, even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
est removing little things you can use to make your colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voicemails that we never receive, innocent people that we almost don't even notice: this in the days of work.
The question is whether you will get used to these minor inconveniences, or put on gloves and deliberately avoid unclear situations that can make others angry.
tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you you were wanted by the marketing department, a colleague will tell you.
That's why you closed the meeting?
In the best case, he regrets it and tries to fix it, or he calls the marketing department and says that he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common saying).
Most often, the matter is shaken by one apology.
Before, not an embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you could do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments and consciously try to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant, not when you reach for a document, office supplies or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember embeding a suave on your desk last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover your pen on the desk of one of your colleagues, which you thought was lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they'll rightly be mad at you for going through their stuff.
Don't take envelopes or sticky paper out of your office, because it can be annoying when you run out prematurely, and you'll need them.
Rumors of colleagues' private lives?
There's no good way to stop the rumors.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don't tell everyone your report (conjecture) about the private life of your colleagues!
When one of them shares their innermost secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
Lock in what you've heard, and in his absence, don't talk to your colleagues, even when others know about his stuff.
You're reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence, citing a severe headache, because you are not well, or you think that you would rather rest today, think about your work, urgent tasks and work that have a certain deadline, someone else will have to do for you.
Consider your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something may happen that will make you have to stay at home, report it so that your colleagues and managers are not confronted with your absence and the next day.
Hinging, giggling, making phone calls
Have you immersed yourself in work, and you're roughly pulled out of it by the giggles of your colleagues?
You inadvertently witnessed a phone conversation that would be sticky not to be heard at all?
Do not disturb your coworkers by hinging, chanting, loudly talking (above their heads), or stomping, constantly swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
This can be disruptive even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for mistakes?
If something is not in time or you forgot to send an important letter or message, do not blame others for your forgetfulness!
Don't recuse yourself from the chaos in the office and the roaring colleagues!
Admit if you made a mistake and someone paid the price and repair the damage!
Ask how you can fix things, fix negligence!
Do you feel too at home in the office?
Sweatpants and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, sheep do not fit the office!
Don't wear leisure clothes, even if your profession allows it!
Don't be sloppy, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in white ats and, if your profession does, nice and elegant!
When a person wants to suit, it ceases to be interesting
Driving in the usual morning traffic jam.
From the radio you will hear a resoverning melody: the sound of violins, electronic effects are attached to it.
I'm adding volume.
The music changes pace and bass is added to the previous tonal colours, then the En choir joins as a real gem.
On the MR2 station is a song by Zagar called Wings of Love.
For a long time, the domestic music life did not just smear us with quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the traffic looks quite different, because he's listening to zagar's new album right now.
The revelation of Yonderboi, a few new and interesting productions coming from the home digital underground, is slowly changing the picture, and although gará rock is back in vogue with its guitar beats, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started out in The Five-Way, and he also played in Yonderboi's band, and in the end, perhaps because two woodpeckers can't fit in one line, he went his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, the bag began to break through, and when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film by Ferenc Török Szezon).
His formation, playing in the early days of the change clubs, was recognized by irish audiences after wan2 magazine ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 domestic records and declared Zagar at Yonderboie to be almost the only domestic development-determining entity that could be marketed in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly on course, although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as they should: they made a new, sticky album.
The now-released album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, may open up new paths for them, although the title itself is trying to establish a connection with the initial flights in The Five-Way.
It is one of the ver songs of balázs Zságer's old band there.
A reference to ethereal, flying would be in place, avak next to the ethereal touch of this music has now appeared in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the times louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
These songs featured singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, at the premiere of the album at Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to mr2 station Petőfi, which has been playing popular music from morning to evening lately, the smoustering melodies of Wings of Love, recorded with esti domestic singers (Underground Divas), began to hang out.
Take everything ok (?).
The portal hvg.hu interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question arises, how much does what you play remain fringe music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of fringe music doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and they can only be created for the sake of selling what makes it commercial.
Even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the position as it is adopted also works, regardless of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Does he see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, I will predict from us to the west, my light music has a branch of tradition.
It's not just teenagers and people in their 20s who go to concerts there, but also the old.
They are much more closely watching the transformations of light music going on around them, because they also see it as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where and in how many ways listens to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it feels good that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived sleeping at concerts where mutual influence works, but it hides only in the indistainable changes of the eye.
Nevertheless, I knew that when one wanted to suit an audience, from that moment on it ceased to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How much is yonderboi's example coming to follow?
He works solo and has built his career from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, no matter how much they try to explain the music.
We sleep team players who rely on each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, of course, it was not to avoid comparing our work to Yonderboi's songs, but a few of us separated from his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love came first on mr2's top list.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In popular style, did you consciously open up to the Irish classes?
B.Zs.: We didn't plan on writing a hit song to sell a record.
There's more to this song.
We made it a mistake as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous audio with and the themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the est singers?
Why is the guiding principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea of assembling this chorus of soloists from the domestic music scene with a good voice.
So this esti-member choir got together, so Sena, Edin Kutzor, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then renamed underground divas.
hvg.hu: Is this exactly how you got the song wrong, or did the girls reshap it?
B.Zs.: The song existed for a long time in the instrumental version, when the material was then put on the record, we thought that something else would be needed for this song.
A sequence of chords led him to join him in the singing part.
That night I sang a melody on it that the girls later learned.
The whole thing howl almost the first time and so spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but of course it took wonders.
It wouldn't work that vigorously with my voice.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, the girls seemed to be in the background.
They don't have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing completely together and they're not louder than music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were also standing in the back.
Is that on purpose?
B.Zs.: The way they were standing in the back was only because of technical problems.
On the contrary, the not wanting to divide solo roles is intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting our egos, where they're from, where they belong, and just letting those wings, the wings of love, rise up.
I wished that the euphoric state we felt when the song was born was felt by others.
hvg.hu: Which one was the most work with?
B.Zs.: During the composing of music, in fact, not one of the pieces occurred sleeping while mixing.
For example, Dorian Grays Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or RocknRoll Goes To The Girls, where groove didn't work for a long time, then slowly took its place in a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That's always changing with the concerts and the fact that I released the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Treacherous broker risked billions from inferiority
Treacheious embezzer.
This is what the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the domestic Komerční banka, refers to its former employee, Jerome Kervial.
It has cost it almost €5 billion.
Rather, kerviel seems to be just a big player who wanted to match his teammates and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all the big banks, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He's mentally weaker," said his superiors, who sent the police after him.
But, as Kervier's testimony to the French media, such as Le Monde, shows, he was a man who made €1.6 billion in profits from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros from the US crisis.
He sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those with a history of repayment problems, would have problems.
But this crisis should not have had an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet right.
At the end of the year, its profit climbed to €1.6 billion.
"Even when I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to falsifying records so that they wouldn't be found.
He even managed to trick his bosses, even though the Eurex exchange became interested in his trades.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd find out?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to take that kind of risk?
He had to work his way up to his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never earn as much as anyone else.
"Even in my first interview in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after boarding came the first great success.
Thanks to alllianz's shares, he made a fortune, betting on the fall of this title in the london bombings.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you're making money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the officers.
But the bosses knew about everything, or rather suspected it.
"As long as I was making money, they were closing their eyes."
But then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank reported that it had lost €5 billion because of it.
And how did they find out about him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who is not on vacation is a broker who does not want to be looked at in his records," Kerviel concluded.
The Czech Republic has a chance to raise 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can receive €14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is roughly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around CZK 100 billion from the Business and Innovation programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Business and Innovation programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organizational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful in drawing money from EU funds within newly adopted countries.
20-year sentence for ex-Nicaragua president upheld by court
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for the country's former president, Arnold Aleman, to whom he was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud amounting to $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
However, he was later released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan capital.
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at this time, according to ap.
According to Ileana Pérez, president of the court of appeal, it will now be up to prison officials whether they let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to offshore accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious, and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of that money then ended up in a fund that Aleman set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without opposition support.
This year it passed with the support of the ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies calmly passed this traditionally overlooked, albeit most influential, law.
It's a paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government's power struggle with the opposition.
This is more grateful to the media and therefore pays much more attention to it in the media.
Arguing politicians is much more interesting to the public than austere numbers.
State budgets in past Social Democratic governments have suffered from three ailments that the 2008 budget is unable to solve at once:
The first is a high proportion of statutory so-called mandatory expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year before the elections by a quiet "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is deficit management as a result of the ailment of the first.
The third limit is public deficits, i.e. the deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
But the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
But the time bomb is the deficit in the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to money from taxes, fees, and loans from banks, often recklessly issue bonds that disproportionately indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have succeeded in repaying these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other grids that they received from the state in privatizations.
They no longer have this resource.
If we stick only to official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as has the rest of the world, which is constantly boasting about ČSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, they increasingly indebted the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more sensibly than our republic.
It is a huge embarrassment, especially for past governments.
We are among the countries least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have scalded to gigantic proportions in recent years.
Even if some of the nonsensical populist spending approved before the elections this year has been abolished, unless the retirement threshold and pension reform are pushed back in the near future, then any policy in this country will effectively end, and whoever rules will be merely in office.
With little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically distributing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the extrusion of normal spending by mandatory spending.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if previous governments had not managed what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not really want the ruling politicians to become just civil servants, then we must be patient and give this not-so-strong coalition government, which realises that the state can only spend as much as it can in taxes and fees, peace of mind to prepare further reform laws.
Only these will allow a balanced state budget to be gradually achieved.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in financial markets.
More than $100 billion will reach currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks auction the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will send $40 billion to auction, and another 24 will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that national central banks have agreed on such coordinated action to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move is intended to address the economy's biggest problems, the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the economic outlook group, a consultancy, wrote in a note to clients.
"Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in non-performing loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect billions more losses.
"Central banks must be really worried about what else can happen when they decide to do this," said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
"The situation seems to be really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also be able to lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy into recession with possible effects on the economic growth of the entire world.
Central banks made this decision after failing to reduce the LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about lending money to each other, even though the US, Canadian and BRITISH central banks cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as another interest rate cut," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that central banks' move will help avert a crisis because it does not address a fundamental problem, and that is the collapse of the US housing market.
Klaus: Environmental debates are incredible
Global climate change is supposed to do the most damage to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus has once again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been leveled at the outgoing UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he said the environmental debates were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality, is unacceptable.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that her topic is very important to him and therefore he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book also appears in a German translation because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my opinions."
So now those interested can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he believes he has enough qualifications to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge professional treatises, has experience in statistics and is also a national economy.
He cited as the main conclusions of the book the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are normal, that there is no consistent view of the warming of the planet by all scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not very large and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a person with experience of totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to induce unproteted opinions to others, which he sees as a dangerous restriction on freedom.
When asked by those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between costs and their use."
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people didn't have time to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and did not have time to exchange their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue them a new ID card by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid permit will take to the road after the New Year.
According to the authorities, the card was not changed mainly by those who no longer want to drive.
While municipalities report a bronchi drop in interest in changing their driver's licenses, authorities in the metropolis are in a state of disassade, and interest in changing licenses has increased this week.
The municipality is off-hours with around 2,000 clients a day.
Queues wait about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not changed their driving licences.
It takes 20 days to issue a new card.
However, extradition may be requested within a reduced period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will pay five hundred crowns more.
Motorists who miss the mandatory exchange of their licence by the end of the year and go on the road without a valid licence will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, a police officer can also solve the offence by agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will be 2500 CZK.
According to earlier information, even a person who wasn't going anywhere could have been fined by city hall.
He could have paid 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had previously called on the authorities to be lenient and impose a fine of no more than 1,000 crowns.
However, according to Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, there are no tens of thousands of fines.
According to him, a driving licence is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not an ID card that every person has to have valid.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving licence.
Just take it away or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal authority.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to apply.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court reduced sentences for detectives conspiring with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal association with David Berdych's gang, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
The Prague High Court decided with definitive effect, reducing their sentences by one by a year and the other by two years.
Originally, detectives from the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime were threatened with 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also indicted in the case, but he is awaiting a first-instance verdict.
In other cases, however, he has already received sentences totaling more than 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the regional court found 19 people guilty of involvement in robberies, and the high court today heard appeals by 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have denied the charges since the investigation began, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, among others, passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent of the loo from the magnifying glass to Opava and Cognac.
The indictment alleges gang crime from 1999 to 2001.
Especially robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious bodily harm, but also the abuse of authority of a public official and illegal armaments.
During house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core bullets, a laser sight or a submachine gun.
According to the indictment, the gang came to tens of millions of crowns in robberies.
In addition to the nearly 20 men in the trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of other people guilty of other robberies.
Other men around Berdych are still testifying in another trial before the trial, some of which have not yet been taken to court.
The trial has so far avoided Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic for prosecution.
Child rescheduy bill: 12 million
Igor Veleba, a lawyer for the injured families, wants 12 million crowns in damages from the Třebíč hospital for the submersible children in the maternity hospital, plus court costs.
For each mother of three million, for fathers of two million and for children by the million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Ondřej Dostál, the hospital's legal representative, strongly disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"However, in order to get an opinion on the counter-propose, we need an expert opinion that the opposing party has commissioned.
Let's see if it's worth anything at all.
But we remain of the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between CZK 100,000 and CZK 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for every month when they did not raised their biological daughter.
Veleb was served as a basis for negotiating compensation by an expert opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol.
According to psychology experts and psychiatrists, the children's parents suffered psychological harm and stress at various levels and depths.
Men were better able to endure the stressful situation, although they faced remorse for not being able to prevent the newborns from being in the way.
Women, in turn, are having a harder time dealing with the news of the trauma experienced, and with what is happening right now, he summarized the content of Veleba.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč maternity hospital on 9 December last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermákov in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the Governor of vysočina Miloš Vystrčil handed over CZK 100,000 to each of the families to cover expenses incurred by the fault of the Třebíč hospital, which the region is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for damage.
In the event of misconduct, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they may ask the founder for help.
So far, the courts have awarded relatively low compensation to people, the sums were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup has lost the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the Brand of the Wallachian Kingdom.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he first used the name Wallachian King, but the project built a long-term work around Tomáš Harabiš, who cooperated with the actor.
Soup did not attend the hearing today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone remembers the actor and comedian at the words of the Wallachian Kingdom.
Harabiš has the same opinion.
"Almost ten years of work are behind us.
Raise money and invent events," he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"Years later, they realized that the project was a success and could make a big impact.
They want to parasitize on our work," he added.
Lucrative business
According to the court, the wallachian king first used Polívka in his TELEVISION show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
At the time, however, it had nothing to do with the intention to build a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionary event turned out to be a business and lucrative business activity, which was then followed by harabiš's founding of the Wallachian Kingdom company.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to put his name and signature on his passports and even offered discounts to their holders when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš merely used the bare idea that Polívka had published in the mane for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who devoted himself intensively to it.
Cooperation between the parties now at war continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have begun to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the dething of "King Boleslav I, elected all the time".
Singer Jarmila Šuláková took the leading role in the kingdom at the insugged harabiš as queen mother.
In 2002 Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court dismissed today.
Harabiš's upcoming battle for the throne and half the princess could bring clarity to the dispute.
A new king should come out of it.
He wouldn't divulge the details and deadline yet.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be like riding kings in The Slovak Republic.
A king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr Polívka can apply," added Harabiš.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearing prejudices
To tell you the truth, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not very good, the quality of shifting, steering and also production could sometimes be described as below average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And a station wagon called SW goes a little further, and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the head space in the backseat.
This is the end of the complaints here, because the bodywork of the station wagon means that even two-meter tall people will not suffer in this direction.
Flying around the world
I'm going to go through the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty good design, where my only resentful is for the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer invention when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The side guidance has also improved significantly against the 206.
In space, there is also an increase in body dimensions.
In the station wagon, the aforementioned lack of space overhead disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
So the main thing about this car is its luggage rack.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (also thanks to the tilting rear window) and as decently storable.
The deaf spots are equipped with retaining rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not get in the way, it can be stretched while retaining heavier objects.
But let's pause together over volume.
According to the tables, the basic layout is 428 l, which is more of an average value compared to the competition.
But not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladoboleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging behind by a very noticeable 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I still have to mention a completely flat floor after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 hp in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what the 16-inch that drives the family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, pulls.
If I compare it to the Skoda equivalent, which sometimes feels like it has a rag stuffed into the exhaust, I can only be thrilled with it.
The price list will tell you
The price of the car is not folk.
However, we must bear in mind that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a spark ignition 1400 for CZK 329,900 is still good.
Our aggregate costs from 410,900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then add an additional CZK 80,000 to the top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper triggering, electric rear window controls...
Simply, the car costs 531,900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the extras at Fabio's and you'll come up with a very similar number.
So all we have to do is decide on the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
There is a growing number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools, raising concerns among local residents about the further development of local education.
So far, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and indigenous children are growing violent.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe in British schools illustrates well the case in north Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Fights, bullying and fights between pupils have also translated into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far as to arrest a Slovak woman in Chatham who beat a 10-year-old pupil with an iron rod.
The guilty defend themselves that the boy insulted her with racist slurs.
Police had to intervene after two teenage girls attacked a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly made racist comments and threw rocks at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he smothered us with apples and pears, and then he exposed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils told The Times.
Complaints are from both sides.
One local resident even described disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who have come here for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba's prettiest island in the Caribbean
It really is an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can come true if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a pond.
Palm trees and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and heady cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea, you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
But there is much more to be found on just one island, and the island is Cuba, the largest and prettiest of the Great Antille.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba used to be a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a treasure trove of treasures that the Spaniards in America robbed and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the very late 1920s.
It was built by one of the american mafia bosses, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially during Prohibition) was welcomed and encouraged in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others, The New Year's Day.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses were built in Havana, and cars that belonged to the iconic symbols of the 1950s drove along wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farmhouse in San Francisco de Paula, just outside Havana, and had his yacht in Cojímar.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls in Bodeguit, Havana.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional they will mix you a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s still drive around Havana, because once-imported giraffes and fiats have long since rot in that salty and humid air.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is considerably dilapidated, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments around as there are.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, like Trinidad.
Since tourism brings in much-needed money, its development has the green light.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadera, on the coast of Holguín province, as well as on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more pleasure, which is unique in the world and will be especially appreciated by the viters.
Cane from large plantations was tied into sugar canes by steam and motor trains along narrow tracks.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so there are working machines whose contours are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not miss.
And so there's no need to break down much about Varadera or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in the aforementioned Hemingway estate, and those who like this writer should not miss the visit.
Viňales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viňales Valley in the west of the island.
Lush vegetation grows from limestone bedrock.
Mogots, limestone homoles and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil has taken hold in their hollows, making even the windy rocks covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is where perhaps the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see its final form if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Maybe some people find it interesting that a Chilean major zeman's work was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Fame and fortune were brought to him by the slave and sugar trade.
Wealth has been reincarnated into the beauty and exumity of a small town.
Colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that as late as the 1950s there was no road connecting the region with the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and therefore nothing was wrong, everyone was glad to have a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon on Trinidad, it's worth a look at nearby attractions such as Playa Ancón Beach and the Sugar Valley.
In the evening, you can go to Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music in it dies down in the morning.
Baracoa
A small town in the very east of Cuba is described by some as the prettiest on the island.
Surely this view is influenced by the journey itself.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo have to cross the high and rugged mountains and pass through nature that has been almost unmarked by human activity.
The eastern outing of Cuba has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO due to its intact nature.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (in fact, it was created about a century after Columbus' voyage), and down the hill, where the former castle and today's El Castillo Hotel stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
There are many pages to be described about coffee, rum, cigarillos, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Swimen and isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the santeria, the African religions professed by the descendants of former slaves.
But, as they rightly say, better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
According to the United States, few troops and lack of necessary equipment are affecting the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years, according to Defense Secretary Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the leaders of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are now discussing other plans and allied coordination.
While the United States, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, this week called on NATO forces to do more, the United Kingdom sees priority in strengthening the Authority of the Afghan Government and strengthening development aid.
"Developments in Afghanistan are tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow the population to start further economic and security development on their own," British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is at its highest level in five years, according to U.S. military figures.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent from last year, and by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the Southern Territory.
According to the United States, however, the Allies have reached the limit in both organization and equipment of troops.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We're going to have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and how to achieve them," Gates said.
Nato Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke in a similar venom today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90% of the troops and equipment we would need, and that is not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been controversy among the countries involved in recent months over whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticised for passivity.
"The Germans have quite a large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and combat demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan deadmen revealed: Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in the material, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's Bild went on the counterattack and posted a picture of a British unit at a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debt will be shou tinged to a trillion in 2009
For each Czech, the national debt is over CZK 84,000.
Total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget.
The national debt of the Czech Republic increased to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has decreased by CZK 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its national debt figures from early October today.
For each Czech, the debt is over CZK 84,000.
In the whole of last year, the state became indebted by more than CZK 111 billion.
"For the time being, it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could only surpass the trillion-crown mark in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between CZK 900 billion and CZK 1 trillion," David Marek, a senior iHNed.cz Patria Finance, told the iHNed.cz.
This is similarly seen by Next Finance analyst Vladimir Pikora: "We could get to exceed one trillion in 2009.
Exactly when it will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If the political situation turns out to change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don't foresee that change," he said.
Debts are rising
The national debt consists of central government debts and is mainly due to the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The national debt is financed by treasury vouchers, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has risen by CZK 38.5 billion so far this year to CZK 719.4 billion.
So far this year, the state's foreign debt has increased by CZK 1.7 billion to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
"Total debt grew by 13 percent year-on-year in the first to third quarter, which is a lot for the economy to do.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that there will be something to trade with when there is pension reform," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The strategy for financing and managing the national debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better development of the state budget.
The amount consists mainly of a deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated CZK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency are CZK 13.3 billion, a ten billion czk reserve for the payment of pensions, financing of government bonds for CZK 43 billion and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in Khartoum Magistrates' Court today for giving her name to a teddy bear
A British teacher on trial in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison and expelled by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday night, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of letting a six-year-old pupil give a teddy bear the name Muhammad, despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was subjected to a whiplash penalty.
The British teacher, 54, who is based at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of sudan's penal code, after the parents of several pupils lodged a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, our story begins as early as September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
"There are eight names from the mouths of the children, among them Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," says the school's headmaster, Robert Boulos.
After the class votes, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Of course Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all it is a very widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of the teddy bear accompanied by the caption: 'My name is Muhammad'.
The teddy bear itself did not have a label with that name on it, but the problem is in the depiction of the prophet himself, considered an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a fellow Muslim who teaches at the same school in Sudan, clarified that he knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith:"I only regret that she asked children to vote for a name," which he said was merely "innocent misconduct."
This view is shared by many of the teacher's pupils, who describe her as "very attentive to her pupils", adding that she "never talks about religion in the classroom".
Recall that the first name Muhammad is also the second most commonly awarded first name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
However, what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Ultimately, failure.
Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without overcoming differences in the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides have not been able to reach an agreement on status," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His AMERICAN counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Prsichna to heed their commitments to peace and to be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations are over.
"We do not expect violence anytime soon, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, adding that "it is evident that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on 10 December
The Troika negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their final trip to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of albanian-speaking populations are made up, could be in a brighter light as of December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are due to report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN commissioned the Troika to renegotiate in August this year.
The Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had previously blocked Kosovo's granting of independence in the UN Security Council, insist that negotiations continue after this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Kharchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance of the international community, the West regards Kosovo's independence under EU supervision as a workable solution.
Pristina declares that it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally if the Security Council does not vote in its favour.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached an agreement," said Fatmir Sejdiu, president of the Kosovo government, at the Baden hotel where the "last chance negotiations" had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, a former rebel commander of Kosovo's Albanians and a future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations."
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, believes that a compromise is still an option and has warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of a possible unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "domino effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the independence wars of the 1990's.
"But it does not mean for Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only the solution coming from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the floor of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on status" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by albanian-speaking people, it would take place "in agreement" with the West.
Bush reaches agreement on Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened at his insucement, US President George Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He clarified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately with the intention of resoaring the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures," and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides from the "road map" to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the Negotiations between Israel and the Abbas-led Palestinian Authority are aimed at "concluding a peace treaty that would resolve all issues that have not yet been decided, including central issues."
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the state of Israel in the 1948 conflict.
Abbas took the word out of the US President, emphasizing that the follow-up negotiations should be "comprehensive and thorough" and that it would touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others."
Then Olmert stepped into the stands, expressing the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "we must work to ensure that it is concluded during 2008."
Bush designated the end of 2008 as the date for realizing his "vision of two states," Palestinian and Israeli, that existed side by side.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment from Bush to this effect before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories seizeed during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in The History of the Middle East, especially as it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud says in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking newspaper backing Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the Black Chronicle, the official versions do not match what is said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (IGPN), a police car was passing through Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5pm on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in hit mode, but was on patrol and traveling at 40 to 50 km/h without the side lights on," the police source explains.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore without permission to ride on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, was passing at a "very high speed".
"The motorcycle crashed into a police car from the left side after not preferring from the right," said one officer.
A blood alcohol test performed on the vehicle's vehicle's vehicle's trailer showed negative.
The condition of the car (broken front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the sharpness of the impact.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontois (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into 'acts of involuntary manslaughter and failure to assist persons in danger', which is also being taken up by the direction départementale de la sûreté publique du Val-d'Oise (Directorate of the Regional Police department of the Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN-led investigation excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police for the accident.
According to the official, three witnesses to the accident, who were questioned on Sunday evening, confirmed "the police version, namely that the mini-engine approached them relatively quickly from the left."
A striation, no doubt caused by the rubbing of clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedged until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will pass technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a lot of talk that officers should have left the scene quickly without first aiding and assisting two young men.
The IGPN should have, with all caution, also ruled out "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
"It's a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and needs to be very careful," a police source said.
The daily "Libération" met an eyewitness to the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
"Immediately, my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, ran downstairs to try and resurrect them," says this witness.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw "a limping, completely terrified policeman.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the youths, and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with rapidly increasing tensions and the certainty of those present that the situation of the youths was hopeless, the policemen were taken away by the car of colleagues, who had since arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the officers left."
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one say that the police authorities did not rush to the young men's aid.
These young men were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency, two days earlier.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken as part of an emergency were wounded by tear gas grenades, which witnesses said were used by riot police.
The latter responded with rocks, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been subpoenaed.
Similar scenarios to karachi and rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be subpoenaed.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were oversteed monday morning to prevent rallies.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement gained the support of religious parties grouped in the politically powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "urged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the exceptional state and garbage to those who took the oath before Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise does not apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was due to speak about the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election on October 6.
The president of the court, Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
"Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against Supreme Court rulings," the official told The News.
Parvez Musharraf's promise to relinquish the leadership of the army and become a civilian president "does not apply" after the introduction of the extraordinary state, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to relinquish his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation in the country that the deputy head of the military should have ordered President Musharraf to be grounded.
More than a third of pregnancies are still unexpected pregnancies
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly planned or occurprise.
More than one pregnancy in three (36%), is still unexpected today, says a study led by france's Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined),- The State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called "national d'atudes démographiques". The Neuwirth Act, which enammed contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly planned or occurprise.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
After all, the enacing of contraception has enabled better "fertility control," the institute argues, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptives in women between the age of 20 and 44 has now reached 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight out of ten births are well planned today.
One in five couples even have a birth calculated per month accurately and preferably in spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of year for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
More than seven hours of space work was needed by astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) to remarkably repair the torn solar panel necessary for the station's further scientific activities.
It was a risky ascent into space, which set records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed with which it was planned, and the degree of "DIY" astronauts had spent on repair.
The troubles arose on Tuesday, while astronauts from discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical formation designed to install a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pier for modules-laboratories.
However, they must be able to supply electricity.
The crew's second task was therefore to move the 17-and-a-half-ton module generating electricity using solar panels already on the ISS to anchor at its final habitat.
After moving it, the crew began to decompose the module's 67-meter solar panels.
And in this, one of the panels, decomposing like a tractor harmonica, as a result of pinching the cable, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Decomposite has been paused to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a control ascent to the Discovery ship and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system malfunctioned, were forced to attend to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the ship's robotic arm, added to the station arm, and make a repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers of the U.S. Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very skilful, he has a very well-worked chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was entrusted by a doctor to "operate" on an "injured" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fastened some "splints" to the damaged areas.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the leveling chamber, as well as from the inside, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, a mini-kit bandaged with insulating agent to prevent electroshok on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "DIY" made by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely decomposed and then inventoryed his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were enjoying a half-day's rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery spacecraft to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are noticeably losing ground on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defence company announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to face delays to the A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at €21.96.
The financial group was forced to reassess its projected production results for 2007 as a result of delays resulting from the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the inaugural flight.
The cost of alleviating delays in the delivery of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was put at "between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus," announced the european designer's parent company EADS.
Because of these costs, EADS will be forced to report a new earnings outlook before interest and tax (EBIT) when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that EADS production results fell by 86% in 2006 mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the giant A380.
Originally, the group expected to deliver the first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Decision for the status quo
Sunday's election will take place without tense anticipation: Russians will majority President Putin's party, United Russia.
Thus, after the end of very little free election campaign, they confirm their gravitational over stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will convey a pre-filmed television message to voters on public broadcasters, the content of which is kept secret.
He is doing so as leader of United Russia, a pro-Swiss party that is expected to celebrate a landslide victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president left nothing out of him and settled for another attack on the West accused of interference - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the value of true democracy and we want honest, transparent and open elections, elections without the slightest flaw in beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "there has never been such a dirty election, not even under Yeltsin."
After last weekend's demonstrations, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, continues to be banned, according to his adjunction.
"The Russians have been left with a homo sovietica mentality"
Behind these parliamentary elections, with simple tense expectations, two far more open questions are being profiled:
- "Who will succeed Putin as president?
Yesterday, the official paper published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates may be introduced to the public until 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third consecutive mandate.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, which will choose the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the parliamentary elections as well as the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"Russians have been left with a homo sovietica mentality, they do not feel like masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University notes a more distant context: civil society has gained, in this country, baptised for five centuries after Europe; the famous common spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not about terror, but about some economic well-being," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Endowment.
Russians are now "voluntarily resolutely resolutely giving up the personal responsibility" they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon affects all social classes, including the business world.
Even the clerical elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 russian regional heads) are run by local candidates from The United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Cheredničenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them?"
Loaded memory
After more than 60 years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which recount the fates of the 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, are open to the public.
So long, 47 million archival documents stored over a length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have been accessible until now only for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or her beneficiaries.
Eleven states charged with managing the archives - including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratifying this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
Free access by historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to examine "especially the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of some information.
Such as the expected homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation victims.
Registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants compiled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labor subjected to civilians, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are engaged in tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Berlin's Technische Universität, said in 2006.
EU and India want to achieve a free trade agreement in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already close to €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, announced European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to open negotiations to sign accords de libre échange (ALE) agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is already close to €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, only the EU's ninth trading partner.
"The FREE Trade Agreement will greatly boost both economies" and "India will gain better market access for 450 million prosperous Europeans," peter mandelson demonstrated.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the top 10 products exported by India, the European Commissioner has stated. The Asian and European giants exchange "€47 billion in goods" and "ten billion euros in services" annually, Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, said this week, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential." The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England raises concerns and bids £10bn in five-week auction
The Bank of England signaled on Thursday that it intended to allay current fears that credit market conditions would deteriorate again and announced a £10bn bid in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an offer that has been in place for an unusually long time.
"In an effort to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty in how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will start on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," it said in a communiqué.
The Bank has stated that £10 billion (€14 billion) will be placed on the financial market at 12.15 GMT on 6 December until 10 January at the base interest rate.
This appears to be the first time the BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They normally last a week.
The BOE adds in its communiqué that it "remains prepared to take further measures to keep the interest rates" of interbank loans at the same level as its base rate on a daily level.
The inter-day interbank interest rate was at 5,829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest figure since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market have been linked to fee rates by the Bank of England, which have discouraged banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to some speculation, boosted by developments in the pound's exchange rate against the euro, many opted instead for sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire) and NC (Nouveau Centre) refuse to address the Socialists' (PS) proposals on purchasing capacity
On Thursday, the UMP and the Nouveau Centre refused to discuss individual paragraphs of the Socialist Buy-to-Let Bill, which amounts to rejecting the text.
The text of the bill was put on the agenda as part of the so-called "bill". socialist "nests" (meetings initiated by individual parliamentary groups)and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS Presidency, among which were an increase in the employment premium of 50%, the renewal of fluctuating TIPP, a transport cheque or rent regulation.
As the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the session ended after a general debate that became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more vivid, between the majority and the opposition, hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on the purchase of the buy-out.
The ps's chief of deputies, Jean-Marc Ayrault, has announced that his club will rescheduling the proposals in their completeness in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Bill, which will be debated by the House next week.
A new festival is being born
Following much speculation that C3 Presents is in Philadelphia to be forming a new festival, this promoter/producer announced the Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the Republic Festival by British organizer Melvin Benn.
"It's an honor for our company to work with the person who inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration," said Charlie Jones of C3, Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago's Lollapalooza festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people every year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, licences and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
C3's Charlie Jones calls Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he has ever experienced and says his firm and Melvin Benn's firm are working together to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We originally chose Philadelphia as our market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current leadership of the city, we are mired in politicking, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to establish a great festival in an exceptional place that will end up serving the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005, after excelled on the festival scene in 2002 by hosting the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in an urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model of the festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in green spaces in cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a certain way so that we can create both the impression of a rural festival across Europe and urban america."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The municipality of Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the realisation of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but claims that "they are advantageous enough to allow investment in such an event and to welcome a festival that will hopefully last for a long time."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high," similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which can hold 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed when the program is yet to be printed.
"Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music there will be varied to attract a wide range of audiences if possible," says Carlie Jones.
Partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award in the last edition of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to lure Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself opposes it...
This persuasion mission is one of the delegate's tasks.
But his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to fall into the claws of the "Governor"?
"We have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go.
Our role is to offer those that they consider the best," he said.
Chasing festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether it's festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco, it's about introducing, drawing attention to, and ensuring that directors give interviews.
The Age of Darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Annual Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Annual Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also presented four short-lived and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon on the stock market at the end of the year? Experts divided by 'subprime' crisis
With less than five weeks to go until the end of the administrative year, investors are already shaking hands with me in anticipation of a traditional year-end marathon.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif banka considers that 'statistically speaking, december is a positive month on the stock exchange'.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts solely on the basis of statistics, especially since, in the current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, certain doubts'.
These experts do not expect the stock market to move in the final weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income affected by the effect of a turnaround to quality securities, both in long and short periods."
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will be more calm, not without volatility, "primarily because the impact of a likely fall in FED (Federal Reserve) rates is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of stimulus to inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI bank in Spain, agrees that this is not the time for bold declarations that a marathon will take place.
"There's not much reason to be happy," assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the highs recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year slightly closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolio regrouping and traditional supplementary pension deposits, which occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that things will be a little different this year, as he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after a long weekend to mark Constitution Day.
The analyst in question does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound in the index, induced by reports from the US about the consequences of the credit market crisis."
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles to ensure that Ibex is brought to the new maximum dimensions.
Intermoney's Solana confirms that "this year is the turn of the strong titles."
This expert would include both large banks and some construction firms in the portfolio "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves at this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been re-taking positions for several months now, and we hope that other construction firms, such as The New York Times, will be in a position to take over. Ferrovial and the FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also do very well, even if they are not very well represented on the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been only two months of declines.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January). and whether he can have his marathon at the end of the year.
200 Popular bank branches will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of 200, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches, operated under the Popular Max brand, are a big change for the bank.
So are the other Spanish entities, as they are the first group to decide to make such a jump and bet on the 24/7 opening hours of their branches until 8.30pm and open on Saturdays from 10am to 8.30pm.
BBVA, another group that has also assured several times that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided to do so.
In the meantime, it intends to enter into an agreement with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturdays in exchange for an extension of opening hours by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of popular bank's experience will be crucial for other entities to join this initiative, which supports store opening hours or not.
This is precisely the aim of the project set out by Popular Bank.
Get individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, sole traders and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches across Spain within about 18 months, as this is not an opening of new branches, but only an adjustment to existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches it already has in business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
This complements the extension of opening hours with a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
Ángel Rivera, the bank's commercial director, assures that this restructuring will not mean a major investment, but more recruitment, as it moves from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches in Madrid's Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía streets have been selected, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a lucky choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 immigrant specialists, operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and public holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, with many of its branches offering a wide range of non-final products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our clients', rivera says.
They just agreed with Telefónica to sell cell phones through external personnel.
Telecinco doubled the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time on the stock exchange
We did it.
With this statement, Paolo Vasile, Telecinco's executive chairman, expressed his satisfaction at the close of trading yesterday, stating that the television he runs had doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'what I'm sorry about is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we fell less', he said.
And he stressed that due to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco closed trading yesterday with a 2.54% move.
This profit pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The stock value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) according to Bloomberg data, it amounts to €4,488.88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and has fallen 40.5% overall since January, is worth half the value of 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were valued is 3.571 billion for Sogecable, 2,518.53 million for Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion for Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antena 3 is offered because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we will evaluate it in terms of ratings'.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first television channel this year to surpass a billion gross advertising revenues, as Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising arm, assured.
If the predicted figures were indeed reached, the TV channel would see advertising revenue increase by 3.6% this year, compared with 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, Antenus 3's net sales increased by 1.6% (reaching 734.4 million) in the first nine months of the year, while antenuity's net revenue grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One factor that analysts focus on is telecinco's best relative development on the stock exchange is the increased payout it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, distributed 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is too early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to whom we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at this point.
Lehman Brothers recently lowered its profit estimates for Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected revenue growth has stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antely 3's projected profit by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both titles primarily on the basis of increased dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid: rate Telecinco (hoard) better than Antenu 3 (keep) due to its 'numerous advantages' and growth in trade.
3.
JPMorgan: in both cases, it recommends not overestimating them, as they face 'similar threats' (an oversumident market and a deteriorated economic environment).
Congress approves MiFID transposing from November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that ended today with a congressional vote on amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has subjected a public hearing to an order developing a new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
Party leaders agreed on the efforts of members and senators to negotiate and agree the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of entities needed for the efficient functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which is regulated by the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and supporting cooperation between the various supervisory bodies of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial advice services to be provided to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI) that join securities companies, securities intermediary offices and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the performance of operations with financial instruments is increasing by connecting multilateral trading and order internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets to compete with current stockbrokers.
Furthermore, the act obliges investment services firms to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and risk management methods on the market and requires a statement of all operations carried out to simplify supervision by the CNMV.
During the congressional commerce committee hearing, several modifications were included, including that securitised claims be considered a "complex" financial instrument given the high risk to investors that has been demonstrated by what happened in the US with high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
Moreover, the transposing of the Directive has been used to legally set out the functions that bachelors in ecocommy and corporate governance can hold 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of a royal decree outshoting professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading services and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices in Spain developed during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This forecast shall be calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
Spain's INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily agree with the final data, which will become known on 14 December this year.
"The ISC will continue to maintain a relatively high level"
Pedro Solbes, the second deputy prime minister and economy minister, said november's increase in the ISC to 4.1% was a "temporary figure", but he also predicted that the price index would remain at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in congressional documents that "even if it is not a favorable figure," Spain's inflation differential vis-à-vis the monetary union has been "more or less" the same over the past two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a large increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Economy Minister said of the data presented today.
Virgin plans to raise €42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have plummeted by more than 50% to £12bn (€16.8bn).
At the time, the bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually declined over two and a half months of client mistrust even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for the money and extended it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity's name with its Virgin Money brand name, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenue generated by UK banks over the next three years to raise the remaining £18 billion to reach the £30 billion target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the UK for his striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about €70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its resolution.
Northern Rock This week flagged an offer from Virgin, a consortium that makes up three other companies, as one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged construction corruption
In the early hours of this morning, the Civil Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcia city of Totano (from the People's Party) for his alleged involvement in corruption in construction, which was revealed this week.
In addition, one of the town hall secretaries and the head of the local police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current People's Mp and until then mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER TELEVISION, could have been the 'head' of the company.
Officers continue to monitor city hall buildings and the construction commission, and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the prime suspect in the construction corruption practices, was indicted, which was revealed earlier this week.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'People's' MP Juan Morales, who was under review, was arrested as he left Morales' residence with important documents linked to corruption.
Moreover, according to investigative sources, morales' alleged collection of commissions for his signature of a construction agreement with a Galician construction company reclassifying 200 hectares of land is under investigation.
Eight people are currently in custody.
Bono accepts offer to lead Toledo's PSOE list and, if they win, preside over Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted an offer by The Socialist Prime Minister and Secretary-General José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) list in Toledo in the next general election and become president of Congress if the Socialists win the general election.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE's secretary for the organisation, José Blanco, and Bono himself, following a meeting with Zapater at the party's federal headquarters at noon today.
The chief executive justified the offer to the former minister, saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best."
He also noted that "yes, it seems" that this La Mancha politician will be the Socialist party's candidate for president of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Maríno as president of Congress, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run in the next general election and abandon his active political career to fight climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister had constantly urged him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He went on to say that just as citizens know who will be deputy economy minister if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent manner" who would preside over Congress.
If Bono wins the job, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect, not a schmeming or shouting house" and to "become more and more like citizens."
"Unfortunately, sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid where you cannot speak in peace and quiet is Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate has been interrupted 26 times on one occasion".
Likewise, he spoke with praise for the current President, Manuel María, and "his good work", and he did not want to imagine himself in his place, so as not to depreciate himself to what his opponents might consider "greatness."
Climate propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change is subjecting both those who view its predictions with skepticism and those who prefer other political and social struggles to merciless persecution, it must show firm coherence.
Moreover, to have a movement leader who is prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet."
This proposal forces him to explain why his government's action or inaction has contributed significantly to Spain's lead in the European Union in its failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spaniards what measures he intends to take to slow climate change.
Which companies will be harmed by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences will be.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays to save the planet.
But we haven't had explanations like this, and we won't.
Precisely because sacrifice and pay must be made.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Dear, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one petrol price censor, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapatera in terms of elections that he was quick to reject it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet so that it does not cost anything, with pure propaganda, passwords devoid of any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
And covenants with the planet; this gentleman is so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, blames, demands nothing, but is an ornament of meetings and arouses tenderness.
If he's limited to being a virtual contractor and doesn't ask us to ride a bike and cool off with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totany arrested on suspicion of corruption in construction
As investigative sources reported, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcia city of Totano, the "people's party" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a hospitality entrepreneur, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and taken to the town hall, where he is now located, along with a number of police officers, who also appeared before the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for The Management of Industrial Land and Apartments.
The three arrests were added to six last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation to reclassify more than 2 million hectares of farmland as suitable for development, so that the Galician company Nuaria could build 4,000 homes there after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but are being charged in a summary trial in the court of first instance of the city of Totana.
The first six arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totana and now a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
His ex-wife, a real estate agent registered in Totana today, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the autonomous region's capital, were also charged.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of nuaria group, lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, a company belonging to the group through which bribes were handed over.
The investigation is being carried out by the Criminal Investigation Group in the construction of the Operational Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrests, have also carried out eleven searches, mostly in companies related to the arrests, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Province of Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, in the area of a well-known owner of a poultry meat products company who could serve as a broker.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcia city of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was to double the population of the municipality, which has a population of 25,000.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which support the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking on Coruňa, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is engaged in direct marketing, and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's edition of helsingin sanomat, finland's most important newspaper (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper published on 18 November, the same day that the criticism of Blackburn's book happened to appear:
"The content of the philosophy course has infiltrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted plato and Nietzsche's works in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the councillor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of the Journal of Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical stance on Plato, arguing that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools."

One colleague informs about the introduction of the offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a felony with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you shop for boards worth less than 400 euros, it is considered a mere offense (§ 623.1).
B. If you steal up to €1,000 from the store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than to shift compacts.
Participating in a riot has a rate of three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for replacing compacts would be a rate of six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film to a DVD pursuant to Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. Unauthorised distribution of copyrighted films is more punishable than the provision of pornographic material to minors (Section 186).

My attending physician is sticking me with one of his articles on strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings that a monthly paycheck generates for employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomography and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of life&brain's Neurocogic View group in Germany: "The greatest activation occurred when the researcher reacted correctly and his colleague reacted incorrectly."
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received equal pay, activation was moderate, but when one got double, activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Applicant for the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly pursuing balkan war criminals from the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate expires at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the massacre in Srebrenica that killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary film "Karlin's List"(2006, not mentioned in Spain) took over the title of the documentary film, which follows the work of a Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in pursuit of escaped criminals and pressure on the respective states to close the net.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Car insurance to protect drivers in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense that depends on various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of the driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the appropriate car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured person.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract stipulating that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed insured amount of a certain amount for taking charge of the payment of damages in the event of an insured event.
Premiums are the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of the driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the greater the likelihood of an accident, the higher the premium rate.
For this reason, both the over-25s and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of inspections, insurance companies concluded that persons living in marriage have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of journeys and thus the likelihood that it will have an accident.
Increasing the frequency of rides increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the price of premiums.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well in order to choose the insurance that best corresponds to his profile of the insured person.
Here we will show the most important variables for choosing one type of insurance, which, in addition to complying with the type of insured person, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 face various disadvantages, such as little driving experience and short driving licences when they want to negotiate premiums at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks at a discount of premiums in order to obtain insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the client's participation in the payment of the insured event.
"The part of the insurance claims provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the price of the premium, which will be all the higher the lower the deductible," explains Luis Noguera, Chief Executive of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other road users by insuring the client against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
recommendation.
If you're under the age of 25, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to lower premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
Malus, on the other hand, is an increase in that base rate.
"The bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," explains Noguera.
After crossing the 25-year limit, drivers have it easier when they go to take out insurance, as the client's risk index decreases, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of pre-earned experience when a crash occurs, nor can they drive," assures the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, when the "fear of the newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to take out insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be the clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a discount of the premium (which could amount to 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford luxury to get the highest discount", says Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to take out insurance against all risks at a discounted premium (which amounts to EUR 150) or insurance extended to other participants if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would suit us best in view of our personal situation.
Celtic are trying to earn a point at AC Milan, which means eight finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strength this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an attempt to earn the point they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, as it would mean being first for the Italians and would decide the scots' place.
The Italians are ten points ad from the top of the table and have already secured promotion in the fifth game with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but they need one more to make sure they do not get ahead of Shakhtar with six points, who will play Benfica, who have four.
The two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round is over, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will play for the 13th time in the semi-finals, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and a tie at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems most likely, although both teams will try to compete for victory as the Italians will not want to play on home soil and Celtic know that after the win they would be first and would secure a better place in the eight finals.
Gordon Strachan's team could even lose if Shakhtar do not win, but they cannot rely on that, as the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow last week (2-1) but won in their first straight match (2-0), will advance with the same number of nine points.
And so AC Milan's players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who are confident of reaching the semi-finals of the reorganised Champions League for the second time, just as they were beaten in the same match in the last competition by scoring Kaká in extra time (1-0) after a 0-0 win in the regular season.
The hope that the Rossoneri will win will be Shakhtar, for whom victory is only worth it if Celtic lose, both for reaching the eight finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being last and not able to continue in Europe's top competition, could reach third place with one victory, so they would play in UEFA.
20,000 people attended the first spice girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver (Canada) in front of 20,000 spectators since they split in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they opened their concert at GM Place stadium in Vancouver declared that reuniting their band was "great."
About 20,000 people bought tickets to be present at the concert, which also included a video that recounted the band's history, which caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as their new album, released in Spain by EMI, is released, bringing a selection of their main successful tracks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage adorned with bracelets given to them by their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though a nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that she "didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what she's going to think of the show."
"Sports Spice," whose departure from the band in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also expressed her nervousness when meeting with reporters two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that world public opinion had changed, opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made up my mind," Chisholm said of reuniting the group she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver in a Virgin Airlines special.
An army of nannies was expecting them at the airport on arrival.
Five have a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5-7).
He will perform in Madrid on 23 December.
Fears of a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A dispute over gas prices is currently underway between Russia and Ukraine, increasing the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is routed through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely watched.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced supplies to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, try to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused gazprom's supply to ukraine to be reduced in January 2006.
This caused a crushing fall in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom is replenishing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS 'must control foreign staff'
The comptroller said nhs scotland must improve criminal record checks on non-European staff.
The recommendation from The High Audit Office president Robert Black came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate picture of the amount of foreign staff it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key inspections were carried out in order on a sample of five health authorities.
In the immediate aftermath of the Glasgow Airport attacks in June, the President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in personnel from outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after a Jeep was drove into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court via video link accused of links to bombing attempts in the UK.
NHS chambers are expected to check foreign staff for qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK before they are employed.
Although the Scottish Health Boards use Disclosure Scotland for criminal records checks, the agency has no power to obtain such information outside the UK.
The Supreme Audit Office's report says, among other recommendations, that commissions should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which help employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS was in many ways in line with its own pre-employment vet policy, but added: "Our report highlights areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information on the number of foreign staff is available."
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "highly unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS staff who could commit an act of terrorism in the future.
"The report suggests that current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what additional value these comments will bring," he said.
Scottish Health Authorities said they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the President of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures are likely to be higher also because commissions have had trouble identifying staff with residence permits.
The survey also found that the control procedures in place for NHS bodies in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing the policy and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign NHS workers.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this job in the wake of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with health commissions, would consider the report's recommendations and ensure that best practices appeared in updated guidelines for pre-employment checks on all staff - including foreign staff - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, collected five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including best picture.
Also winning awards were star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller Notes of scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting British film on the world stage.
The awards were presented at the Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £3 million.
But he won dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree, two awards - for best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film - as Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the best documentary award.
Viggo Mortensen won the best actor badge for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Croenberg's London thriller East Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, won the Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another indiana jones episode - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of the award, which is named after Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened doors for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury that judges, actors and festival organizers.
Bif advocates and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as on clerics and security forces.
State television, the world's largest oil exporter, reported that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, an ally of the United States, since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on an oil rig in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia has been building a 35,000-strong rapid response force to defend the facility since al-Qaeda's failed attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted an internal ministry statement: 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who slipped into the country.
It also said the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
The 22 detainees were supposed to be preparing the murders of clergy and security personnel.
The government urged clerics to do more to prevent The Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied forces and a US-backed Shiite government that conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - backed by calls by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to target the pro-Western Saudi government - targeted foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," an internal ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested to promote "Takfiri thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostasy.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
Climate on Venus may be a glimpse into earth's future
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from a orbiting European station shows that the planet is even more similar to Earth's willful twin than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit similar paths, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the runaway greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and a lower rate of rotation sent Venus down a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it's ravaged by storms and hurricane-force winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a spate of how the Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, from Oxford University's Department of Physics and one of the heads of the Venus Express mission, said: "It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from on Earth, even though the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began, like Earth, perhaps even with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police seized "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it's not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, the Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a YouTube debate in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them over to the candidates for broadcast.
None of the questions aired wednesday, November 28, were as comical as a snowman asking Democrats about global warming in the other side's YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time reflected much about the state of the Republican Party heading into next year's elections.
It's unclear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the debate's sponsors, selected clips that were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the strongest Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something gratifying: the announcer noted peaks of approval as candidates talked about a hard border approach.
The toughest and longest exchanges took place between Rudy Giuliani, the state's leading candidate, and Mr. Romney, who poked his way forward in key early voting in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work on his home.
The two struggled particularly fiercely when interviewers asked if any of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal status and citizenship).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on the subject.
None of the two stand a chance of being nominated, but both remain in the game perhaps because they started sounding the alarm about immigration sooner and harder than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have roughly the same view: greater austerity at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This issue, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other worries about the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the divide between libertaries and Christian conservatives.
But the debate got very uncomfortable when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported firearms possession in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether simulated heating techniques should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbled through it to the point that, even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn't literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale after all.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now at the top of all assumptions in a recent Iowa poll because of his longstanding Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Pressed on whether Jesus would agree, he said Jesus was too smart to run, earning him a laugh.
The fight remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's surge in Iowa coincides with recent fundraising successes and Ron Paul's loud cheers at Wednesday's debate.
These two have bounced back because both wings of the party still cannot agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with a winning message about American greatness on his lips, blinking at both wings of the party.
This time, the party is divided, and the result is far from clear.
Labour's Pains
Gordon Brown again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
No orders seem to have been sold, no bills at the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers have been sucked in.
But a barricaded Gordon Brown would have done without discovering that some wealthy businessman had masked contributions to the ruling Labor Party of £650,000 ($1.3 million) under other people's names for four years, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling an election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision was not influenced by the polls, there was hope that he would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly funny deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats put it, the once-feared Mr Brown went from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The clumsy rescue of troubled bank Northern Rock showed weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
Ill-thought-out proposals to change the tax code brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data to 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative bedity.
A trio of retired generals started a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, claiming that being commander of the armed forces was a part-time job.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's general secretary (and their former internal discipline watchdog), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards his end.
Despite this, governments can reach a tipping point that they find difficult to govern.
People don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually shift their distrust when a new group takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and may not be in office for long, this is a push away: the civil service is becoming leaky, ministers are starting to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one respect, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because he cannot take the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the IRS records are linked to the decisions Mr Brown made as Finance Minister.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blairite troubles, such as a long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "ranks for money," voters may well think he was.
Yet Mr. Brown's peddling isn't as bad as it looks.
These mistakes aren't as terrible as the Conservatives are doing.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been outright deceived.
And the treatment, painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm, and slightly brutal government.
The latest uproar over political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr Abrahams, who compares his donations to charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but it wasn't his decision to make.
The laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who might buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew about Mr Abrahams' progress but did not know it was illegal, will certainly be thoroughly questioned; so did Jon Mendlesohn, labour's chief money-raiser, who learned of the tricky donations in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not involved; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these plots, even though the main part of the payments took place only after his arrival in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He was quick to condemn this violation by his own party, but he diluted his resolve by reaching for a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it's a police matter.
There are also other things that Mr Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and making progress with a real reform of party funding.
This would require Labour, which is in a tight spot, to work with the Conservatives and perhaps give up their special financial relationship with the unions - a bitter pill for a dedicated party member like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back the electorate; and the only way to win is with unassailable integrity and high integrity.
Card Sharks
Is the sub-mortgage crisis affecting the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, naturally the dorsal fins begin to smourdev excitedly around.
Now that the US real estate market is withering, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Goldman Sachs analysts say credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other variants of consumer credit become infected from sub-sub-mortgages.
The signs of tension are palpable.
There is an increasing number of default cases (with more than 30 days of payment delay) and written-off accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable).
HSBC announced last month that it had lost $1.4bn in the US consumer credit market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
But it is too early to panic.
Written-off bills and inability to repay are still scarce.
According to moody's, the 3.89% insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below average.
The deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
A change in us personal bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which account for a large part of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of depreciations) would therefore increase regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers have deteriorated.
The sector also has a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts each month.
And confidence in credit card-backed securities is solid, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of towergroup, a research firm, predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct ways to spread the infection between the sub-mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when real estate equity loans run out, consumers are more likely to get into debt through credit cards.
But credit card issuers are looking at cash flow rather than the value of guaranteed items, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean a change in borrowers' credibility.
They may even be advantageous for lenders.
Consumers' incentives to pay off their mortgages decrease when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards moves up the list of repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond faster and more flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risks of a rapid change in the prices of the guarano items.
"It's not going to happen that one beautiful morning we just rethink all the loans," says Gary Perlin, chief financial manager at Capital One.
While the risk of sub-mortgage-style explosions is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will be in for a darker future.
Watch out for those dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers to stand trial for their roles in a fraud related to enron's former chief financial manager Andrew Fastow changed their story on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud, in which he and Fastow were to participate in a financial fraud in 2000 -- enriching themselves at the expense of their employers -- they denied.
They were due to stand trial in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to one count of fraud.
The case of the three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, made headlines for the two years that lasted.
In the United States, their case is one of the unseen parts of an investigation launched after the 2001 Enron crash.
The charges against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron crash.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot the scam along with Fastow and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a partner subsidiary of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a series of Enron scams that pushed Enron down a spiral toward bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch at zero, but our three Britons knew that it was actually worth a great deal.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's stake in the branch for $1 million.
The incriminating bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misled Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in the Greenwich NatWest subsidiary.
But the $20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the indictment, the bankers received $7.3 million, and Fastow, Kopper and others added about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were free on $1 million bail, which ordered them to remain in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country's seventh-largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of billing tricks that made it impossible to hide billions in debt or to show failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse has cut thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pensions.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's downfall.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were overturned after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-helplessness
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel for a nonstop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles starts at $54 million.
For some of Russia's rich, however, it's small change to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in that many places because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Show, a four-day of flamboyant consumerism at a mammoth exhibition center on the capital's periphery.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors built their stalls, hoping to lure newly wealthy Russians to everything from mahogany-inlaimed yachts to diamond-enlabelled car bulkheads that wouldn't be ashamed of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked cautiously at the bright orange Porsche in the next stall.
"That's a nice car, but it's a dite and a dim against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market."
On the waves of oil, money is pouring into the Russian capital, just like when Dallas had its days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got hugely rich and went to Europe, where they were seen as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at harvard's Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.
Like the Saudi spenders of the 1970's and the Japanese of the 1990's, Russians are becoming the world's most profitable spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like Russia's.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires with a total fortune of $282 billion, according to Forbes magazine's list of the richest people.
Moreover, the local main institute in the field of Center for Economic and Financial Research has published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-class" millionaires in Russia, whose wealth totals $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London jewelry store David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are immaculate, and men are worth a fortune."
As they strolled through the halls in their evening dresses on Sunday evening, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovcova, five years older, described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at these cars, and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who was wearing designer clothes like a red carpet veteran who made Joan Rivers look like a house-topper.
The fair seemed aimed primarily at the freshly wealthy, brand-driven Russian shoppers who are willing to sit out a few hours on the road to sting around the warehouse, which blatantly mixes Cadillacs Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, Dubai apartments, Gund stuffed animals and drafts.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's painting of hand-painted blue embarotes in larger-than-life size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in tinsel."
Indeed, local vendors say that Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old by Russian standards) have moved from flashy logos to little-known limited-edition brands that would never show up at a shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires' ambassadors or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls day after day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, king koil's local general manager of beds, said he sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, interwoven with gold threads, for $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager at A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a luxury car company, said he sold three car grilles in the style of connected chain bracelets for $55,000 Rolls-Royce Phantoms.
He showed a reporter a car bike designed for a Russian casino owner that had a swadd of Swarovkian crystals so that it looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of those.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather bikes or a portrait of his wife made of cubic zirkonia doesn't have to ride those bikes yet," Mr. Karapetian said.
"He'll store them in his garage of 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean much exclusive at the moment, given the large increase in the price of local real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least fake wealth at a booth run by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company erected four British-style red phone booths stuffed with columns of fake million-dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaires' Fair.
Passersby stopped to throw around a pile of money, or to get their mobile phone pictures taken by friends, resting in the middle of spare wealth, or simply stuffing a pocket of a few million.
"You know, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey may have been caused by botched surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked a little healthier from the large windows of the local restaurant and watched the ambulance arrive at the white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon, a police patrol car joined in.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's van arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant director of the New York Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died because of a procedure done by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity police declined to provide, who worked at the 212 west scott avenue home.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and they hope toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of grief through the New York Police Department.
Ms. Arroyo had been assistant to the police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tenacious, and she worked hard," Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former New York City police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she leaves behind two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County District Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine if Ms. Arroyo died as a result of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," Ms. Walsh said.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 p.m. on March 21.
They found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, believed to be Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh did not say whether authorities had questioned Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as a practice.
On Wednesday at Ms. Castro's house, with a damaged rose shh in the front garden and Dalmatine barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door leading to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics - sat in an open garage.
Two mountain bikes hung on one side of the hooks.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo gave him invaluable help in sipping through the intolerable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should watch out for this or this,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came in, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates lead to a strengthening of the world's stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market's hopes that the Federal Reserve would try to calm lending conditions by cutting interest rates further were boosted by reassuring statements from the US central bank's vice chairman.
Stock markets jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second only to Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, said that executives must be "flexible and pragmatistic" in responding to continued pressure in financial markets.
In an apparent effort to calm irritated markets amid signs of resuping credit efforts, Mr. Kohn said that recent upsurges "have partially reversed some of the improvements in the functioning of markets at the end of September and October."
He also said that if the increased instability persists, the possibility of financial conditions for households and businesses worsening will increase.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver more fresh doses of capital to US markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid further bad news about the US economy, with apartment sales showing record lows in October.
The consequences of the financial swirl were underlined by the announcement by the investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, or 4% of its global workforce, as part of cost-cutting to offset heavy losses caused by a failed bet on providing sub-market home loans in America.
Only 20 of these sites are expected to be closed in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more-used S&P 500 gained 2.65 percent.
London's FTSE 100 index gained 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than £39 billion.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 gained 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets proved to be in full force after these funds were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7% in the Auction of the European Central Bank's three-month cash packages, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release above-standard money into London's money markets has increased as rates on three-month British interbank lending "Libor" have risen to their highest since late September - 6.59 percent - after uninterrupted growth since November 12.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will bat number six for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who is to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the select committee, who holds the post at best on borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help, and because hugh morris's desk, the england team's general manager, is starting to fill the applications for the national selecting position, albeit not necessarily full-time.
Anyone who is not ranked sixth in batting will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not.
It's not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets past the lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck rather than skill.
Not only in cricket, selection is challenging and requires an assessment that must always be subjective in the end.
Is this the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is that fair to Shah, is it?
We could ask the same question in another area, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and insight in the field, should be promoted to the commission - there is only room for one.
Who's to say which level is right for a cricketer if he doesn't get a chance to drop or go to the next one?
Naturally, numbers have a big influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
In a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he is to take a wicket, and the batsman needs regular chances in starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the collector's view is more complicated.
Last season, for example, there were many better ones that James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched like an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 overs each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same mead average, but both had their moments at the highest level and are hoping for more.
Whether he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or finish the careers of both, or it may not have much influence.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and gave good performances, five wickets and 40 overs in first grade, but it was Paul Collingwood who fought for his place at the same time, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer who is extra despite scoring 200 points against Australia in Australia. , perhaps still underestimated.
Graveney, Vaughan and Moores are more likely to follow suit after one more discussion following today's training session at Asirgiya Stadium, following their conservative instincts, preferring Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test innings of 88 in Mumbai and 32 hundreds in first class speaks to six Bopars, who, at 22, are seven years younger and have excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, Shah made just 10 runs in two innings against the Caribbean in The Test at Lord's, his home ground in Middlesex, and that, along with the immediate rejection of selectors when Vaughan wanted to re-cast him for the next match, his batting seems to have taken away some of the vigor that was so evident in Mumbai.
By contrast, the Essex all-rounder has joie de vivre in his bones.
Nothing flesss him on the cricket field, and his off-field behaviour symbolises a recently overturned four-wheel-drive car on the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He got away with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he did was pull out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched from a far away, to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is certainly better in the field, giving away his medium-fast skids on the pitches that seem to suit him effectively and batting confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm in the thirst of giving Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah won't excel if, as 100-year-old tea leaves suggest, he's the one playing here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, emusing refugees who had run out of money or had expired visas, and others hoping the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who drove them from their homes.
Mansour's bus station was already full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the papers, because of what was going on in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of militant cleric Muktada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni Amariya region, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amarija called him, saying that a local militia backed by the U.S. military had helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, urging him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe driven from his home in Sleich, northern Baghdad, by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"A day ago, several friends called me and told me that he was starting an anti-al-Qaeda militia in Sleich and that he needed me and the support of my boy.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many spoke of the attraction of calm in the capital after the strengthening of america's military presence and the growth of local "groups of biased citizens" who, at gunpoint alongside the US military, are defending their neighborhoods.
But there was more talk of being forced to return by visa filibustering and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced suspicions shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving Iraqis visas so they had to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of violence is that Sunnis have been pushed out of Shiite areas, and vice versa, reducing tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will re-instune sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Tiny Saarland, good education
Germany's smallest land plays a leading role in vocational education, excelled even in the international focus of its universities.
In only one educational area, Saarland is concerned about the same deficiency as the rest of Germany.
"I explained to a non-Saarland man yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this self-irony slogan appears on posters in Saarland to mark the 50th anniversary of the country's 50th birthday.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar-based education system, which is in fifth place in the monitoring of education at the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can finish their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saarland children are admitted to university - many of them even without studying at a grammar school.
"The professional education system is used in Saarland," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW education expert.
By getting more than one in five teenagers authorized to study at a vocational school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich possibilities in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities of studying two fields are the second best in germany in terms of population.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering disciplines.
"After the first Pisa study, we made several reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
The Government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that other Länder are taking over.
If pupils' results improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
When conducting the Pisa study in 2003, the proportion of at-risk pupils decreased from 29% to 20%.
In total, however, Saarland has not improved by as much as other Länder.
Entertainers can count better.
And to Saarland's disappointment, pisa studies do not compare knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Saarland could score points in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in grammar schools - even if the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Chávez shifts the clock
Soon the clock in Venezuela will be different than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will have the clock in this South American country pushed back half an hour.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
Venezuela's official newspaper reported that the clock will shift by minus four and a half hours under the new law compared to world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, an enemy of the US, justified his decision by, among other things, that the United States had forced the world to divide time zones for hours.
Moreover, on Wednesday local time, Chavéz announced that he was severing relations with neighboring Colombia because of the hostage situation.
The left-wing nationalist has said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it anymore because of my self-respect," said Chávez, who is pushing for a reform of the constitution, which the oil country's citizens must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would greatly strengthen his power in the country.
The row was triggered by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
Uribe "spat in the face" with Venezuela's decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone has caused a stir here: "Por qué no te callas" - a phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people.
It was voiced by Spain's King Juan Carlos, who was so upset by the left-wing populist's loud remarks at the recent Ibero-American summit that he silenced him in this way.
Germans are at risk of lower payouts in 2007
German workers are projected to be at risk of a real wage cut this year, despite a strong boom.
Experts justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employed people can realistically expect to receive lower wages than last year.
"The blame lies with a small increase in salaries, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy," Gustav Horn of the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Makroökonomie und Boomkturforschung) told Bild newspaper.
New burdens on employees may also await in the field of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung newspaper that the planned reduction in unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% in the new year was right and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Employment Agency would not be allowed to fall into such trouble again that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the federal young man, the newspaper quoted this Social Democratic politician as saying.
On Tuesday, it was reported that a price explosion in food and petroleum products had driven inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices increased by three percent in the annual comparison.
Venus is earth's twin in hell
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus earth is more similar than previously thought. The European Venus Express space probe on Venus has recorded phenomena that also appear on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortills at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have been seeding venus.
Now the European Venus Express probe has produced evidence - it has picked up electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning strikes fly from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 30 miles,' Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in the scientific journal Nature.
According to the well-known theory of the formation of primordial matter, life could have been created on Earth by lightning. Storms reportedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the emergence of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
That wasn't the case on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there's hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about 100 times denser than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500°C.
"Venus may be earth's twin brother, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, began to evolve in a completely different way is a fundamental question of the Esa mission.
Since no probe has been launched since the early 1990s solely for the purpose of studying Venus, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in the planet's research.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which were zoomed in by several articles in the journal Nature, did not just highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighboring planet is more earth-like than previously thought," Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind vortexes at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloudy vortex at the South Pole that spins much faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica in Italy.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km, it is almost the same size.
This planet, known as The Morning or The Nightinger, will orbit the sun in almost 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower around its own wass. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar (short for bar?) Earth does not resemble, scientists assume that both planets originated under very similar conditions.
Water has accumulated on both of them. On Earth, however, it remained in the oceans, while venus vanished into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, venus accounts for most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is calling for an end to partisan strife over the Dalai Lama's acceptance of the chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the feud over the Dalai Lama's acceptance.
"We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed sympathy for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
While the Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not prevent him from defending Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows that, too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) has indirectly signaled his opposition to the Dalai Lama's acceptance, and has been attacked by the coalition over it.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition's "pre-show" foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama was accepted into the chancellor's office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government cancelled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the two countries' foreign ministries, according to SPIEGEL.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the Dalai Lama's acceptance was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions that are also located in China, is trying to separate itself from China.
Schäuble warns of similar riots that have erupted in France
Street fights with police, gunfights, cars on fire. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar unrest that has erupted in France.
We must do everything possible to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not turn into violence on the street, the Federal Interior Minister calls.
Barricades were on fire, rioters fired shotguns at police. After serious youth riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful not to create social tensions that erupt into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the Hanover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person can cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to fix the problems, Schäuble said.
This does not just mean the integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we are seeing our first successes."
But caution is still in order.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French suburbs.
In recent nights, teenagers have been fighting hard with police in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
The German government's greater integration efforts were demanded by the Head of the Turkish Municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In light of the unrest in France, Kolat warned of an "imitation effect."
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be made.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "above average."
First of all, it is necessary to provide a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed, "We must give hope to the youth."
But the president of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control over families.
Moreover, many teenagers from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted, "But we still have to pay attention."
We need to "quickly allow young people to start working and educate."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained largely quiet.
Hundreds of police were deployed, and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorities reported three arrests and several lit trash cans and cars.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 riot police have been taking care of the peace.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after visiting the suburbs.
About 80 police officers were injured in the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night, the riots engulfed Toulouse.
Sunday's car accident, in which two teenagers lost their lives, caused the mess.
According to initial findings of the public prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of the teenagers.
In the Realm of Angela "Clouds"
The Chancellor's distant output documents that the coalition is programmed at the end and that we can expect nothing more from her either.
What country does this Chancellor actually live in?
After her bleak, indifferent-sounding and content-poor speech at the Bundestag general debate, we must say: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, administer.
Angela Merkel responded with one very arrogant sentence to the resent that she was too focused on foreign policy.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she doesn't want to understand what critics are up to.
In the Bundestag, she visibly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserved that remorse.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a sense of trouble in the country.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" presented herself: a politician who excels at others, who flees into foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it is constantly praised for the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but it no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
And all, such self-praise - so much immutability would have been forgiven by the CDU president two years ago.
Now she's confined to empty phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, he harms his imija pragmatism, which does not need flattery, because it solves problems.
But in Angela "Cloud", internal political problems are a marginal issue.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
She had a few minor sentences left on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel is recited when it comes to child benefit.
Three times, Merkel must start from scratch in order to utter at least part of the right sentence.
Once things get too specific, he stumbles like he's in a completely foreign terrain.
Attack Department
The Debate of the Republican Presidential Candidates on Youtube has sparked a heated debate among front-runners Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both now have to worry about the outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is evident on the first issue.
Mitt Romney is pitching to his rival Rudy Guiliani that he has made New York a "haven for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp resentment: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," he replies, pitching to the former Massachusetts governor that he privately employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are going on the offensive. With the Republican base not yet a clear front-runner, eight presidential candidates are using these DEBATES on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute, internet users filmed and videos sent via Youtube serve only as such hints of a key topic.
"This is exactly the kind of isolationist policy that we have allowed Hitler to seize power," John McCain says to his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one pushing for an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
McCain, a Vietnam veteran, spares no remorse for Romney for refusing to condemn the exorcisive interrogation method called "Waterboarding," in which heating is simulated.
The audience's reaction in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the War in Iraq nor the methods of torture are important topics of the campaign.
The audience erupts in applause whenever conservative values are tolded and future tax increases are rejected.
That's how it shows where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong then," Romney explains conishedly, asking the party base and television audience for forgiveness for being a proponent of abortion back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in plainclothes for the first time
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief, Pakistan's ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in as president on Thursday, and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to up honor the Constitution and seek the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office as commander-in-chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, bowing to international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup, the former general rules for the first time as civilian head of state.
By stepping down as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another of the West's demands.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf overthramed his lawyers after declaring a state of emergency in early November, dismissed all objections to the disputed re-election of the head of state on October 6 last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the North Vaziristan tribal region.
An army spokesman said the bomb went off on a road near the Border with Afghanistan.
Fathers of krautrock return
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of harmonia re-seized their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
The revival will also include Live 1974, a montage from the band's most successful period.
Even then, they were considerably better known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists of a performance by three settled gentlemen, who at first look as if they are just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and especially buttons in front of them.
Dieter Moebius, 63, in a snow-white shirt, sits in the middle.
To his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, who leans intently over the synthesizers, is on the right from the spectators' point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, by accident, they become a traditional composition.
The musicians don't seem to mind too much.
Among krautrock lovers, the revival of harmonia caused quite a stir.
One thing worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that while this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, it is certainly not well-versed enough for this band to be painfully missed for twenty-three years.
But why can't a German celebrate his still-living legends of the 1970s?
Especially when they value the musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, in England and America more than in their own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the Echo award for life's work to the surviving members of cologne's Can group, the hall was full of inquiring looks from German pop fans.
Moreover, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! during their speech, the audience's astonishment no longer knew the limits.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with them as an old friend of theirs at Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoration abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia, we unnecessarily overload the memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even then it was far from as influential as others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar of Berlin's Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a record company run by the church.
Rother briefly helped out with Kraftwerk, but only gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time may have been germany's most radical band.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of a commune that fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to toil as a nanny.
It was more of a life in such Spitzwegian artistic existence.
The name for the art is said to be derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir, whose badge was allegedly found in a dumpster.
Much of it harmonia has preserved.
The first album was called "Music by Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting grates wasn't just self-knowledge.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was reportedly edited in front of a record-breaking 50-piece backdrop during a concert in Griessem.
Rothera had expressed a desire for harmony members to be trained and occasionally trained.
For Roedlius and Moebi, it was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "Burning Heart".
Cluster came back to life in the 1980s and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His record label Grönland set out to cherish krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Band Neu! Roedeli's solo work was considered at the time.
The bodily resurrection of Harmony will take place in berlin's House of World Cultures.
The woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
Present will be a Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also attend.
This outlined the overall breadth of krautrock's influence on future pop music.
Harmonia fills the void of the famous group.
Brian En's line, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: "Unique true music, it has a future."
There are paintings of a producer with Harmony in a peasant's seat.
Projecting other black-and-white photos with a set of devices wildly connected by cables also contributes to the creation of the legend.
Before that, the three veterans are once again preoccupied with improvisation.
No longer by gluing microphones to organ and drums to remove those never-before-heard self-made tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three into the technique of insustered meticulous.
The choir of the House of World Cultures doesn't change that either.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, whispers are whispered under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place the sings "Aaaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never rock.
Rather than in the blues, we would find roots in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escaping artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever shouts "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmonia will not be brought out of his peace even now.
Even the most obvious is thought through on the stage.
Where does the music start and when does it end?
This question either deprives a person of his nerves or lets him experience the past moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough.
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the Balkan war appeared.
But neither of them is convincing.
The film template either places too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too moving.
Even an actor like Richard Gere can't stop that at The Hunting Party.
Good news first: War criminals Karadzić and Mladić are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is there, in the bleak hinterland of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Lately, we've lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he's starred in many sweet, unbalanced roles in cool women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences on buddhism, they take away one's appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where does a Hunter Become Prey (Why Do Movie Titles Have to Be So Long and Tangled NowAdays?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is essentially who Gere might have become if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful: a man who, while his best years were long gone, still retains a certain remarkable charm as a wreck-like monument.
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also hits cinemas this week, is just a sequel to an endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, after which one of them falls in love with her.
While it is commendable that Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this tv-shallow film turns too early into shooting and action.
The film will remain something very similar to Cobra 11, without a highway, but for war.
The Hunting Party illustrates why a really good film has not yet been made about the Balkan War.
The story of three American war reporters who go after a "fox," Serbia's chief war criminal, might become the new "Apocalypse" at another time, and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (here's both Richard Shepard).
After all, the two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the forest to do something that the army is unable to do, but their journey becomes a road to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauched and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the original also prescribes him a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can be definitively written off after reporters in the last five fast-forward minutes of the film did what NATO, the CIA, and all the world's criminal hunters have failed to do in the last five years: catch a criminal and leave him to venge Bosnian Muslims fairly.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth going to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
Yet this film has a deeply human message.
He condemns the fact that Karadzić and Mladić are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that they do not pursue persecution intensively enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so alike, women come to us with Brecht's famous poem.
In it, it is about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look sympatheticately at the sore veins on my forehead, noting: how laborious it is to be evil.".
Movies like The Hunting Party feature exactly the kind of swollen heads that indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not confined to the balkan war.
It was recently reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big failures.
One thing can be added: No good film about South Africa has ever been made before.
Almost always true: When a star hangs out in a crisis area or walks in a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Boundary of the Fault with Angelina Jolie, and Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio are made.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it must have been decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust movie - Schindler's List.
Many films must probably mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse" or "Lead Vest" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers do not have the skill needed to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he must form a sarcastically a measured artistic perspective, like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War," he said, "The only thing that matters is that some things never change.
Cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust reaps criticism for rescheduing the Olympics
The mayor's withdrawal from hosting the Hamburg Summer Olympics has drawn fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in estimating chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, on Wednesday called the decision "unfortunate from a business point of view."
No other project has recently aroused as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it "based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust stuck to his earlier statements on Wednesday that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions until at least 2028 were unrealistic.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that in early December the Sports Association would decide on Munich's candidacy for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means to us that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 timetable."
Yet this dream is not over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust's comments regrettable.
It gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to compete in the next 25 years to host the Olympic Games.
"It is too early to ruin our chances by marking the plans as buried at this early stage," HSB's president, Günter Ploss, said on Wednesday.
To resent the course of action would be contrary to the testimony of the Head of the Senate at the General Meeting of the General German University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universal Games as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg University Sports Association only nominated a candidate city last week.
The SPD faction in Hamburg's Senate parliament has criticized it for wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because it has bet on hosting the Olympics and has ruled out building apartments," said SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD was still planning the Olympics for the Klein Grasbrook area, with the entire area later being used for housing purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor."
The 2012 Summer Olympics attracted a lot of excitement in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, crashed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever combines the terms Sweden with wooden boxes thinks not of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Don't you?
Wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden cast dark shadows on warhol's list of works.
Most of his list of ninety-four Stockholm -type "Brillo boxes" are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts a few months ago about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo boxes" from 1968, internal research by the Moderna Museet museum in Stockholm comes with a result that has brought disillusionment; The six "Brillo boxes" donated to the Moderna Museet museum in 1995 by its former director Pontus Hultén are copies - as are most of the other Stockholm-type "Brillo boxes" that are in circulation on the international art market.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-and-white design of brillo soap powder paper boxes.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their originals, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo boxes in Sweden, but these are not on display at the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time now speak of fifteen boxes that rightly entered art and auction history at that time as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the museum's legendary director, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that in 1968, about 100 boxes were made and displayed in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 of Hultén's boxes were made in Malmö for exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By then, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the chief conservator of moderna museet, examined, in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and were painted oily white with a brush after their plywood slabs were painted with prime paint and polished.
On the contrary, it turned out from the structure of the copies from 1990 that the paint was applied directly to the plywood plate without a previous primer - in addition, it is acrylic and not oil paint.
"These boxes have not been authorised by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official List of Brillo Boxes," said Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not reach any other conclusions, moderna museet will have to classify six boxes from its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies"."
As recently as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would look into the "core allegations" made about soap powder boxes.
But the organization still remains in relentless silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered, fortifying themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who has accused the president of election manipulation and corruption, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers devoted to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
Hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had fortified themselves in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood trial for a thwarted coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with his 30 or so sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to be watching him apparently defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government loyalist forces have cordoned off the area around the selected hotel.
The president has called an emergency security cabinet meeting.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We invite people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said other troops would join the march in the short term.
Critics of the government called for large demonstrations against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been accused of corruption.
Manila's financial district was already the main scene of a rebellion by about 200 soldiers against Arroyo in 2003.
Because the army refused to join the insurgents, the rebellion failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, they have tried to overthrow a democratically elected government at least seven times in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes Versatel's majority shareholder
United Internet has secured a more than 20% stake in telecoms company Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20,05 % of the share capital.
There was previous speculation about a takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator's company by a further 5% to 15.1%, there were rumours of entry on Wednesday.
The financial market says that this financial institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch put another 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million up for sale.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were bought by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson explained.
In order to take over the rival freenet company, the companies together established a joint venture of SMEs.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies would settle for a stake of more than 10% on Freenet for the time being and would not exercise their right to take over another 18.49% of the business.
It is considered that the companies are still keeping all options open, in particular the possibility of further increasing their shareholding in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet regarding a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This months-long and hard-to-see game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile contract customers and 1.27 million complete or DSL customers at the end of the third quarter.
United Internet and Drillische have held a 6.01% stake in Freenet so far.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will receive approximately another 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed back in August.
