During an emergency call, the professor admitted that he had shot his girlfriend
During the emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police in a trembling voice that he had shot his girlfriend and they needed to come to their house.
Lamb decided that his &quot;sweet dog&quot; was alive and probably upset at home, and that contacts with the dead woman&#39;s family could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found Amy Prentiss&#39;s body and a handwritten message on white office paper: &quot;I&#39;m so sorry and I wish I could give it back, I loved Amy and she&#39;s the only one who ever loved me,&quot; the letter said. authorities signed Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the school campus, where police believe he shot his favorite Professor Ethan Schmidt in the doorway of his office.
Delta State University chief police Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb reportedly made a fatal phone call to the emergency line shortly afterwards.
Eventually another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the shooting at the school, he forced the students and the faculty to hide behind locked doors, and the authorities are still trying to find out what Lamb&#39;s motivation was.
The details, published by state investigators and students and staff who knew him, together created a picture of a talented but probably problematic teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent history.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, thanking the &quot;great people&quot; with whom he shared academic life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students attended courses at both at the same time.
At the same time, there were inclinations when it came to problems.
The student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaky, &quot;as if something was wrong with him.&quot;
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was facing stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave, stating that he had a problem.
And this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university&#39;s recruitment have meant that the doctorate that Lamb worked hard on would not guarantee him an automatic term of office to become an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that &quot;there must have been something bothering Mr. Lamb.&quot;
Lamb will no longer answer these questions for us.
After leaving the campus, police intercepted his trail as he crossed the Arkansas border back into Misissippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot in the backyard of a house about a mile from his parents in the suburbs of Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed Washington State Coroner Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb was going to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in this region.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city, which has about 12,000 inhabitants, in 2009 and taught geography and education classes.
In the spring he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamba&#39;s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was in high school with her friends, and he was the great older boy who had taught her to play the guitar for several years.
He was quite a heartbreaker then.
The hearts of all the girls flickered as soon as he appeared, &quot;says Hairston, now 40 and living in the suburbs of Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss reportedly dated for some time.
During an emergency phone call, Lamb said, &quot;I killed my wife,&quot; but the marriage record never existed.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house adjacent to the arm of the Gautier River.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss&#39; ex-husband, Shawn O&#39;Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.
&quot;She was completely collapsed,&quot; O&#39;Steen said of his daughter.
She was her best friend with her mother.
O&#39;Steen said he hadn&#39;t met Lamb, but he knew through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail performed at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O&#39;Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, a sweat after Lamb finished playing guitar and accordion for a small crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
&quot;They were just a happy couple,&quot; he said.
We flirted and recorded each other&#39;s jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a slain professor, led the first-year seminary and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the boys&#39; student club and student government.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty members, staff, students and community members, attended a candlelit commemoration event.
Schmidt&#39;s wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang &quot;Bright Morning Star&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;
School started again on Wednesday.
&quot;We&#39;re trying to get our students back,&quot; says LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is the day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported in Cleveland, Mississippi.
Writers for the Associated Press, Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans, also contributed to the report.
The story has been modified to reflect the fact that police now claim that Lamb made a phone call to the hotline after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims that they will not hire as many seasonal workers as last year, but the manufacturer of children&#39;s toys and products claims that it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company announces that it will start recruiting candidates this month, and will hire employees during October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to help in shops and sales, for shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his &#39;date&#39; with Princess Diana
The premiere of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
&quot;We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would be sitting there,&quot; he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, &quot;Back in time.&quot;
The film begins, and I realize that I&#39;m within reach of what might be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
&quot;Back in Time,&quot; is a documentary about &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; which features interviews with Fox, Leo Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of &quot;Back for the Future&quot; was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said: &quot;It&#39;s really the best travel documentary ever filmed for me.&quot;
&quot;Back in Time&quot; will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
The UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia&#39;s accelerated military support for Syria is that &quot;there is no military solution&quot; to the conflict over nearly five years of conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and promote inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with the foreign ministers of five permanent councils - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of a general assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot;had made this situation intractable.&quot;
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they had shown in reaching Iran&#39;s nuclear agreement in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers that show Donald Trump in real light
Some have tried to call him a person who often changes his mind.
The others waved at them like a failed joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But whether some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the election, they are failing (yet).
10 of the last 11 national surveys show that Donald Trump is in the lead for a double-digit number, and some people are beginning to seriously ask what this means for the nomination chances of this real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry&#39;s leadership made its way to Herman Cain&#39;s rise, and in the end none of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run into a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeba Bush&#39;s Super PAC and the economic conservative group Club for Growth are aware of Trump&#39;s will to persevere and are beginning to lay out their dollars to stop him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:
Trump&#39;s rating of auspices turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was already 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers stick to the initial stages.
A vote by Quinnipiac University last week found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either &quot;enthusiastic&quot; or &quot;satisfied&quot; with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be &quot;outraged&quot; from his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be &quot;excited&quot; against 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next closest in the level of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;upset&quot; if Jeb Bush&#39;s favorite became a candidate.
Most Republicans do not see Trump&#39;s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bloatedness and insults, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to believe that real estate has the right temperament for the presidency, according to Monday&#39;s ABC News / Washington Post poll.
The same number is held in the Senatorial Club of the State of Iowa, which is the first in the country where 52 percent of Republicans think it has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn&#39;t have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly 6 in 10 independents say his temper doesn&#39;t belong in the White House, according to ABC / Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When he puts on his scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is a real candidate.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN / ORC survey last week.
That&#39;s a change in late July, when four out of 10 bet their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the brightest crystal ball in the past.
By this time in the last cycle, 4 out of 10 Republicans had chosen Rick Perry as the winner of the candidacy against 28 percent for the eventual nomination of Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a number of GOP voters see Trump&#39;s campaign as credible.
Although the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still defeats almost everyone.
Some scholars point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump&#39;s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct battle between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always gain majority support.
He leads over Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubi by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He&#39;s in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the trader by a wide 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The bare majority of Donald Trump&#39;s supporters say they have already made up their minds.
A new Tuesday CBS / NYT poll shows that only more than half of voters who support Trump say they will not change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change that, and no one can really say they would never change their minds.
46 percent say they keep the back door open for change between candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump&#39;s current strongest opponent is his outsider fellow neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
6 out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico &quot;rapists&quot; in his campaign announcement, immigration has remained the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear that Trump&#39;s bloating will lure key Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC / Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the topic of immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will remain as well.
Government frustration is reaching new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now receive about half the support of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in Monday&#39;s ABC / Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they are also very angry at Washington.
A Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are &quot;dissatisfied&quot; and 21 percent are &quot;infernally angry.&quot;
The Chamber of Deputies supported a larger share of the state in coal fees.
The Czechia will receive more than 400 million.
In the first reading, the Chamber of Deputies supported the government&#39;s amendment to the Mining Act, which regulates the amount of fee income from surface lignite mining from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mládek (CSSD) promised deputies that, thanks to this, both the state treasury and municipal budgets would receive extra money.
The draft was criticized by members of the opposition, who fear that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget. The Chamber of Deputies supported the government&#39;s amendment to the Mining Act. receive a larger share of the revenue from opencast lignite mining fees from mining companies.
The share of the state will increase to 67 percent, while the share of municipalities will decrease from the current 75 percent to 33 percent.
The draft also changes the method of calculating the remuneration for minerals that companies extract.
The change in fees for mining will bring 427 million crowns more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, it should have a neutral impact on the revenues of municipal budgets, because the fee should be higher.
Last year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget 150 million crowns.
About 200 million crowns went to municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state from brown coal mining.
The amendment also envisages an increase in compensation from mining areas with permitted mining to CZK 1,000 per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to belong fully to the municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the deputies that thanks to this, the municipalities will receive annually instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The compensation is newly calculated as the product of the amount of extracted mineral and the rate for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting the fee by a government decree may not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax, because the state charges a mineral that is state property.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money will be received by the municipality and a quarter by the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of mining of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state collects on mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
The draft was criticized by opposition deputies, who claimed in particular that it would damage mining communities and regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
&quot;It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance can improve his budget,&quot; said David Kádner (Úsvit) elected in the Ústí Region.
KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned against rising unemployment in the Most region.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for finalization.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
Thus, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the rise in prices.
&quot;On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees,&quot; the government admits.
According to her, however, the increase in fees is tolerable from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that deputies know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and especially the government&#39;s decision on coal mining limits before the law is approved.
If coal is mined beyond limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the Czechoslovak Army mine should be made after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national and economic reasons, as well as for the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Veselý will lead the Czech Republic as number one, the commitment will be influenced by the weather.
All four Czech tennis players will appear on the board during Thursday&#39;s draw of the Davis Cup draw in India, and this time each of them will probably hit the game as well.
Captain Jaroslav Navrátil plans to distribute the load to the entire quartet due to difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and high humidity, so challenging matches are expected, which can last up to five sets.
We have to take that into account.
I would like to spread it according to the weather.
And depending on what it will look like, Navrátil said during today&#39;s training of the Czech team in the center of Raja Kumár Khánna.
He counts on team number one and world forty Jiří Veselý in Friday&#39;s and Sunday&#39;s singles.
Lukáš Rosol and Radek Štěpánek will probably spin in the number two position.
I want almost everyone to get involved.
It&#39;s slow in my head, but I won&#39;t say it yet, said the captain.
Another certainty in the Czech team should be Štěpánek&#39;s participation in Saturday&#39;s doubles.
It&#39;s just a question of who will stand next to the experienced deblist, who has an 18: 4 record in the Davis Cup doubles.
It probably won&#39;t be happy.
There are options left with Rosol or Adam Pavlásk.
&quot;I really don&#39;t know who and what it will look like,&quot; Navrátil said.
It will be decided according to the development of singles.
A variant can be Pavlásek, with Veselý they were surprised in the 1st round by winning the doubles over the Australians.
&quot;He&#39;s decent to hell,&quot; Navrátil said.
I did it against Australia, and when I play, I would like to show the same performance that I showed there from the second set.
&quot;I am happy for the experience and I would like to make a point,&quot; said Pavlásek.
The home team will play in the singles Yuki Bhambri (125th in the ATP rankings), who won a challenger last week in Shanghai, where he defeated the players of the third and fourth hundred rankings.
The second will be Somdev Devvarman (164th).
Both are challenger players and ours has experience from the ATP Tour, but many times we are convinced that the rankings in the Davis Cup are not decisive.
&quot;The current form, the weather, decides,&quot; Navrátil said.
Friday&#39;s opening singles start at 6:30 CEST and may stretch due to the weather.
It is forecast to rain and the court is not under the roof.
However, it can possibly be played under artificial lighting.
They have already ignited it and it has some two thousand lux, which is enough.
&quot;It should be possible to finish it under the lights,&quot; Navrátil said.
Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Minister&#39;s Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn&#39;s debut in PMQ is very eagerly awaited
New job leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in Prime Minister&#39;s Questions later, and will be working with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be carefully scrutinized by the media and MEPs.
In a weekly statement, he called for &quot;less theater and more facts.&quot;
He also said that he could skip a few sessions that he would leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby&#39;s leadership following his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday speech to the TUC&#39;s annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labor leader&#39;s decision to remain silent while singing the national anthem on duty on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain met with criticism from a number of conservative MPs and is the focus of several stories on the front pages of newspapers.
Mr Corbyn&#39;s decision not to sing the national anthem attracted attention
Mr Corbyn&#39;s spokesman said he would &quot;stand in reverent silence&quot; and that he would recognize &quot;the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.&quot;
However, Owen Smith, a member of Mr Corbyn&#39;s shadow cabinet, told BBC Two&#39;s Newsnight that he would recommend to the Labor leader to sing the national anthem &quot;regardless&quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn&#39;s top team, citing differences in the economy, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work also &quot;accumulate&quot; after the appointment of Mr Corbyn despite his position in the European Union and the government&#39;s benefit limit.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Workers&#39; Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of a benefit limit.
Hours later, Mr Smith, secretary of shadow labor and pensions, said the party &quot;very clearly&quot; opposed the government&#39;s plans to reduce the limit from £ 26,000 to £ 23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Workers&#39; Party that David Cameron has faced in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The leader of the workers&#39; party, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas &quot;from the crowd&quot; to ask questions for Mr. Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North says PMQs are too confrontational and will refrain from both &quot;prompt responses&quot; and cogwheel trade, and instead promise to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr Corbyn says Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ if he does not attend - such as when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also abandoned the idea of letting other colleagues speak on his behalf from time to time, as he had been heard to discuss the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr. Cameron became a leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; style of politics, which was often associated with the PMQ, but admitted a few years later that it had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, the PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders&#39; judgment, their leadership and their stance among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and that far-reaching reforms are needed.

The pound is rising while wage growth in the UK is accelerating
The pound jumped the following data and showed a recovery in British wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was led higher by SABMiller&#39;s bid target.
Between May and June, GB&#39;s profits, including bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This was the fastest since 2009 and it looked like estimates were approaching when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $ 1.5505 and was 0.84% up against the euro at € 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock in the market and jumped 20% after receiving a close offer from its rival AB InBev.
The agreement would combine the two largest breweries in the world, and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Shares of Burberry were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont&#39;s latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have started to rise again.
Shares at Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said they rose $ 2.5bn through shared placement as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Shares in the Mondi packaging and paper group were the biggest drop in the index and fell 4.3% after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating to &quot;sell&quot;.
JD Sports rose 3.1% after sports company reported an 83% jump in mid-year earnings before tax of £ 46.6m
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports executive chairman Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean &quot;more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.&quot;
But purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labor costs in his company, he says.
The costs could hit plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Opponents of the Prague apartment building cheer marshmeloun.
The controversial building got a stop sign.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision to be illegal and will appeal against it.
Hundreds of people protested in front of the Prague 1 office against the building, which is to be built in the immediate vicinity of the St. Agnes Monastery in the center of Prague.
In the decision, the municipality stated that there was a violation of the Building Act because not all the requirements of the zoning decision were complied with.
&quot;The zoning decision in question does not contain certain requirements, such as the type of land, the distance from neighboring buildings, the sufficiently clearly and comprehensibly described shape of the building, the delimitation of the area affected by the building,&quot; his decision said.
The municipality also considers it illegal that some documents for the decision were issued for the originally discussed documentation, which, however, has changed.
This is, for example, the opinion of environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the grounds of the National Gallery, but the investor does not have its valid consent.
It follows from the file material that, however, the landowner only proved his consent to the project documentation for the zoning procedure, not his consent to the location of the building on his land, writes the Department of Building Regulations.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetto from the investor&#39;s company, the Building Regulations Department did not take note of the decision of the superior body - the Ministry of Regional Development, according to which the deadline for initiating the review had expired.
In any case, this is a scandalous procedure.
&quot;We have been preparing this project for seventeen years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and we respect all the authorities and institutions concerned,&quot; Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people call the marshmelon because of the allegedly proposed color of the facade, evokes strong emotions in Prague.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city center in the past to protest against the construction.
Associations and residents of nearby houses are annoyed that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was supposed to look different.
They also criticize the unsuitability of the building for the historical center of Prague and the immediate vicinity of the St. Agnes Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the project changed several times.
The original form of the project from 2008, which included a glazed façade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Monuments Institute (NPÚ) and in 2010 it revoked the permit of the Prague conservationists.
However, the new project of Praga Progetti e Investimenti with windows in the shape of faces was approved by the NPÚ and the municipal conservationists, and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the reproaches of the opponents, he allegedly never counted on the facade in pink, which gave the project a nickname for the pink and white confectionery.
A Czech politician drove migrants.
The Hungarians put him and them in the bass.
Berg went to Hungary to bring humanitarian aid to the refugees.
Along the way, he took three Syrian refugees in the car with the crew, who were said to have wanted to drive about half a kilometer.
According to him, it was not criminal in Hungary at the time, he told Lidový noviny.
We knew that law enforcement did not prosecute such conduct.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise we were arrested and taken to pre-trial detention in Szeged, he told the paper.
In the end, the politician spent nine hours in the cell.
The police allegedly behaved correctly, but communication was blocked because they did not speak English very well.
However, according to him, the prison was sad.
For example, in our cell measuring about three times four meters, 15 refugees from Syria were crammed.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people were locked in there the next day, and due to the language barrier, none of them knew what would happen to them, Berg said.
What can he no longer confiscate?
Ask the president of the Bailiffs&#39; Chamber.
On Friday 18.9. will be answered by the President of the Bailiffs&#39; Chamber of the Czech Republic, Mgr. Pavla Fučíková.
You can ask her about changes to the law on executions valid from 1 September 2015 as well as other matters related to executions or executors.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Metcash launches a campaign in the countryside to fight the Aldi invasion
While Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are joining brands such as Dunsborough-based Simmo&#39;s ice cream parlor offering tastings in IGA stores, and shop owners are selling discounted tickets to the Australian Football League to local customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when a food, alcohol and hardware retailer celebrates its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of the Metcash IGA business and generate more turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern States.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA stores enjoy a much stronger market share than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in SA and 24 percent in WA, compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
In any case, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will gain 5 percent of the food market in the two states within 12 months of opening the first stores, which took over sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
In a report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retail could lose $ 360 million in annual sales and Metcash $ 250 million at the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, and will generate sales of $ 500 and $ 600 million in each market.
The loss of food sales and volumes at Metcash&#39;s fixed price base could cost him about $ 13 million in pre-tax revenue, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan survey found that IGA shoppers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley thinks Metcash food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the fund&#39;s senior manager, founder of the Magellan financial group, said business lunches in Melbourne could &quot;most likely disappear within a decade.&quot;
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Douglass&#39;s comment.
But a member of the Metcash board is known to contact Douglass last week.
IGA&#39;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and earnings from the Metcash grocery store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational developments in the change in speculation as sales and revenue are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler has counterattacked and is investing more than $ 150 million a year to match the counter prices at Coles and Woolworths to hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip stores by adding fast-growing food and news from private individuals.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says price-fixing and retrofitting programs are taking a turnaround, hoping that the wholesaler will return to base earnings growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves fame rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a minor loss in the recent uproar over her friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise for his behavior rather than criticism, says Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, a younger member of a talented duo often called &quot;Special Ks,&quot; attracted unwelcome attention due to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by a referee, Harrison then declared, &quot;Wawrinka had to stretch one for Kyrgios and I should stretch for him too.&quot;
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after his spasm was thwarted by Richard Gasquet&#39;s possible defeat at the US Open, Kokkinakis steadfastly defended Healy.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, where he is vying with Sam Groth for a place in the second singles behind Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
&quot;I was thinking quite intensively that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little involved in the whole dispute,&quot; says Healy.
He destroyed the racket when he lost due to a spasm in the US, but he is not the first player to vent his anger on his racket due to frustration. I know Thanasi well enough and I can say that he will not be proud of this event.
But he really did very well, because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves great recognition.
He has a fantastic team around him, he also has a great family around him and I think he was treated a bit harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and fits into the team great and so on, he never had a problem with other players, he is very respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he is in amazing condition, he is a very stable and mature young boy and I in short, I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios due to an important match that begins on Friday, saying the &quot;mutual decision&quot; is the right solution for everyone, but encourages the Canberry native to return to the team as a long-term regular.
&quot;First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the match and not on all the controversy that [Kyrgios] arose around him,&quot; says Healy.
And I think Nick has risen very fast, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, growing fast in the eyes of the public, he&#39;s also made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time out of the limelight, when he will be able to think about it, is, in my opinion, the best solution for the team and also for himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Following the state of emergency, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in no man&#39;s land and Serbian authorities reacted indignantly.
Those who are stranded for an unknown time on the belts of land between two states stand those who flee violence in their native lands, pitch tents and settle down.
But there are feelings of frustration.
When a helicopter flies over them, the migrants together shout &quot;Open the borders!&quot; and they curse the riot police of the Hungarian police.
Some refuse food and water in protest.
Serbia&#39;s foreign minister says it was &quot;unacceptable&quot; for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
Over the next few days, it will be necessary to discuss with Brussels and other countries, &quot;says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The riots on the Hungarian-Serbian border came the day after a bloc of 28 states did not come up with a unified immigration policy at ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking protection in surprised Italy and Greece, and spoke with the hope of reaching a possible agreement next month or at the end of the year that the EU nations would receive more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened a special EU summit on Tuesday next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
However, Hungary did not pinpoint its hopes on Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday&#39;s state of emergency in the two southern regions gave authorities greater power to address the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum trials.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country as the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D´Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped stretch barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point into the European Union for refugees, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted that most of them are economic migrants who pursue a better life and not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize violations of a 4-meter fence the government has built on the southern border with Serbia, and also provide for longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
&quot;Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,&quot; government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs in the southern city of Szeged told reporters.
We are very clear on this: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Technically, parliament still has to approve the army&#39;s deployment, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have been watching heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs at the border for several days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban&#39;s home defense adviser, said the authorities had captured 45 people who had tried to cross the border and 15 had already been caught in the country.
They broke in through damage to the fence and are now accused in police custody of committing offenses under new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a barbed wire tow truck.
Chaos broke out at the main border crossing near Roszka, as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for processing and a crowd of people was created.
About 20 of them fit inside, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway connecting Serbia and Hungary by refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead over Bernie Sanders halved in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic National Nomination Race, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary (down 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he wants to become president, is receiving support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the main competitions, the most democratic voters say it is too early to say that they are clearly deciding which candidate to support.
But Clinton sponsors are more confident in their choices than those who support other candidates.
Since last month&#39;s CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground in several demographics, while Sanders has gained a few.
Clinton maintains a large lead among women and softens, but her leadership is narrowing.
Her support among men has dropped significantly and Sanders loses only 5 points to it.
Clinton&#39;s advantage with Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated and they are now equal to Sanders.
But Clinton still has a big lead thanks to older voters.
Last month, Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals, but now Sanders is losing only 5 points to her in this group.
About half of all Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a party candidate.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support her because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Not surprisingly, Clinton&#39;s current supporters are especially passionate about her.
Perspectives are mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, less Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate. for this work (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Furthermore, a large possibility of choice and agreement on problems is cited.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential candidacy, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to face it - a third think they should not run.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for party nomination, the most common choice is Biden.
Among Clinton&#39;s supporters, more than half listed Biden as their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for Democrat nomination, Hillary Clinton&#39;s leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs, to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number fell from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely elect is rising.
However, when it comes to the question of the greater importance of the candidate, democratic voters prefer solving problems to a greater chance of election.
As in the previous month, no Democratic or potential candidate is an unacceptable candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have good results in some key characteristics among their party&#39;s primary voters.
Most see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as sincere and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Of the three, Biden leads sincerely, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in line with their ideological view.
On all these criteria, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton&#39;s decision to use her personal email and server as Secretary of State continue, most primary Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation and say that their overall view of her has not been affected.
But it&#39;s a whole different story among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with its explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on the subject was divided as early as March, shortly after the issue became apparent.
Most Americans say the email controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent have worsened their view of Clinton.
These are mainly Republicans, where more than 6 out of 10 claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among her party&#39;s voters, the issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not think they are honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country also do not see Trump as honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump have good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush performed best in honesty.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but, as with Carson, many voters have disappointed him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in the national election
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in the latest CBS News / New York Times survey
Two candidates are responsible for half of the voters in the latest poll, and the others are seeking support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump by an overwhelming majority, climbing from 23% in support in the latest CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month, to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson fired from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, eliminating Trump among university-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorin and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, is behind along with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker completely on the gallery with 10% support dropped to the current 2%.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all together in third place with 6%.
The error rate for the sample of 376 Republican voters in the latest poll is plus or minus 6% and took place in September.
The latest CNN / ORC survey, published last week, showed that Carson improved and achieved 19% support among Republicans behind Trump&#39;s 32% support.
The latest ABC News / Washington Post survey also showed that Trump is well ahead of Carson.
With Carson&#39;s rising trend, Trump decided to shoot blindly at a retired neurosurgeon, and even Carson apologized for questioning about Trump&#39;s faith.
&quot;We need energy,&quot; Trump said last Saturday during the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Nearly two years after a student died during an overwhelming fraternal ritual in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Brotherhood of New York&#39;s Baruch College Pi Delta Dogs brutally attacked Chun &quot;Michael&quot; Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and belatedly taken to hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Police say he was blindfolded, wearing a backpack full of sand with a total weight of 30 pounds, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his destination through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then fainted.
Members of the Pi Delta Dogs fraternity did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they took the time to change Deng&#39;s clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the brotherhood&#39;s national president, and ask for advice, Police Chief Chris Vagner told a news conference.
&quot;At this point, the members began to hide their gear and essentially preferred the welfare of the fraternity to the life of Michael Deng,&quot; said Chief Wagner.
He failed to recover and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly hit with a blunt object in the head, torso and thighs.
&quot;Too many families have been devastated by congestion in fraternities, and at least one student has died each year from congestion since 1970,&quot; Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng&#39;s family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step is important on the part of the authorities.
A grand jury of Monroe County recommended a third-degree murder charge to the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with congestion and criminal organization.
&quot;We not only want to detain those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, either officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well,&quot; Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the national fraternity abolished its relationship with local branches.
This happens when the Fed raises interest rates
Rising rates will come and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don&#39;t know is how long it will take and how long it will take.
For the economy in particular, history offers a small originator on timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve&#39;s aggression in raising rates is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets will respond.
That&#39;s why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when rate hikes begin, but rather the trajectory of how long normalization will take.
There are really more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can make sure that all the fuss due to the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
&quot;The Fed&#39;s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of an era of &#39;cheap money,&#39;&quot; Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect that the gradual return of US interest rates to more common, but still low, will create a seismic shock that many might fear.
This means that there will be adverse effects.
Here&#39;s a look at how some areas of the economy will respond, based on historical trends:
Given what the market has seen in the last month or so, the expected rate hike may make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
&quot;There seems to be a trend towards a resumption of stocks 12-24 months after the first increase, which again may reflect a delay in monetary policy,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed&#39;s increase.
More specifically, the market over the last 35 years or so - most often - about 14 percent - is heading for a relatively flat rate increase in 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returns to normal after 500 days, with an average yields of the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Dolla, Nuveen Asset Management&#39;s chief equity strategist, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on equities tends to become more pronounced later in the rate hike cycle and returns begin to decline.
The recession is a fact of economic life, but rate increases often help it.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that did not yet exist that could hasten the recession.
Most notably, gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history as Fed rates rise.
According to Deutsche Bank, during 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP growth has been below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few expect it to be maintained, when it was only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in this difficult economic background could be risky and the question could arise, &quot;whether this time is different,&quot; Deutsche said.
Market participants were ready for the Fed&#39;s growth all year round, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Free Market Committee, which took place this week and ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25 percent probability.
&quot;In our study since 1950, all the boost cycles so far have been in a super leverage leverage cycle with GDP covering the peaks of the beginning of the recession very quickly after the onset of recovery,&quot; the report said.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery since the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we are at 74 months and we are still continuing.
Fixed yields have also been volatile as the market expects rate hikes and the pattern is somewhat similar to what stocks are experiencing.
The main difference is that the impact is more pronounced on bonds than on equities when the Fed changes its policy direction.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction immediately after the first arrival of the increase / decrease cycle.
At the end of the upward cycle, bond yields are falling immediately, &quot;Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab&#39;s strategists believe that the rate hike will bring the yields between long- and short-dated bonds closer together, which will level the curve.
High-yield bonds often work better in this climate, although &quot;we are still careful about straining yields,&quot; said Kathy Jones, a firm fixed income analyst at Schwab, in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already in line with Fed policy expectations.
&quot;Apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy,&quot; she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened and volatility has risen - all market characteristics as the Fed tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the United States will win after rising interest rates and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will do worse, because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the world market and their debt will also be greater.
&quot;History shows that &#39;stock&#39; quality tends to outperform within three months of the initial rate hike,&quot; Goldman Sachsve analysts said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak balance sheet companies in each increase in interest rates in 1994, 1999, 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed their lower quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to pure stock games, consumers are also benefiting from the rising dollar.
Savers can also see their profits through higher returns, but experts have different views on how long it will take.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the station for &quot;stupidizing&quot;
He believes that he is becoming more and more indistinguishable from his commercial rival
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says they are simply cheating on the British
MP Famien Collins has attacked the Voice and says he is not the original idea either
BBC Radio 3 is &quot;changing&quot; to Classic FM, a leading MP claims, and is putting fresh pressure on broadcasting to prove that they are doing something commercial broadcasting is not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public service radio station appears to be &quot;stupid&quot; and increasingly unrecognizable from its commercial rival.
&quot;Radio 3 seems to be - I don&#39;t like to use the word &#39;stupid&#39; - but it seems to be changing to Classic FM,&quot; he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, appear to be British under a different name.
So if you&#39;re trying to do something different - these are two examples that come to mind when you&#39;re actually imitating what we already have on the market, &quot;said Mr Bingham.
The BBC&#39;s CEO has denied the allegations on the grounds that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3, I would not learn on any other radio.
And their commitment to living music and making music is, in fact, top notch.
&quot;I also think that Radio 3&#39;s commitment to finding new music and putting it into new works is also very important,&quot; he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it was now necessary to work harder to engage audiences than before because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC production element to come under fire due to the footsteps of commercial competitors during the Culture, Media and Sport broadcasts and were heard by the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, a music talent show the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million.
Do you see why this program is being discussed as non-original and not particularly different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - in which the stars Paloma Faith and Booy George shine as judges - was made &quot;in a way typical of the BBC.&quot;
He added that he wants the Corporation to &quot;find a hit from its own stable&quot; the next time it starts a fun series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future series of The Voice or spending taxpayers&#39; money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales have been growing at the slowest pace since August and Black Friday may be to blame
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since the records themselves began in 2000
Internet sales were boosted three years ago through mobile shopping
Experts believe that November&#39;s Black Friday could be a reason for slowing down spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, making many of Britain&#39;s main streets ghost towns.
However, experts say there are signs of a stabilization of online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditures for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the very beginning of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5 percent compared to last year.
Experts say there are signs of a stabilization of online sales, and new data show a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
&quot;When you look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to the year 2000, the situation has always rationalized over time,&quot; Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explains that online sales were boosted three years ago when customers began using their cell phones to make purchases.
This meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to shop in different contexts, such as on a sofa.
But now (growth) is stagnating a bit, so it seems to be fading.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken over from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
Experts believe that customers could refrain from shopping before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average of shoppers turned to their computers to make purchases while dropping several retailers&#39; websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, thanks to which shoppers bargain again, can deter customers from further purchases
Research published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £ 1 out of every £ 5 was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online, instead of shopping in stone fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of a crane crash in Mecca and Bin Laden&#39;s family was sanctioned
The bodies of the 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims during the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly to blame for the collapse of construction magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of a crane crash at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. They carried the victims&#39; bodies down the street.
Dressed to some extent in white, the mourners chose their path and paid homage to the victims when the first of the fallen made their final journey to the cemetery in Al-Moaissem.
A sad message passed around the holy place, where only a few days earlier the construction crane had broken through the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the faithful.
The bodies were released for burial, and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family&#39;s construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 dead after a crane crash at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will take place and thousands of people will continue to descend on the city.
King Salman said today that the Binadin Group should not have left the crane arm up when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the ordinance, borne by the state-run Saudi news agency, states that the Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The English service of the disc agency did not report this detail, but stated that the company&#39;s bosses were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to uncover what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are converging before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group did not issue any statement about the collapse of the crane and its representatives were not made available for comment.
Royal decrees also accused the group of failing to apply the latest security measures, and lack of coordination with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
Binladin&#39;s family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and are running large construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was the son of a renegade, whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident happened amid strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must make at least once in their lives.
Officials say 158 people still remain in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million Riyals (£ 174,000) will be donated to relatives of those killed, and the same amount to the permanently injured.
Other injuries receive half of that amount.
The head of B&amp;Q claims that Eastern European traders working cheaply are already following the trend
The British are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laura
The number of trained traders from Eastern Europe is behind the growth point
The result is 200 open Screwfix stores focused on traders
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&amp;Q outlets across the country
Compiled by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to put away hammers and brushes and hand them over to employed, trained Eastern European craftsmen to work at home.
If you&#39;re good with a hammer or paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
As the British increasingly employ craftsmen to do DIY work at home, according to Screwfix B&amp;Q, head of the company.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a domestic supply chain, says the large increase in the number of trained Eastern European retailers offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix retailers, and close 60 B&amp;Q outlets.
Ms. Laura says she wants to employ more women in B&amp;Q stores because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store make better halves.
Today, most workers are male.
She said there was a need to address growing demographic trends, which show more female households making more domestic adjustments than in the past.
Ms. Laura says: &quot;Most of our people still work in our shops.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, who make 80% of their purchasing decisions.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laura, one of only five women at the helm of leading companies according to the British FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect equality between directors, men and women.
Kingfisher stands almost alone in having half of the female employees, including the executive and chief financial officers.
Ms Laura said: &quot;It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
So it was not difficult to find good women to take to us.
Kingfisher reported a drop in both mid-year profit and sales after the group took on the cost of closing deals.
The result of the Kingfisher trend, which is owned by Screwfix and B&amp;Q, is the opening of 200 new stores
The December contribution of 600 crowns to pensioners is in danger.
&quot;It is justice on equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice,&quot; said TOP 09 vice-chairman Miroslav Kalousek, who emphasized the principle of merit.
ODS deputy chairman Zbyněk Stanjura noted that the one-off contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better for it to be in standard valorisation, as it would be reflected in the years to come.
&quot;We have room to find a mechanism to arrange this,&quot; Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal of Minister Michaela Marksová (ČSSD), according to which it was to be valorised beyond the law next year.
Marks defended the subsidy by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she said was not rosy.
According to her, a higher valorisation next year would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating every hundred million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (CSSD) reminded the right that in the past it had slowed down the pace of valorisation.
The rapporteur, Miroslav Opálka (KSČM), pointed out that the proposal does not address the reduction of real incomes in 2016 and later.
The right-wing veto will significantly complicate and possibly disable payroll in December, he said.
The chairman of the CSSD deputies, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed shortening the deadline for discussing the standard in committee to ten or 20 days, even if the right blocked it.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should cost a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
Next year, pensions should increase by an average of about a hundred crowns.
According to the pension amendment, the contribution should be received by people who will be entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those whose entitlement to a pension expired in December before it was paid out.
However, they would have to apply for the surcharge in writing by the end of next year at the latest.
Pensions in the Czech Republic are valued regularly as of January, by rising prices and a third of real wage growth.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5 percent of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5 percent.
According to the state final account, the state spent 314.7 billion crowns on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more year-on-year.
Expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budget expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
According to the data in the state final account, the average full old-age pension increased by 104 to 10,714 crowns last year.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and approximately 17,000 proportional pensions.
Yakunin has abandoned plans for a political career, he will devote himself to science.
According to Russian media, the billionaire had a Senate seat almost certain.
In the Federation Council, he was to represent the West Russian Kaliningrad region, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as the candidate of the ruling United Russia party, had clearly defended his position in Sunday&#39;s election.
Under Russian law, senators are not elected by the citizens, but are chosen by the governor from three candidates whose names are announced before the governor&#39;s election.
After the election, he will select the senator from the three candidates himself.
A complication for Jakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for twenty years, as required by law.
Although the Kremlin has found an exception for Yakunin, he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador to whom the legal requirement of long-term residence does not apply.
The shooting of the Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger is over.
The last straw in the main character&#39;s resolution is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who ran out of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janžurová decided on her grandfather&#39;s life, old age and funeral.
It is clear to Jan that he and his wife Olga - Eliška Balzerová are on a similar journey.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, he wants to live with dignity and freedom again.
He wants to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from the current one, Slavík said about the story.
Bajgar wanted to capture in a comedic form a certain type of relationship in which one of the partners does not feel completely free.
It was said from the beginning that the main role would go to Bartošek, with whom he had already collaborated on the series Invisible.
Nevertheless, the actor, who appeared in front of the camera after a long break connected with convalescence after a serious illness, surprised him.
We agreed three years ago.
I let him read the script and he said he liked how sad he was.
And he surprised me that he was probably a crooked athlete.
Before, he always asked where he would sit before shooting another scene.
This time he rode a bike, climbed rocks and even went uphill.
And all in record tropical heat, the director said.
According to Bartoška, women are said to marry a tiger to turn it into a rabbit over time.
They pour some food on him, but immediately close the gates so that he doesn&#39;t think of playing the tiger outside the rabbit hutch.
And that&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to tell about our film, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was portrayed by Eliška Balzerová.
She is not just a negative character.
She is also pleasant, intelligent, empathetic and thinks well.
But at the same time, she is a usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also depicts the fates of Jan&#39;s married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Táňa Vilhelmová and Pavla Beretová - and Erik and Pepík&#39;s son-in-law - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben from Logline Production, co-produced by Czech Television and Radio and Television Slovakia.
Google has promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
The American Internet company Google has promised to provide another up to 5.5 million dollars (132.6 million CZK) to organizations that help thousands of refugees flowing into Europe.
It was announced on Tuesday by Google.org, which is a charitable branch of this Internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled part of Teliček&#39;s visit for criticizing human rights violations.
The Czech Member of the European Parliament for the YES movement, Pavel Telička, postponed the planned Thursday trip to Baku because the Azerbaijani authorities canceled the official part of his visit today.
According to Telička, Baku justifies this with an EP resolution from last week, which criticizes human rights violations in Azerbaijan and of which Telička was a co-author.
By decision of the Azerbaijani party, Telička lost the opportunity to talk to official partners and also to visit political prisoners, which depends on the consent of the authorities, his Brussels office explained in a press release.
Telička wanted to use the trip, which was planned several months in advance, to meet with the parliament&#39;s leadership and representatives of the executive, as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners, the text sent to ČTK specified.
The EP resolution condemns &quot;unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan&quot;.
She called on European leaders to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after a recent verdict against Azerbaijani opposition journalist Khadija Ismail, who advocated exposing corruption in government circles.
Russia does not rule out building an air base in Syria.
During his visit to Novosibirsk, Bogdanovsky did not rule out that a Russian air base would be established in Syria in the future.
We do not have such plans yet.
But nothing is out of the question, he said.
Russia already has a long naval base in Syria in the port of Tartus, which it has so far used more as a service and logistics center.
However, according to reports from the Russian press, deliveries of Russian armaments and military equipment to Syria have increased since the beginning of August.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from valid trade agreements.
The Pentagon says the Russians intend to set up an air base near the city of Latakia, which remains the stronghold of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia&#39;s specific military intentions in Syria, American commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke about the situation in Syria with Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday, their third telephone conversation in ten days.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will head to Moscow next week to express concern about the accumulation of a Russian arsenal near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest called Moscow&#39;s support for Assad as a losing bet.
He said the goals of Russia&#39;s policy in Syria were rather unclear.
According to him, Moscow has made Syria its satellite.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a long-term goal, but what Earnest says is not entirely clear.
According to today&#39;s speculations by the Russian press, the war in Syria is to be the main topic of Putin&#39;s speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the other hand, the Russian leader does not intend to talk about the situation in Donbas, Ukraine.
According to a report by The New York Times today, the US government does not rule out that President Barack Obama could meet with the Russian president during a UN meeting.
Opinions among the White House advisers, however, are said to differ so far.
Referring to the words of Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, TASS wrote today that Putin does not yet have a meeting with Obama on the program of his stay in New York.
Use sesame oil during a gallbladder diet, hemp helps strengthen immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When pressed from the seeds, all healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of health diets, such as gallbladder.
Some extra virgin olive oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these have been the most common cause of death of Czechs for several years.
Gallbladder inflammation mainly affects women, helped by sesame oil.
If you are a fan of Asian cuisine, you must not miss the sesame oil in the pantry, which is part of the original recipes for exotic dishes.
Unlike most other oils, it can also be used in the heat treatment of food and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good prevention of gallstones.
These are 90% the cause of gallbladder inflammation and women suffer from these problems 3 times more often than men.
In general, gallbladder problems mainly affect overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fats.
Sesame oil can be successfully used in a liver diet, which is very similar to the gallbladder.
If people want to take advantage of all the health benefits of consuming this oil, they should look out for goods from exotic food stores.
Asian producers often use fried seeds for pressing, which have a more pronounced taste.
However, the oil will lose all active ingredients, described Ladislav Hačecký, executive director of the Czech company Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in the Sokolovská region, which produces organic cold-pressed virgin oils.
The company also produces sesame oil and uses exclusively unroasted white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our press can press 8 kilos of sesame.
By mechanical pressing, the raw material is heated to a maximum of 40 degrees, and therefore the product meets the criteria for the designation of extra virgin.
At higher temperatures, nutrients would be lost.
Sunflower oil benefits heart and vascular diseases.
The Czech favorite among oils is sunflower.
The research of Jarmila Hamerská, which she conducted at Masaryk University, showed that 43% of respondents prefer it in a hot kitchen.
However, it is not really suitable for frying, it starts to burn again at 180 ° C.
It is better to use it, for example, to flavor salads and it is especially suitable in a diet in which it helps prevent cardiovascular disease.
It contains a high proportion of omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids, which of all fatty acids lower cholesterol levels the most.
If you have heart problems, you need to pay attention to the amount of total fat and calories you eat.
For example, in one tablespoon of sunflower oil there are 62 calories, in a tablespoon of rapeseed oil there are 99 calories.
As for the energy value of food, it is important to realize that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than so-called empty calories.
These are part of industrially modified products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower lasts the same as sesame and hemp for 9 months.
Storing in the refrigerator further extends the shelf life.
People know old oil mainly by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no haze at the bottom for the defect.
This is a sign that the substance has not been chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
Technical hemp seeds belong to the so-called superfoods, and therefore hemp oil is considered to be the healthiest of vegetable oils.
This label is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself, and one must take them from food.
Intake of omega 3 fatty acids is especially important.
A study by researchers published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams, while Icelanders consume 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil should be included in the diet as part of a supportive diet to strengthen immunity and heal wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential part of cell membranes.
People do not have to worry about using cannabis oil, it does not contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers is confirmed by the fact that it is one of the best-selling companies in Bohemia.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one spoon on an empty stomach in the morning.
Hemp oil is not tasty in any way, but it will greatly strengthen the immunity, Daniel Vlček from the Kraslice company Bohemia Olej advised.
According to statistics, the most passionate nation of barbecues is the Americans.
There is 1.4 grill per household.
Various barbecue competitions are held all over the world, which only confirm the success of this culinary discipline.
The Czechs are not behind either.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have never grilled in their lives.
The vast majority then grills several times a year.
In order for the grilling to be successful, we must not underestimate the preparation - it is ideal to prepare the meat by marinating a few hours before cooking.
Which oil is the most suitable for this and at the same time retains healthy substances when grilling?
In general, the grilling process itself should save fat.
Experts agree that a large proportion of oils begin to lose their flavor at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose beneficial substances to the body, which we otherwise obtain from the consumption of oils from foods prepared at lower temperatures.
However, this does not mean that extra virgin oils will not find their use when grilling.
Grape oil for barbecue, health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, experts from Bohemia Olej from Kraslice in the Sokolovská region are immediately reminded of grape oil.
It wonderfully complements the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen is characterized by the unique property of enhancing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 ° C.
Even at such a high temperature, Daniel Vlček from the company Bohemia Olej, which is one of the few Czech producers of this grape oil, describes the advantages of grape oil as one of the few oils that has beneficial substances.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains a high amount of linoleic acid, and is therefore effective in combating excess cholesterol.
In grape oil, our body also receives important unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.
Thanks to the favorable content of these substances, it helps to reduce high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
By consuming grape oil, we also help increase our external beauty - it improves the elasticity of the skin, is used in the treatment of acne and helps care for dry and brittle hair.
The chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
Not only is it suitable for the preparation of cold dishes, for example for seasoning salads, but also for the heat treatment of dishes.
When grilling, it can be used in two ways, during marinating and the grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we maintain their juiciness.
Three ingredients must be present when preparing the marinade: oil, acidity and spices.
We add acidity, for example, with apple cider vinegar and we achieve softening of the meat.
The spices add flavor to the meat and preserves the oil and gives it the right taste, advises Daniel Vlček.
At the same time, he adds that grape oil is directly ideal for marinating because, as one of the few oils, it can pass through dark meat.
So marinated meat or fish are ready for grilling, how to proceed?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are enough to prepare meals.
The same goes for barbecues.
Some oils are completely taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to linseed, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling, spread the grate with oil to prevent the food from burning.
An essential part of grilling is also the preparation of side dishes.
Practically anything goes well with grilled meat and fish - grilled vegetables, toasted bread, light vegetable salad and much more.
Chefs from Bohemia Olej recommend, for example, the Hot Summer salad.
To do this, you need: • 1 peach • 1 bunch of arugula • 1 cup sliced cucumber • 1 cup mixed salad leaves • 3 tablespoons grape oil
Add the torn arugula, chopped cucumbers and diced peach to the salad bowl to the salad bowl.
Add salt and pepper to taste, you can also taste ground chilli and soy sauce.
Finally, drizzle with a few drops of grape oil.
For an exceptional taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: it depends not only on the medication, but also on the patient&#39;s will to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person with this diagnosis needs the care of a number of specialists: neurologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, urologist, ophthalmologist, psychologist, psychiatrist and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about medical care, for example women with multiple sclerosis also need consultations, if they decide to have a child, the care of these patients also includes social legal counseling, recommendations for housing arrangements, etc.
However, all this is not enough: the development of the disease can be fundamentally influenced by the patient himself.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and does not have to fundamentally change his lifestyle.
As doctors point out, the passivity of patients frees up space for disease activity.
For example, it has been shown that regular exercise significantly delays the time when the patient needs a compensatory aid, such as a cane.
It is important that patients and their surroundings are not subject to various myths, for example, that the disease automatically leads them to end up in a wheelchair.
This is one of the reasons why the Give Your Chance website (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing Give a Chance media campaign.
The most important person in the care of a patient with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In multiple sclerosis, the saying goes twice that the sooner the disease is treated sooner, the more the doctor can influence something.
This is because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in the inflammatory stage, when the process of neurodegeneration is not yet so strong.
The sooner we intervene, the greater the hope that we will be able to stop the disease and delay disability, explains MUDr. Eva Medová from the Department of Neurology of the General University Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important for people with multiple sclerosis, which most often solves lower limb weakness or balance disorders.
Patients are worked on according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve gait, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
&quot;It&#39;s really individual, it depends on the specific problems of the patient,&quot; says MUDr. Martina Kövári, Head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine, University Hospital in Motol.
People with multiple sclerosis suffer from the same disease, but it manifests itself in a slightly different way.
Rehabilitation cannot stop the disease, but it can always alleviate its symptoms.
However, locomotor activity also strengthens the body&#39;s immune status, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another positive aspect of regular exercise is the fact that patients check what they can do, and this strengthens their self-confidence.
&quot;Endorphins are also flushed out during exercise and you feel good about it,&quot; points out PhDr. Kamila Řasová from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Royal Vinohrady University Hospital.
By influencing the physical side, we act on the limbic system responsible for emotions.
We directly interfere with the psyche and immune processes and stabilize the disease, he adds.
&quot;In the past, these patients were so-called savings, today we know that they need a targeted burden,&quot; says prof. PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, Head of the Department of Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine, University Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physiotherapy is to enable a person to remain self-sufficient for as long as possible, including employment.
Physiotherapists therefore work with occupational therapists to provide each person with a tailor-made compensatory aid.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They are in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, it usually shakes people.
They experience shock, panic, fear.
He has to react to a great burden - loss of health.
With such a sore soul, we have to go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
&quot;I work with them so that they finally come to the conclusion that a full life can be lived with a disability and that multiple sclerosis does not mean the end of life,&quot; says psychotherapist Renata Malinová - Schubertová from the Department of Neurology at the General University Hospital in Prague.
Airbus would not fly without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere.
Aerospace manufacturing is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
The new aircraft are full of titanium or light and strong composite materials, which no one can produce and process right away.
Nevertheless, in addition to super-precise, computer-controlled machine tools, in addition to autoclaves for shaping composites, you can come across something as common as apricot kernels.
In a drum resembling a cotton candy pot, the edges of the sheet metal parts that have just come out of the milling machine are ground in a pile of seeds.
&quot;No one has come up with anything better yet,&quot; smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of aircraft door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
On the premises in Letňany, Prague, the former Letov manufactures complete doors for the Airbus A320.
They are the only ones in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
Through the doors, part of which is being assembled in Prague, passengers also enter the first and upper class on the upper decks of the world&#39;s largest airliner, the Airbus A380.
A door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner is also installed here.
Accuracy is the main motto here.
For example, the company has torque wrenches adjusted twice a year.
If there is no inspection record on the yellow sticker, they would have something to explain at the Prague plant to auditors from Airbus or Boeing, who travel regularly to find out if the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
However, advanced technology has not yet completely replaced the human senses.
There are 1500 rivets on one door to the A320.
The riveters have to knock them out by hand.
It takes them two days.
They can also tell by the sound of the hammer hitting if the rivet has been knocked out correctly.
The tolerance in which they move is minimal.
The rivet can protrude above the surface of the aircraft from zero to 0.13 millimeters.
That&#39;s about twice the thickness of a human hair.
A trained touch will come into play during the inspection.
When the inspector runs his finger over a row of rivets, he knows if one is out of tolerance.
Only then will he pick up the precision dial indicator.
Before 1989, Letov fed the program of the L-39 military training aircraft.
But in 1991, none were produced.
The company had to find new orders quickly.
At that time, it came together with the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the tender for the supplier of emergency doors for the A321 model.
The courtship with Boeing was not so happy.
&quot;At the time, we were a small company for them that did not have enough money for investments and for Boeing to be able to guarantee long-term stable supplies,&quot; Dubský recalls.
The door to the American manufacturer would remain slammed if Letov did not occupy the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the International Aviation Industry Association in 1999.
I talked there about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, says Dubský.
A year later, Latecoere bought the Czech company and new orders came with a strong company.
In the year 2000, the assembly of door parts for the A320 started.
Three years later, the upper deck door for the A380 was added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing hall for deliveries to the Boeing Dreamliner.
Without Latecoere, we would not have been able to get these big contracts on our own.
Maybe we could make parts or small parts.
The partners want a guarantee of supplies for twenty or thirty years, explains Dubský.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere achieved a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
Exclusive position among aircraft manufacturers&#39; suppliers is not free.
Latecoere has invested 1.5 billion crowns in Prague since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, certification of 170 special production processes and certificates of qualification for key employees.
Without them, the company would not produce any aircraft doors.
According to Dubský, obtaining certificates that the production processes meet the requirements of customers and maintaining them in repeated inspections costs millions of crowns.
Production processes change every year.
They are more accurate and stricter.
We have to retrain employees, equip equipment and re-certify the whole process, adds Dubský.
The company is now completing the preparation of a process for zinc and nickel plating, which will replace the existing cadmium, which is harmful to human health.
Although they received the assignment from the manufacturer, they then had to adapt the technology for the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come, check the concept of the whole line.
Then we will show them the production.
They will also check our laboratory.
They test one set of samples themselves in their laboratory and then compare the results with ours, Dubský describes the way in which customers check them.
The reward is a long-term exclusive contract for a Prague company.
Today, the production of embraers is standing and falling with the Prague plant.
For the A320, it produces half of the total volume of the door.
Replacing the Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European manufacturer.
However, this does not mean that he could ask for any price behind the door.
The price curve is part of the contract.
It indicates how much one door will cost in ten, fifty, hundreds of pieces produced.
The price per piece is still falling to a certain limit value.
We have to fit into this price formula.
If not, we will go through, says Dubský.
Half of the hall, where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are assembled, is still empty.
However, it is a symbol of the future.
Behind the screen, a new semi-robot line for riveting and door assembly is being built here for the innovated A320 Neo model.
Riveting is speeded up and more accurate.
&quot;This is a trend in assembly in aviation,&quot; adds Dubský.
The future line is secured for sales.
Airbus reports that airlines have so far ordered 3,278 new A320s.
Just a few meters away there will be a line for the complete assembly of doors for the upper deck of the A380.
It is a strategic decision of our parent company.
The aim is to shorten production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could start within two years, says Dubský.
Before that, however, the company must pass qualification tests, for example, for the installation of some electrical and electronic equipment in the door for the largest Airbus.
The company also relies on the further development of production from composite materials.
In addition to Boeing, it should also participate in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
&quot;It&#39;s a huge credit for the company to be able to process composites in addition to metal materials,&quot; says Dubský proudly.
However, Latecoere is on the verge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There is no other place in the Letov complex, where it is located.
Before the French mother entered, the company had 180 employees.
He now has 800, and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing race to see how many hundreds of new aircraft the airlines order each year, they don&#39;t have to worry about work.
Although it has orders for several years ahead, the parent company of Prague&#39;s Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group did not have enough money for the September loan repayments.
In the end, Latecoere was able to negotiate with the main creditors.
At the end of August, they exchanged part of their loans for shares.
Creditors acquired a 37.4 percent stake in the company by increasing their capital by 57.4 million euros.
The company&#39;s debt fell by two thirds, ie by 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company subscribed for new shares for the existing shareholders for EUR 222.9 million.
In total, it increased its share capital by 280 million euros.
At the same time, the entire group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85 percent of sales.
It expects average order growth of four percent per year until 2017.
In the order book, he has orders worth 2.6 billion euros, which corresponds to four years of production.
The French media claim that Latecoere can finally breathe again after years of dripping.
The Czech plant in Letňany, Prague, is important for the groups.
It contributes 16 percent to the group&#39;s sales.
According to the number of employees, it is the largest foreign branch of the group.
Deputies supported a larger share of the state in coal fees.
The change in fees for mining will bring 427 million crowns more to the state treasury than in 2013.
According to the government, it should have a neutral impact on the revenues of municipal budgets, because the fee should be higher.
Last year, the municipalities received approximately 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget 150 million crowns.
About 200 million crowns went to municipalities and 66 million crowns to the state from brown coal mining.
The amendment also envisages an increase in payment from mining areas with permitted mining to one thousand crowns per hectare per year.
The income from these payments should continue to belong fully to the municipalities.
The Minister of Industry Jan Mládek (ČSSD) told the deputies that thanks to this, the municipalities will receive annually instead of 14 million to 100 million crowns.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but will be determined by the government by its regulation.
The compensation is newly calculated as the product of the amount of extracted mineral and the rate for individual types of minerals.
According to the government, the reason for the change is, among other things, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS MP Marek Benda warned that setting the fee by a government decree may not be in accordance with the constitution.
According to Minister Mládek, however, this is not a tax, because the state charges a mineral that is state property.
Only municipalities whose territories are affected by mining receive fees.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money will be received by the municipality and a quarter by the state.
The same ratio will be in the case of mining of radioactive rocks.
Part of the money that the state collects on mining fees will be earmarked.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to provide a mine rescue service.
Today, the draft was criticized by opposition deputies, who claimed in particular that it would damage mining communities and regions.
For example, Michal Kučera (TOP 09 and Mayors) warned that mining companies will no longer want to sponsor municipalities as before, because they will pay higher fees directly to the state budget.
&quot;It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just so that the Minister of Finance can improve his budget,&quot; said David Kádner (Úsvit) elected in the Ústí Region.
KSČM MP Hana Aulická warned against rising unemployment in the Most region.
Kádner and Aulická unsuccessfully proposed to reject the amendment, Kučera wanted to return the law to the government for finalization.
The explanatory memorandum states that, according to mining companies, the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices, because prices are more than 90 percent long-term contracted.
Thus, major consumers such as power plants or heating plants should not feel the rise in prices.
&quot;On the other hand, this fact increases the risk that mining organizations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean a reduction in the number of employees,&quot; the government admits.
According to her, however, the increase in fees is tolerable from the point of view of employment.
According to the rapporteur for the amendment, Milan Urban (ČSSD), it is crucial that deputies know the conclusions regarding the updated energy concept and especially the government&#39;s decision on coal mining limits before the law is approved.
If coal is mined beyond limits, then it will have an impact on revenues for the state and municipalities, he stressed.
Urban does not agree with Mládek that the decision to break the limit at the Czechoslovak Army mine should be made after 2020.
According to him, the limits at the ČSA mine should be broken for social, national and economic reasons, as well as for the long-term stability of the domestic energy sector.
Time to decide on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The whole world is watching as the US Federal Reserve plans to meet in two days on Wednesdays and Thursdays to make a major decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make a decision now thought they would remain dormant for some time, leaving interest rates between 0-0.25 percent.
It&#39;s a historic event, because it&#39;s been a while since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the main central bank could be able to get out of the bar and start the process of normalizing interest rates, &quot;said Angel Ubide, chief executive of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy performed relatively well, recovering by adding trillions of dollars to the government account and creating only low levels of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global perspective.
They have warned markets to be prepared for an increase, but circumstances suggest that they also see great opportunities against the move.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday 20:00 CET.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later his colleague later that day - wrote a message saying he was &quot;sorry&quot; for the first murder and that he wished he could take it back. authorities.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi said Lamb, a geography and social sciences teacher at Delta State University, called the police on Monday morning around ten o&#39;clock.
and he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send police officers to his house.
He said: &quot;I shot my wife last night&quot; and also mentioned that there is a &quot;cute dog&quot; in the house who will &quot;not bother anyone&quot; but is upset.
Police demanded the caller&#39;s name, but Lamb did not introduce himself.
Lamb also didn&#39;t explain why the house was fired.
When police arrived at the scene, they found 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from Lamb stating, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy and she&#39;s the only person who ever loved me. &quot;
After leaving a message, Lamb traveled 300 miles to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
University Dean William LaForge said he knew of no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that &quot;something was obviously going on in Mr. Lamb&#39;s head.&quot;
Despite Monday&#39;s statement that Lamb allegedly believed Amy Prentiss&#39;s romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was &quot;no evidence&quot; of a &quot;love triangle.&quot;
Shawn O&#39;Steen, who had been married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a &quot;great person.&quot;
The divorce took place 15 years ago, but they both remained friends.
O&#39;Steen and Prentiss&#39;s 19-year-old daughter was &quot;shaken&quot; by the whole case.
O&#39;Steen said Prentiss and her daughter were &quot;best friends.&quot;
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss&#39;s close friend, according to the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles said Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Lightning, dated Lamb for about three years.
&quot;She always wanted to help others,&quot; Knowles said.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday, saying he would &quot;not go to jail.&quot;
When police caught up with him on the highway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and fled into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to his CV, which he published on the school&#39;s website, Lamb received his doctorate in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had several stressful years.
He battled leukemia in 2001 and lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett in 2009 due to cancer.
The actor also allegedly had a drug problem and was detained in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All these things certainly take their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out of the game for several months due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double right leg fracture during the defeat of Manchester United in the Champions League against PSV Eindhoven.
While the left defender left the injury in tears and knocked him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Héctor Moren&#39;s reckless intervention in the 15th minute, when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed an oxygen mask before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: &quot;He has suffered a double leg fracture and is now in hospital.&quot;
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It&#39;s awful - a guy who comes to Manchester at the age of 18 has a very hard time, but he plays fantastically and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also wore an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I am not a doctor, but a double fracture of the leg will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he will play this season.
Moreno was very lucky that he didn&#39;t get a red card and a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall indicated that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself whether it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly operation with both feet.
A tweet from Shaw&#39;s account says, &quot;Thank you all for their messages, the words can&#39;t express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now, and I&#39;ll come back even stronger.&quot;
Related: Manchaster United recorded injuries to Luke Shaw in a defeat against PSV
The English defender will have an added motivation to recover in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
Phillip Cocu, a PSV coach, said: &quot;It was a very nasty injury.&quot;
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the goal of our players to hurt opponents.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal&#39;s Holland at the 2014 World Cup.
&quot;It&#39;s very difficult for him because his intention was not to injure his opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it&#39;s not good,&quot; Cocu said.
I was not able to notice this moment.
I only saw the ball heading in a different direction, so [Moreno] seemed to touch it, but I didn&#39;t see the intervention on Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: &quot;I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel very bad about it, I&#39;m very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron surely know The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this thing: when a child falls in love with a book, it doesn&#39;t take long for them to learn it by heart.
But you can&#39;t be David Cameron.
When asked by a child scheme provider to name a popular children&#39;s book, Prime Minister Lorax chose Dr. Seuss&#39;s fable of 1971.
It was hard to choose, Cameron writes in a report posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: &quot;Funny, touching, creative and powerful, I liked to read this to my children because there was always an image or message behind them that I had never seen before. &quot;
Well, only in the following paragraph did Cameron allegedly describe the plot of the book based on an excerpt from the 2012 film, which added additional characters and details to fill in a brief original text.
&quot;In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree,&quot; he said. a book that records the object of love unknown to Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if it weren&#39;t suspicious enough, the text provided by Cameron reads as a summary of Lorax, which is on the Internet Movie Database, and begins, &quot;In a walled city of Thneed-Ville where all nature has ceased to exist and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey. &quot;
As an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would not be familiar with the story of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is devastated by the greedy, tree-felling industrialist Once-ler, who despite the protests of the title Lorax, a shrunken, mustachioed creature. who &quot;speaks behind the trees.&quot;
Most likely, a relatively insignificant PR task was given to a helper who had never read Lorax to the child 20 times at a time.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron&#39;s supporters&#39; office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by a Cameron employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of neglecting England, but still held
Rivaling Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after watching the team that England have chosen for this tour, I think it will be unlikely that a repeat of the 3-0 defeat it suffered last time in the test series.
Nor would I directly rule out winning guests.
Alastair Cook&#39;s side may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are good spin players in this batting lineup, and the collective thinking is strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, only the youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the level of the test series, represents an offensive opportunity.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped out of the England team in an experienced series and was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to omit Adam Lyth is a tough nut to crack for me because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests faced two good attacks in challenging conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged on the basis of performance.
For example, there were no question marks around Joe Root&#39;s name, which led to the announcement because - and I&#39;ve mentioned this before - players are their best selectors.
A few more half-centuries and Lyth could extend his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he manages to get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will arise.
England&#39;s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his stance, even though his performances weren&#39;t entirely one hundred percent, and I&#39;m not surprised; he was always a team player.
The question of how much trial time a batsman gets to show is a tough nut to crack.
Lyth got seven caps - just like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and abroad.
The only thing you can complain about is that England first gave Jonathan Trott a chance in the Caribbean - even though Lyth was at his best - but this wasted opportunity is a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming and he is a batsman, whom I evaluate very positively.
He&#39;s an x-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, when he won 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which he did a little bit.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but all this will, of course, depend on the overall lineup in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen starting alongside Cook, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was raised and I have no objections to her.
I don&#39;t understand why a strokemaker can&#39;t shoot and this left-handed man has already shown that he is an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number 3 to them, and there&#39;s no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 rehearsals before his performance in 2001.
He immediately managed three centuries and did not even look back.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a backup spinner, and when I had the opportunity to watch him, I was fascinated as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough statistics - an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball - and I see that as a rowboat, but there aren&#39;t many spinners raising their hands, and the selectors have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, it seems that England has made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahel Jayawarden, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a test match consultant may be a masterpiece.
He is one of the most beautiful guys who bring rich experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on as part of the white-ball tour and will bring both energy and a ruthless spark to the team.
I have always felt that he was born directly into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has an intellect that can be used.
New voices in the locker room, even if they are voices saying consistent things that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham&#39;s teammate Ben Stokes was given a day off, just as Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not set a timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work depends on the results.
Such decisions can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy starts to stagnate by 2017.
David Cameron&#39;s ill-considered strategy of renegotiating to keep Britain in the EU gets into more trouble every past day without the election of the genius Jeremy &quot;Is it Yes or No?&quot; Corbyn to head the Workers&#39; Party, or the TUC will take place on Tuesday to showcase the whole situation around Europe.
Foreigners also have their Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A close friend of a European diplomat recently explained how Europe is drowning in various crises - not all of which are to blame - some Member States already have enough of Britain&#39;s egocentric agenda, divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they mostly did not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they did not want it even if they eroded social protection.
We can even call it Dave and George&#39;s selfie agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then return home saying they are winning allies for reform.
It&#39;s all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unseen Britain in European Europe - &quot;Don&#39;t leave us alone with France,&quot; says Berlin - suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have reached a point where they don&#39;t care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, Germany&#39;s cautiously balanced chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it becomes bad for her, as was the case with Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl ( 16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is also waning.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is difficult to watch them break their feet with the help of the British Selfie, who could better invest their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the pre-referendum campaign in the UK to speed up the Brexit process, a friend said.
&quot;Negotiations have solved the problem&quot; and &quot;Britain has nothing of value in the negotiations.&quot;
To their detriment, Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the press oligarchs are, because they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 at a 2: 1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember the name of Boris Johnson, a devious Euro-opportunist who made his name as the Brussels correspondent for &quot;EU straight bananas&quot; in the early 1990s.
Despite his vanity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mixture of tax-defective villains, foreigners hacking phones, and the pseudo-overseas departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you&#39;re in a cage with a frantic gorilla, you had to throw bananas at her so she wouldn&#39;t have you for dinner and then for tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron&#39;s referendum routine, since Blair accepted the principle of a repealed EU constitution, which was sunk by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and he was fired.
The press never forgave him either.
But dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me amiably on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he must not waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock&#39;s Murdoch boycott strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to work out coherent media engagement strategies, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair he left for the BBC on Sunday.
Corbin&#39;s official attitude towards Europe is, I will say nicely, evolving.
He claims that he would like to remain in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people beyond the furious tendencies of Ukip and the savage shores of Tory&#39;s little Englanderism can certainly do that.
Hilary said &quot;Bemm, but not Benniite&quot; Benn on radio and television this week, when his inner scout could not decide to admit that Corbyn&#39;s appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his grandfather fought for loyalty on television without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary&#39;s match was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay &quot;under all circumstances&quot; - Benna&#39;s phrase - did not seem to be what McDonnell said or what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - don&#39;t forget, touched me as well - the discipline of the news remains important in the ages of all-day television and especially in the faith, the hotbed of paranoia and betrayal of social media.
It is fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take the support of the Workers&#39; Party in the referendum campaign for granted, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell&#39;s and Corbyn&#39;s fundamental perversion to EU membership — in keeping with their Bennite besieging economy, anti-capitalist past — is no longer just a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences is central to dogmatic bickering.
As with his twist on NATO - Tom Watson is convinced that JC&#39;s campaign will not want to end this - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to understand the meaning of all this for their domestic masters.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - because of Britain&#39;s concessions, when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with Brisk &#39;s weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in reducing the cost of a conservative government in power, as I was reminded at Monday&#39; s launch of what was called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize the review of electronic published by Public Health England
The government-funded statement that e-cigarettes are 95% safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom have links to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in its report on electronic cigarettes by Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published a &quot;milestone&quot; report last month, describing it as a &quot;comprehensive review of the evidence.&quot;
However, several researchers questioned the relevance of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet magazine last month attacked an &quot;extremely weak base&quot; on which the PHE agency based its main conclusions.
Two other experts who write for the BMJ questioned claims that were allegedly &quot;built on rock or sand.&quot;
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: &quot;The fundamental principle of public health is that policy should be based on evidence of effectiveness.&quot;
They say the public could expect PHE&#39;s claim that &quot;the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking&quot; is based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from one meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the negotiations were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell say one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
He also approved the BAT Public Health Commission in the Sustainability Report, he states.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting acknowledged funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he allegedly received earlier from tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but they include several well-known champions of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claim industrial funding in newspapers.
Some others present at the meeting are not known for their anti-smoking expertise.
The meeting at PHE was also attended by the tobacco management.
The report in this group &quot;eloquently admits&quot; the lack of &quot;hard evidence of the harmfulness of most products on most criteria,&quot; McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE&#39;s claim that &quot;so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers&quot; was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said the BMJ statement had been answered earlier.
He said: &quot;Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.&quot;
One in two lifetime smokers will die from his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we must continue to examine the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and also what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS £ 2 billion a year.
By clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not without risk, they bear only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
The BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that his commercial rivals would &quot;put their right hand&quot; behind a hit show such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used for programs that are not made up of other UK television broadcasts.
He criticized the BBC for deploying public service programs, which are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, in difficult airing times compared to its rivals&#39; biggest rating show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to join the BBC for six years, working on Channel 4.
&quot;I&#39;m struggling with the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programs that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions,&quot; Johnson told the House of Commons Communications Committee as part of negotiations on the future of the BBC.
If you keep royalties that I&#39;m not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, at least the creation of programs that others don&#39;t produce or outsource should be reduced.
They broadcast The Voice in prime time because they want to get the widest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would broadcast it is a ridiculous joke, and understandably pointless.
Johnson said: &quot;I don&#39;t understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded non-contributoryly.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course made at home.
Honestly, other channels would give them a right hand.
I can&#39;t understand how these are public service broadcasters.
I don&#39;t think it would weaken the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC he felt guilty about catching up with ratings &quot;because of the ambitions of the people who worked here and because he believed it was the best way to get ensure long-term support. &quot;
His commentary on the BBC&#39;s most popular show repeats those made by former Sky CEO Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said that even the BBC&#39;s more pampered public service programs &quot;move to BBC4, where quite often the audience cannot be measured but fulfill their authority and can argue as they prepare for their hypocritical mission to justify £ 4bn of royalties.&quot; But of course we do all these obscure programs that no one is watching. &quot;
They broadcast them at a time when no one is looking at them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the commission: &quot;I urge you to find a more regressive system about who gets the best value from it.
Of course, we all think that £ 150 a year is a big sum, but for people for whom £ 150 is a lot, I would be surprised if they paid so much because they don&#39;t watch that much on the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who spoke before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should review its Reith mission to &quot;inform, educate and entertain.&quot;
He acknowledged that the BBC&#39;s small volume of production had now been classified as educational - 1% of television production and 0.1% of radio production - and should take the role of public service broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to &quot;informing, clarifying and entertain.&quot;
On the subject of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as Proms, which only a handful have aired on television, and connect with commercial reporters so we can see them all online.
&quot;Sonogenetics&quot; or the control of brain cells by means of sound waves
This video shows how sound impulses affect the direction in which the nematodes move.
Scientists have raised worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound impulses that are inaudible to the human ear.
The pulses work by switching cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasound waves.

The researchers said that these worms are a great example of a new methodology called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells and is activated outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that inserts brain-stimulating electrodes into a patient&#39;s brain. The method is used, for example, to treat the symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s disease.
The nematodes usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani has found that the reaction occurs when they are placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
As he found out, the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves that then pass through the worms&#39; bodies.
The amplified ultrasound waves act in the ion channels of TRP-4, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Thanks to sound waves, these channels open and activate the cells to which they are connected, according to a report in the journal Nature Communications.
In order to control the nematodes with ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
When he then applied ultrasound to the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is very similar to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by an optical fiber to a desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate the tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
&quot;We believe that when we use gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to the ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases,&quot; Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also find its application in the treatment of muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Ads humiliating the British arms trade.
Watch a video about the anti-gun market from Amnesty International.
Menacing killer drones!
Leg shackles that break ankles!
Shattering missiles!
And electric stun batons that cause unbearable pain but leave no traces!
The cheerful voice and caricature of metaphors leave no one in doubt that this advertisement at the world&#39;s largest arms fairs is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government&#39;s willingness to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the International Veselice defense and security facility at the ExCeL Center in London&#39;s Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also being conducted with posters emerging at bus stops and subways that require a second look.
&quot;Important Announcement, Traveling on DLR from September 15-18?&quot; reads one, using a font with London Underground signs with DLR lines becoming an image of a tank.
In September this year, a swarm of arms dealers will descend to the DLR ... Customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are created by artists exhibiting their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A team called the Special Patrol Group has helped distribute them across London and using &quot;Ad Space Hack Packs&quot;, which is £ 6 a piece of Allen key, which is said to &quot;gain access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet.&quot;
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting &quot;vandalism.&quot;
One of the advertising parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and an assistant professor at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to audiences outside the gallery.
Many artists switch to working with activists in protest movements and realize that they need to get out in the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the posters against the arms trade health passengers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was watched on Facebook by more than 100,000 people in 24 hours and was created by a VCCP agency working free of charge, and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the arms trade ads - he saw a blank space on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, &quot;Let&#39;s show them a campaign they&#39;re trying to avoid.&quot;
They toyed with creating more realistic, risky corporate ads, but &quot;by adding colorful colors and animation, we&#39;ve made it attract more people.&quot;
&quot;They did a fantastic piece of work and helped raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair,&quot; says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK Government to take action to ensure that torture equipment is not traded illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US military for &quot;an AT4CS RS launcher.&quot;
This includes &quot;a uniquely shaped warhead that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target.&quot;

Eight golden rules for student dorm life
I moved to student dormitory 11 years ago as an inattentive nineteen-year-old boy, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I bothered - and numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving to college can range from mildly nervous to totally appalling.
It&#39;s tempting to blabber: to tell people where you&#39;re from, if you took a year off, what do you think of Corbyn, and why &quot;you honestly don&#39;t love or hate Marmite, because people, it&#39;s just HAHAHA yeast extract, I&#39;ll be in peace.&quot;
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe as well - ask questions and show interest.
It controls the conversation and helps you find people you love and those you wouldn&#39;t talk to even if your lashes were on fire and they would issue fire extinguishers.
Leave people space.
People&#39;s rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night spots and communal public places, but they are also rooms where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don&#39;t even think about starting college and being in a relationship
Introverts come to college short.
Your room should be a haven, yet a lot of dormitories turn into an out-of-room walking culture that is friendly, sociable and contributes to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone who needs to charge.
No culture allows you to say, &quot;I love you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave so I can return to the energy I used to talk to you.&quot;
Try to know when a classmate is tired of socializing - and maybe write to him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: knock.
One boy in my dorms used to be invited inside unless the door was locked.
He saw a few things.
Make friends by baking.
Since you started going to university on top of a baking mania, knocking on someone else&#39;s door and performing with a plate of baked cookies seems a little less weird, less than &quot;Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile while I ask personal questions. &quot;
Offering homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk to you and maybe it will all end up adding your face to a tasty surprise.
This, of course, is the subject of being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar and lead are likely to guarantee that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock them on the door.
Food theft is a common crime in student dormitories.
Stealing an entire chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check with the milk owner twice.
There is a chance that they will offer you milk even if they rage inside.
If someone steals something from you, it&#39;s annoying and you have my sympathies - but try to deal with it a little more adult than my roommate, who exchanged her milk for a dishwashing liquid to punish the thief.
He&#39;s in jail now.
You should not make sounds that distract people from sleeping or studying.
It&#39;s not just about being a decent human being, but you&#39;re also famous people in glass houses.
A girl from my hallway asked her neighbors if they could shut down drum and bass a bit, because they were 3 at night and had a paper in the morning.
Their response was to amplify the music.
When they finally fell silent at 5 o&#39;clock in the morning, she let them sleep for two hours and then played her own music aloud, locked the door, and went to her three-hour note.
Wouldn&#39;t it be romantic if your future wife went to the same dorms as you?
Conversely, wouldn&#39;t it be terribly embarrassing if you mistaken your roommates for your future wife, slept together, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe she would also take control of your mutual friends?
Of course, you don&#39;t tell your heart - but if your sexy roommate isn&#39;t one hundred percent your future wife, try to talk at least a little about your weaknesses.
In the uplifting moment when you realize that someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there is only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it&#39;s easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about securing them by hiding something from them - never ruin someone&#39;s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and give them the keys to the water bottle, which you then put in the freezer - but never stick their belongings on the ceiling more than twice.
Eva was looking forward to the twins despite the uncertain prospects for the future.
Eva had a hard time during her pregnancy with Vítek, now seven years old.
His father broke up with her and she was alone to prepare and raise her offspring.
I dealt with the situation relatively quickly - I was very much looking forward to the child and I was looking for positives in it.
I tried not to worry about insecurity and being alone with the child.
And I certainly had the hope that we would not be alone for a long time, Eva remembers her first pregnancy today.
Even then, she met Elder Vašek on the Internet at a chat, with whom they began to talk about their favorite films.
Vašek even brought Eva and Vítek home from the maternity hospital, but he did not rush into the role of stepfather.
&quot;He then withdrew from the program for a while,&quot; Eva described in the documentary series Four in It 3.
The motif of the third series of the Czech television series is the search for happiness on the second try.
Thanks to part-time work and the great help of her mother and her aunt&#39;s help, she managed to take care of Vítek and the family&#39;s financial security.
In the end, even the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child did not spoil Vašek&#39;s affection for Eva.
They definitely got together around Vítek&#39;s second birthday and he now understands Vašek as his dad and addresses him as well.
Even though Vašek already has two adult daughters, according to his words, he enjoys paternity at sixty and also pays more attention to children.
In addition to Vítek, they were joined by two-year-old Leontýnka and eventually twins.
&quot;Vašek sailed into our family somehow naturally, maybe even because my mother never talked to me much about relationships,&quot; thinks smiling Eva.
Little space?
At least we&#39;re close.
The twins Ema and Ela were born by caesarean section after Eva was diagnosed with gestational cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder in the production and activity of bile acids, which then occur in excessive amounts in the blood of pregnant women and are manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous for the unborn fetus, which is at risk of premature birth and death, and usually resolves spontaneously after the birth.
To Eva&#39;s and Vašek&#39;s happiness, Ema and Ela were born healthy, even though they were only in the 36th week.
Emička was placed in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Vašek&#39;s niece also works, who managed to take over and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger and I had her with me right after being transported from the ICU to the room, she describes the difficult period after Eva&#39;s birth.
She spent twenty days in the hospital until the doctors agreed to release the babies, who had meanwhile managed to reach the limit of two kilos.
But the wait for the children to be brought in the maternity ward did not make Eva happy.
&quot;I was mad with longing for my husband and children,&quot; the four-time mother recalls the difficult moments in the sixth week ward.
She also considered signing a reverse with her husband, partly because of the insensitive attitude of one of the doctors.
In the end, however, this did not happen and the doctors released Eva and the twins to home care.
Stories of four pregnancies and births are broadcast by ČT1 on Tuesday evening at 9:45 p.m.
Quite a large family can be modest.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva had to make do with an electric double stove and cramped conditions.
The house did not grow bigger, but Vašek made Eva happy by installing a gas stove to make preparing food for six people more comfortable.
When it&#39;s worst, we&#39;ll take turns taking a cab.
Eva is convinced that children perceive especially family well-being and a pleasant atmosphere, and not the size or shabbyness of the house.
So far we have put together very nicely, better than we expected.
The mess is harder to hide in a small space and we sometimes cross rolling babies, but at least we are all close by, smiles Eva, who can find a positive side in every situation.
Vašek&#39;s work as a film illuminator is not a guarantee of regular reception.
That&#39;s why he sometimes goes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his sixties, according to his words, he is physically able to take care of the finances of his family and children, but for how long?
&quot;I realize that due to our age difference, it will one day be me who will support this family,&quot; Eva admits plainly when asking about the future.
She would like to return to work, but she is even more attracted to the possibility of her own business.
With four children, I&#39;m not exactly for the employer.
And when it&#39;s worst, my husband and I can take turns taking a taxi, a nice blonde jokes.
Apple hit the yo-yo effect.
Displays are to blame.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a stronger chassis and a display that recognizes the power of touch, these are, in short, the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The last two also have a negative impact on the dimensions and weight of the 6s and 6s Plus iPhones.
Apple&#39;s trend so far has been that each new generation of the iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The only exceptions were the third and fourth generations, whose weight increased slightly compared to previous iPhones.
The difference in weight in terms of two grams to the detriment of the novelty was really negligible.
However, this is far from the case with the new iPhones.
Compared to last year&#39;s iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the weight of the smaller model increased by 14 grams, and the larger model by as much as 20 grams.
On the one hand, it is not surprising that last year&#39;s affair suffered greatly by bending in Apple&#39;s pockets.
The chassis of the novelty is thus made of a more durable aluminum alloy 7000, which was also reflected in the weight.
But displays have a much bigger impact on it.
Apple used 3D Touch technology in the news, thanks to which the displays recognize the power of touch.
To do this, it was necessary to provide the display with another layer of capacitive sensors.
The weight of the displays of the new iPhones has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For the smaller iPhone from originally 12 grams to 29 grams, in the case of the larger one from 19 to 40 grams.
With the iPhone 6s, the display is the heaviest component used.
Weighing just 143 grams, this novelty is also achieved thanks to the degreasing peel, which has touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, the battery is the heaviest element used, but its weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the largest increase is evident in the display.
The weight of the 5.5 &quot;iPhone 6s Plus thus reaches 192 grams.
The practicality of the new display technology will only become apparent during use.
The first users will be able to try it out on Friday, September 25, when the sale of 6s and 6s Plus iPhones will start in selected countries.
Have flakes been champions&#39; breakfasts for tens of thousands of years?
Archaeologists have succeeded in the Grotta Paglicci in Italy, which opens up interesting possibilities.
They discovered traces of settlement by modern man from various times, including murals, remnants of tools and so on and so forth.
However, in layer 23A, which according to instruments dates to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something very reminiscent of the remains of a breakfast buffet.
Traces of oat grains were found on the site, which apparently went through the process of making flakes so popular today.
Today, the grains are first soaked, then dried, stripped, so-called plowed, then steamed and pressed flat.
In the Paglicci cave, grains were found to have been heated or steamed, and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least according to the traces of use on the two stones in the cave.
Thus, the scientists were unable to prove in their publication for the PNAS magazine that the complete process of flake production was taking place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat flakes, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and quite possibly warm is, of course, quite logical.
At the same time, it is a very interesting proof of how intensively people used cereals long before agriculture began.
If the flake interpretation is correct, the oldest flakes have overtaken agriculture by about twenty thousand years.
New station reports in the Transport Company of the City of Brno.
So once again I listened to the announcement of the names of trolleybus stops: Hnusáčkova, Přízrak, Frázova, Spratecká.
Of course, the trolleybus was a little noisier, so the announcement by the male voice was a little less intelligible than before when the stops were announced by the female voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper noise of traffic it is better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
DPMB argues that this announcer was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don&#39;t know who, no one asked me, but they certainly chose it from studio recordings taken in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different than in the noise of a bus engine.
I have lived in Brno for quite a few decades, so I know the correct names of all those stops by heart, so I do not need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere who do not know Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended may be confused and may end up, where they had come by mistake, then to claim that the stop at which they were to disembark was not reported at all.
Maybe the choice of the announcer - but better again the announcer - should be made again, and this time tinged with the usual traffic noise and the roar of the engine, in which the whining of the speaker in the bus is almost lost.
So that we don&#39;t have to continue to listen to the names of the stations Vodní Heršpice, Šmírova, or then Ponorná in the creaking shale, which I transferred to in Komárov.
I guess my old man&#39;s hearing didn&#39;t suddenly deteriorate so much during the one day the announcer of the stops changed.
Before that day, I understood the reports quite well.
Good morning, Comrade Chief.
From the notes of the tracker.
Today, few people know what the so-called comprehensive inspections were the biggest and smartest parties under the government.
I allowed myself to remember it.
The bus was delayed.
I broke into the dispatcher&#39;s office the moment the radio said it was just seven o&#39;clock.
&quot;You&#39;re lucky you didn&#39;t collide with Comrade Chief, he came a minute before you, and he doesn&#39;t seem to be in the mood,&quot; the dispatcher remarked as I wrote in the Arrivals Book.
Thanks, I&#39;ll be careful.
Write me that I&#39;m going to the districts to revise the small mechanization.
It will not work, today there are inspections.
Everyone is fucking horrified.
What is it all about?
&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; the dispatcher grinned.
Next time you will too.
I ran down the hall.
Then the chief&#39;s door opened and the chief appeared.
Tight, with a stony face, in a perfectly fitting uniform.
&quot;Good morning, Chief,&quot; I said respectfully, quickly buttoning two buttons on my uniform jacket.
&quot;Good morning,&quot; came the reply, and I hurried to the second floor, not realizing the cold, sinister tone the old man had answered.
&quot;You&#39;re playing,&quot; said Engineer Eva, an elderly lady I valued very much.
She was even said to be the chief before her comrades deposed her.
There are checks and you will arrive tactically.
How many times have I asked what the complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it much.
They say they are once every three years, everyone has to go to them, and it&#39;s quite annoying.
At least for some.
However, I will see.
I pulled a folder with periodic reports and a phone out of the drawer.
&quot;This is Holcman, come to me now,&quot; came the chief&#39;s voice.
What&#39;s bothering me?
Now we met and nothing ... &quot;I muttered, but no one answered me, each with only his thoughts.
&quot;Hello, Comrade Chief, I have come at your command,&quot; I said, barely entering the chief&#39;s office.
The chief sat at his desk, looking at a file.
&quot;Comrade mechanic,&quot; he said after a moment, without raising his head and still examining the file carefully, &quot;I don&#39;t like your behavior at all.&quot;
He tossed the file on the table, leaned back in his chair, and stared at me with his usual, unpleasant, evil, prickly look.
I was unsure.
What&#39;s happening?
Just yesterday, the deputy praised himself that I had worked very well in those few months in office and that he was extremely satisfied with me.
That the chief did very well when he pulled me out of the platoon at a distance.
And now this?
Realize that you are a track distance technician and you have to act accordingly.
The greeting you used this morning is simply unacceptable.
I stammered that I had used such a greeting since childhood, that I had been brought up so much, and that I didn&#39;t see anything wrong with it.
To the chief, it was like a red turkey rag.
&quot;You are on the socialist railway, and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work,&quot; the chief chief said.
Plus, you&#39;re still confusing your superiors.
One time you say &quot;sir&quot; and the second time you say &quot;comrade&quot;.
But I am no chief to you, but a comrade chief.
Deputies are comrades deputies, top track masters are comrades top track masters!
Please remember that!
Excuse me, sir ... Comrade Chief, but ... but I greeted you with a normal civilian greeting.
There&#39;s nothing wrong with that ... and it&#39;s the honor of work or comrade ... you know ... I&#39;m not on the side ...
&quot;It&#39;s not your advantage not to be in the party,&quot; said the chief, who had calmed down a bit in the meantime.
However, this will still be discussed.
Anyway, remember you don&#39;t have a prepaid chair upstairs.
That wasn&#39;t good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it didn&#39;t look good to that person.
He stabbed me with a cold, prickly look for a moment, and I searched for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his elevated poking.
He was only a few years older and played God, actually Comrade God.
Jovial, cocky, authoritarian, arrogant, as it suited him at the moment.
Everyone shouted at him.
Come on, he&#39;s the chief.
In fact, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, touched him, like all party members, but also non-party members.
But the chief touched many, especially those in whom he could assert his superiority.
He wiped me for complete bullshit right now.
I thought something about fucking, and it cost me enough to not shoot him in the face.
But I wouldn&#39;t go back to the pickaxe, let alone work as a railroad clerk.
What would I feed two children from?
And a house under construction!
I was in trouble, but I controlled myself.
I won&#39;t make him happy.
&quot;That&#39;s all for now, you can go,&quot; the chief finished the audience, examining the file he had in his hand again.
They called me at half past ten.
Everyone in the office was already there, and when asked what and how, they said yes, that it would be good.
Only Jozin said bitingly, as was his custom, that they could not fire us all, because the comrade chief would have to do the work himself with his faithful, and that there was no danger.
He emphasized the word &quot;comrade&quot;, as if he knew what the old man had wiped me off in the morning.
There was a nice gathering in the chief&#39;s office.
Comrade Chief at his desk and at a long advisory table other comrades who were to decide on my official existence or non-existence.
Kádrovák, chairman of ROH, personnel recorder, special purpose officer, something like contempt in the war, and deputy, my boss.
And also the most important person, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the gravel.
An ordinary track worker, tamping sleepers or throwing gravel with pitchforks.
But also a former bachelor.
It was rumored that there was no fun with him at the time, supposedly a nice beast.
Evil tongues claimed that he came out of school in seventh grade, did not learn anything, did not know anything.
And when the crime was canceled, he ended up on the pickaxe.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief motioned me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, an unstoppable pine cone in my throat.
Kádrovák read the report from the civic committee from his place of residence.
I come from a working class family, I am married, have two children and so on and so forth.
So far so good, I thought, and I was already breathing a little better.
Then a testimonial from a street party organization.
He copied the report from the civic committee, perhaps both were written by the same person.
But then it came!
The parents of long-time members of the party refused to appear before the inspection commission and subsequently resigned from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
Kádrovák noticed this and stopped reading.
The chief motioned for him to continue.
It was only worse.
I was a member of the SSM city committee and there I was recruited as a party candidate.
Regardless of the parents who withdrew from the party, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and in addition to the national committee, I also had a wedding in church.
I disappointed the party&#39;s trust in the worst way.
That is why I was removed from the ranks of her candidates.
But it was not enough!
I had both children baptized, and even when my mother died, I gave a church funeral, even though she was a former party member.
With all this, I show a negative attitude towards the leading role of the party.
When the staff read, only tapping the chief&#39;s pencil on the tabletop broke the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
At the same time, I kept repeating in my mind &quot;Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans.&quot; What did I get myself into?
Why didn&#39;t I stay with the blacksmith?
I was able to repair the switches even without some damn inspection.
But now?
The career of the railroad clerk took over before it began.
Return to platoon?
That probably won&#39;t work, the chief will definitely leave me for an hour.
&quot;Comrade, how did you check on the comrade in question here?&quot; the chief broke the tense silence with a question on the staff.
Well, according to a review from a previous job.
Do you have it here?
Kádrovák was obviously not more than twice.
He was dripping nervously at the edges of his sweat, blinking nervously as if he had been being examined.
He nodded eagerly and handed the chief a piece of paper.
&quot;Well,&quot; said the chief, with a hint of joviality, which was often a harbinger of a storm.
At first glance, the praise itself, trained with honors, graduated in industrial engineering, worked as a locksmith on a task wage, and met the standard by an average of one hundred and twenty percent.
But the essential is missing.
Where did you get that testimonial, comrade? &quot;He turned again to the cadre, who felt that it was somehow beginning to turn against him, and that very soon he might not even be a cadre.
This is where the comrade gave it to me on boarding.
Is that enough for you?
&quot;Well, when he joined us, he went to the platoon of the platoon,&quot; the staff squealed.
And there are no testimonials required, his was somehow extra, so I put it in his folder.
&quot;So this piece of paper was enough for you to be included in the technical function,&quot; the chief stated dryly.
Kádrovák blinked nervously and had no answer.
&quot;Never mind, we&#39;ll discuss that later,&quot; the chief concluded, and the staff was obviously relieved.
For now, it has stopped.
&quot;So what about you, comrade?&quot; the chief turned to me again.
Suddenly he yells at me, so it&#39;s over!
My eyes darkened, I was hot.
There was a flurry of remorse and accusation, and I knew I was the most disgusting creature in the world that did not deserve the slightest mercy.
That by pushing the incomplete report I misled my comrade cadre clerk, I did not understand why the report was incomplete when I got it from the staff in the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element which, at the time of the building of real socialism, supports the ranks of religious darkness, and even participates in them.
That, yes, there was a lot I had done, or maybe I would do, and I prayed quietly for it to end.
I didn&#39;t care.
I didn&#39;t care if I flew out of the mechanic&#39;s seat.
I didn&#39;t care if they took the pickaxe from me.
This is a job for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of Comrade Chief.
&quot;That would be enough, Comrade Chief,&quot; the party chairman said suddenly, severely interrupting the chief&#39;s levity.
This is where the comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he was stupid!
But he has already received his punishment!
Don&#39;t forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young person than closing his side door for a while!
In order to open up to him again, he will have to prove that he has changed, that he is worthy of our trust again.
An uneducated bachelor spoke like a book.
Where did it come from?
Is it so literate or parroted phrases from party trainings and meetings?
That is why this young comrade must also get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he&#39;s changed.
And who is to give it to him, if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat mistaken comrade, in his efforts to redress!
It is your party duty that no one will relieve you of!
In fact, it is a party duty for all of us as well.
Here the comrade must see that the party has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother she not only punishes, but that she also loves.
When the chairman finished, no one even said.
Nobody expected such a turnaround.
At least me.
&quot;I completely agree with you, Comrade President,&quot; the chief said coldly, trying to take the initiative again.
If you let me finish, you would hear that I was heading for such a conclusion.
Everyone nodded in agreement, but they could tell they didn&#39;t believe a word he said.
&quot;So I was confirmed as an independent fund manager,&quot; I shouted as I returned to the office, and then cried.
Besides engineer Eva, everyone was at lunch.
She listened in silence to my incoherent account of fresh experiences, and in the meantime I calmed down.
When I finished, she asked if I would like a coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she set the water on the stove and prepared the cups.
In the meantime, she talked about staffing practices.
As one testimonial, often full of praise, they give to a person, and the other, in which there is some dirt, is sent to a new employer.
But I didn&#39;t end up where I should have been, but on the pickaxe, so the comrades from the factory didn&#39;t know where to send it.
And our staff?
He just cares where he would eat or drink, and so in the end it turned out as it turned out.
&quot;He catches it from the old man,&quot; she remarked maliciously.
He certainly won&#39;t like it today.
Watch out for him anyway, he&#39;s quite vindictive.
And the party chairman?
Basically a far worse chief, no philanthropist.
Zero from a pickaxe having great power.
The water for the coffee began to boil, and then the office filled with the smell of just coffee.
I tossed a sugar cube into the cup and silently mixed the hot potion.
Maybe I&#39;m out of the worst.
He won&#39;t fire me now and the next checks are in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief just won&#39;t forget me today.

The symbol of the village came to life.
The wheel of the pinwheel above Chlum is spinning again after years.
It can be seen from afar, because it is located on a fifteen meter high mast.
People from a wide area call him a &quot;fan on Chlum&quot;.
For a municipality with 150 inhabitants, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem that the municipality acquired on the occasion of the meeting of the natives in 2010.
&quot;We applied for the emblem at the time and of course we wanted to have a fan on the emblem, everyone around it knows it,&quot; stated the mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum wind pump is a local technical monument.
It is also a bit of a memento of the present: it is reminiscent of a time when the local people fought for quality drinking water.
The one in Chlum in the past centuries was a rarity.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlum representatives decided on a solution, which then suited until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the turnoff to Číchov, they had a seven-meter-deep well dug.
Three years later, the well was supplemented by a metal structure with a wind pump, which pumped water into a reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
&quot;The construction was carried out by the company Antonín Kunc from Hranice na Moravě at a cost of 2,400 crowns,&quot; says a commemorative inscription on the ground floor of the mast structure.
After several repairs and falls of the wind wheel, the pump reached the end of its service life in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the struggle for water began to be written: on that day, a new water supply system began to serve in Chlum.
The wind pump remained only a non-functional municipal symbol and a local rarity.
They dominated the dominant at this year&#39;s meeting of natives.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlum family decided to repair the windmill again and start it up again.
They had a replica of the original wheel made - reduced by half a meter in diameter.
The bike was mounted on a mast, but the same year it had to be lowered.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose a suitable material and the bike could not withstand the gusts of wind.
Then the Chlum landmark rested under the roof for several years.
From June this year, however, the wheel on the high mast is spinning again.
On the occasion of the meeting of the natives, the village had a replica of the bicycle modified and re-installed it on top of the iron tower.
But the wheel draws service water from the well only to the overflow blind arm.
And during the summer we completely disconnected it because there was little water in the well.
At least it was spinning empty.
&quot;In the autumn, we will disconnect the wind wheel shaft from the pump in the suction basket again,&quot; Mayor Mašek explained.
Chlum is not the only village in the Czech Republic where a windmill has entered the municipal emblem, but it is the only village of its kind in the entire Vysočina region.
They have a similar element in the emblem in honor of local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovice and Zelená Hora in the Vyškov region, in Kuželov in the Hodonín region, in Partutovice in the Přerov region or in Police in the Vsetín region.
There is nothing wrong with that, but I do not know Lafata, the support of Tripoli admitted Goian.
&quot;I remember the match against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone in my career,&quot; Goian, 34, smiled at a pre-match press conference.
We were coached by Georgh Hagi at the time, it was unfortunate that we lost.
I hope to score a goal for Sparta now.
The only difference is that we won&#39;t lose this time, &quot;Goian continued.
This man, who played 60 matches for the Romanian national team, is the key support of the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the onslaught of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, says the Spartan Hybs about the Greek duel.
And he partially knows what might await him on Thursday night.
I know Fatai well, who played in Astra, Romania with my brother Lucian.
At that time, I saw all their matches.
I know he&#39;s a very good striker, so he went to Sparta too, Goian said.
He did not name other footballers from the Prague club, so the direct question arose as to whether he also knew David Lafata, the best scorer in the history of the Czech league and Captain Sparta.
Goian smiled and aimed at the Czech journalists with a slightly reproachful look.
A clueless look on his face said, &quot;Why are you asking me that?&quot;
After a moment of silence, he let go.
We saw some videos and I noticed that Sparta plays a lot in a team.
He has really good players.
And Lafata?
Nothing wrong, but I don&#39;t know anyone but Fatai.
The Spartans know this very well about Goian.
&quot;He has experience from larger clubs, it can be said that he holds the defense of Asteras, he is their organizer of the game,&quot; observed the Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Although Goian has had his best years, he can boast a very interesting football CV.
Borussia Dortmund and Stuttgart were interested in him at the time, but both the Manchester and United teams from Manchester, but from Steauy he headed to Palermo, Italy, and also played for the Glasgow Rangers.
We are expecting an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, it regularly plays European cups, it competes for victory in the Czech league.
For me, he is a favorite in this match, but we play at home and we want to start the group with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I am in a room with the Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is very much looking forward to the opponent from the Czech Republic.
I also.
But for the whole team, I can say that we will fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague Stock Exchange.
Kofola should have a new headquarters in Ostrava.
Kofola SA was registered in Poland due to trading in the company&#39;s shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary goal is to have the group&#39;s headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are mostly legal and administrative and do not have a real impact on what is happening in the company, says Daniel Buryš, CFO of the Kofola Group.
&quot;In connection with the transfer of the group&#39;s registered office, the shareholders are considering placing the shares on the Prague Stock Exchange.&quot;
Due to its admission to the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalizing a securities prospectus, which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding company&#39;s registered office and the related transfers of shares will take place in the form of a non-public transaction, with only the existing shareholders participating in it.
Therefore, no shares will be offered to the public or new investors as part of this operation.
&quot;A possible offer of shares to new investors would take place - if the company and its shareholders so decide - later, either in the 4th quarter of 2015 or in the 1st quarter of 2016,&quot; the company said.
The company has stated in the past that a possible offer of shares could consist of the issue of new shares or the sale of existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchange in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Czech Television&#39;s objectivity test in informing about the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the coverage of the main Czech media about the refugee crisis.
This time broadcasting the main news program of Czech Television.
And how did she survive?
When they teach at the Faculty of Journalism about how the media can manipulate reality, they can start today&#39;s broadcasting of Czech Television Events.
About 80% of news coverage was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Except for the first minute, when the Czech Television informed about the riots on the Serbian-Hungarian border and called the migrants&#39; attacks on police officers euphemistically, they ran out of patience - they threw stones and attacked with metal sticks).
Criticism of NGOs - Great space for non-profit organizations that criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech school - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees not only as a threat, but also as a chance.
Wandering of refugees - ČT consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee and not migrant.
What is striking is the fact that CT consistently uses only shots of young children and women in illustrative shots.
At the same time, she stated in the same broadcast that 80% of migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda unparalleled from communist agitators.
I must say that, as a former journalist, I am ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
When I once flocked to a block of flats, I soon ceased to be the only inhabitant.
My fish moved into the Umakarta toilet.
Domestic fish, an insect with an imperfect transformation, ie, not undergoing that transformation from a caterpillar to a beetle and a young, looks like an adult, only it is tiny and gradually grows.
They were disgusting to me and I didn&#39;t hesitate to kill them.
First manually and later chemically.
The Socialist drugstore provided a kind of blue crystals for their liquidation.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or something else?
However, it eliminated them successfully.
Later I dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with a kind of juvenalizer, which the ants brought to the nest, and he then did not allow the queen to generate new offspring.
But I turned it down.
As time went on, insects became the object of my admiration, and I became more and more inclined to believe that they had the same right to life as we humans.
In addition, I have learned from life that interfering with the ecosystem does not lead to success and that one pest can replace another.
True to fleas and bedbugs, I probably wouldn&#39;t bother to worsen my karma by killing them.
In my new residence, my partner and I agreed that if the fish were not crawling up our necks, they would eat flakes of fallen skin, some invisible algae and the like in peace.
Over time, their peaceful existence was disrupted by a spider.
It was a common kind of intruder who lived on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought he lived on occasional flies and mosquitoes, which only increased our comfort.
Because he lived with us for several years, we found out that he feeds mainly on fish and that their number was probably kept at a tolerable number.
Through confidential regular contact with each performed need, we found out that she is a female.
We have witnessed romantic courtships with a partner about a third smaller, as he carefully strums the cobwebs so that he is not eaten before he reaches the desired copulation.
It took about three days, when they did not move and did not respond to our inspections.
Under the toilet bowl, where the love games took place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
Then the spider didn&#39;t even move for weeks.
When we thought she was done, we were surprised by the number of little spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
They were partly eaten by their mother, partly scattered elsewhere.
Even the female disappeared somewhere after a week.
We don&#39;t know if she went elsewhere or died, but after a month or two, she reappeared on the ceiling.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of the ancestor of the toilet.
For a while, she watched our behavior cautiously from the ceiling, and by moving under the toilet bowl, she assessed our non-attack as a friendship.
The number of somewhat multiplied fishes decreased again, and the spider watched its normal activities to provide food in peace.
Our ecosystem has not changed throughout the year.
In the meantime, our daughter has reached an age when using the potty was a disgrace.
So far we have tolerated it, but the eternal outpouring of its contents has already taken hold of us.
We encouraged her to use the toilet more and more strongly.
However, the daughter found an excuse to keep her habit in the spider, which she could see very well when wiping.
Our talk about seeing a spider not having luck in the house didn&#39;t take away at all.
She forced her potty by crying and roaring.
There was no leftover.
There came a time when the spider had to command himself in order to move his daughter&#39;s development.
It&#39;s up to me.
He was caught in a glass and sent across the balcony to a garden.
I said goodbye to him as a friend, but I still felt disgusted after throwing up for so long, as if I were throwing out a relative.
We assumed that the fish began to appear more often and began to multiply geometrically.
Wonder of the world, a week or two, none of us appeared there.
I began to speculate about the cause.
I wondered if the ant-spider had somehow cultivated them there, that the toilet environment wasn&#39;t as conducive to their existence as we thought.
But then the first bits of medium size appeared, and they were crowded again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their extinction, and I realized that their attachment to the spider must have been caused by the fact that when they didn&#39;t see it, that it was hidden somewhere else, and that they were in danger from anywhere.
Or, maybe they had some telepathic connection to their predator, and his rapid disappearance provoked an alarm in them.
All the more so because I have no illusions about their eyesight.
They showed some light shyness, but they didn&#39;t respond to waving or quick movements.
The daughter already goes to the toilet regularly.
I think she forgot about the potty.
All that remains is to attract some spider again.
I&#39;m already airing my wishes on the air and I hope they didn&#39;t betray me after that execution.
Otherwise we would have to use Cyclone B.
Ten statements by Albert Einstein that enriched the world.
The statements of a genius scientist from the last century will probably never cease to fascinate humanity.
He was able to dive so deep into everything that the product was always an astonishing discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He came to the attention of humans mainly by his special and general theory of relativity, which so far best describes the universe in its gigantic relationship.
It is also important to clarify its photo effect or the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field.
There is no doubt that the very description and system of knowledge of the popular theory of relativity is so complex for many that they prefer to choose easy examples for a closer acquaintance.
However, it is not easy.
But it would not be Albert Einstein if he did not find an ingeniously simplified form of explanation for this as well: A watch near your loved one seems like a minute; A minute in a hot oven seems like an hour - and that&#39;s relativity.
I allowed myself to choose these ten from his whole constellation of famous quotes, which literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, brilliant people try not to do them.
Only two things are endless.
The universe and human stupidity.
I&#39;m not so sure about the first one.
No number of attempts can ever prove that I was right.
However, only one can prove that I was wrong at any time.
But it is a sad time when it is easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudices.
If the clutter on the table is a reflection of the clutter in the mind, then what reflects the empty table?
I don&#39;t know what he will fight in World War III, but in the fourth it will be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but none to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing a lot too.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem on which my life would depend, I would spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand income tax.
In conclusion, I cannot forgive myself for not mentioning Einstein&#39;s formula on the definition of success: If we take A for success, the formula holds: A = X + Y + Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is to hold the tongue.
New and modern.
Hospitals in the Zlín Region are expecting changes worth 1.5 billion.
&quot;It is a success, considering that all four have been in the black this year,&quot; said Stanislav Mišák, Governor Stanislav, with satisfaction.
The total profit of regional facilities is currently about 32 million crowns.
This is mainly due to higher reimbursements from insurance companies, which are just as favorable for this year.
This fact also shows that, after poor years, hospitals can finally afford more investment.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherské Hradiště and Zlín, thanks to this, constructions are preparing, which together will cost almost 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period when we mainly bought devices is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them it is not possible to do top healthcare, explained the regional deputy for healthcare Lubomír Nečas.
He is looking forward to changes in all hospitals.
Builders will come to the hospitals next year.
In Vsetín, they are now choosing the suppliers of a new internal pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
In Kroměříž they have a dialysis extension planned.
Uherské Hradiště wants to add a new interior for about 200 million to the central pavilion opened this year.
And the long-delayed construction of a new central reception and internal medicine center awaits Zlín&#39;s Baťa Hospital, which will require three-quarters of a billion.
In all cases, these are fundamental and often the biggest changes in recent years.
&quot;This is an extremely important step for the entire region, patients and doctors,&quot; said Věra Prousková, the hospital&#39;s director, about the construction of the Vsetín internship.
The five-storey building is to be completed there in about two years and will offer comfortable equipment for internal medicine and neurology, dialysis, new ambulances, beds and an intensive care unit.
Greater comfort for patients.
Changes that are particularly noticeable to patients will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those in which, for example, many patients lie in one room, they have only one toilet on the floor, the beds are non-adjustable, the windows are leaking and the paramedics do not have adequate working conditions.
&quot;For example, our internship was built thirty-five years ago and is now on the verge of its life,&quot; pointed out the director of the Zlín Hospital Pavel Calábek.
Within a few years, it will therefore be replaced by a seven-storey modern building connected with an urgent reception.
Physicians and patients will thus have all acute wards in one place, in addition to new premises.
Half of the same model has already been completed in Uherské Hradiště.
The central income is already worth it and the internal medicine will be added to it within three years.
&quot;We will pay for the construction from the loan and partly from our own resources,&quot; explained director Petr Sládek.
This hospital is the only one in the region that can afford its own financing.
The profit is still the highest and it did not make a loss even two years ago, when, for example, the Zlín hospital was struggling with a loss of almost two hundred million.
&quot;We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, we increase revenues and we effectively manage costs throughout the hospital,&quot; said Vlastimil Vajdák, who is in charge of the economy.
Patients from the Kroměříž hospital will also see improvements.
Within ten to fifteen years, up to half a billion crowns will go to repairs, new devices and reconstructions.
The repair station will be repaired this year, then the dialysis extension will begin, or the construction of a building for a new magnetic resonance imaging.

No one explained to me how I should keep the received refugees in the country if they do not want to live in the Czech Republic.
After talks with his European colleagues, Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (CSSD) complains that other Czech states are pushing the Czechia to accept quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they reject any discussion.
He also notes that no one has yet explained to him how to keep assigned refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us anyway.
&quot;We did not receive an answer, which is why we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text,&quot; Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you took at the meeting of the Ministers of the Interior and Foreign Affairs of the European Union?
We do not agree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We cannot talk about migrants as bags of salt or flour.
They are living beings who have some visions, they are going somewhere, they have some relatives.
We wanted to hear from colleagues how we would be able to keep migrants on the territory of the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can&#39;t imagine it.
We did not receive an answer, so we wanted the quotas to be deleted from the final text.
With other conclusions - functional hotspots, ie registration points, border protection, camps outside Europe, a trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We have been talking about this for a year and we say that this is the way to go.
But to say that quotas will solve everything?
We recently dealt with forty thousand, now it&#39;s one hundred and twenty thousand.
When will it be five hundred thousand?
And how do we keep those people in that territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who cross us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants us, we just don&#39;t know how to keep them here.
Other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their destination country, have asylum in our country with the ambition to come to us, but the interest of people from this wave of migration, ie from Syria and other countries, is close to zero.
You mentioned that refugees don&#39;t even want to come to us, but we have already committed to accepting fifteen hundred people.
Would it not be possible to accept more of them this way?
We are committed to accepting 1,500 people, but on condition.
We said: functional hotspots, border protection, military operation.
Even with the 1,500, the point is that 1,100 people will come with whom we will handle the asylum procedure.
They will come to our detention facility and we will treat them the same as those we captured.
It is a big question, and we will be debating with Europe about whether we can detain people who will be registered in Italy and Greece, or in Hungary.
Because Europe is behaving in such a way that if they are registered, they cannot be detained.
That is, they will come to our territory with registration, and if there is an agreement that is not yet, it may happen that we will not keep even the 1100 in the territory of the Czech Republic and they will leave for Germany again upon arrival.
If we are able to detain them during the asylum procedure, we will arrange an asylum procedure with them.
According to European statistics, almost 98 percent of the citizens of Syria, Eritrea, receive international protection.
Then they will receive documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there are the four hundred people who will relocate.
This is the second project to be launched, and we have made progress there only in debating with the churches about the possibility that they could help them find employment, accommodation, and so on.
But it&#39;s a very long run.
You said that the other states were not willing to discuss with us at the ministerial meeting.
But is it not the case that the Czech Republic is only rejecting quotas, but is not offering any solidarity step that would unblock the debate?
And what exactly do you think this is a solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany utters the incentive that all migrants from Syria can come to them, then the news is spread within hours in all camps in Europe, but also in Turkey and Jordan.
It encourages another wave of migration to Germany, because they simply do not want to come to us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders - simply to discourage those waves of migration, help those in need, and separate economic migrants.
Make it clear to them that they have no chance.
Last year alone, 50,000 Kosovars came to Germany.
From a secure Kosovo, where we pay all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor&#39;s office.
If we succeed in separating them and not accepting them, or accepting them only according to the needs of the economies, then the fifty percent of what social systems spend on them in vain today could go to refugees.
Compared to the first day when Germany introduced controls, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
It&#39;s eighty now, the first day it was twelve.
How far should it go to make border controls even stricter?
We were afraid of being caught by hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacancies in stone detention facilities.
Of course, we will return all the people we detain to Austria within seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people from us, it&#39;s difficult with Hungary and the Greeks - it&#39;s a completely useless story.
So where is the breaking point?
Would it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it would have to be several hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day, two or three consecutive days, will deplete our capacity so much that crisis plans will emerge.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister that he would immediately convene an extraordinary government.
He is very interested in the whole thing, we are in telephone contact several times a day.
If that situation arose, the government could sit de facto immediately, and in one resolution it would decide to strengthen the police with the army, say the customs administration, or the prison service.
The last resort is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don&#39;t think it can get this far.
Realize that our position is different, we are a national state within Europe, we only have the Schengen border at the airport.
I don&#39;t know what would have to happen for this to happen in the Czech Republic, I don&#39;t want to spread alarm information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia or Hungary, suggests that the Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost never.
Slavia repaid much of its debt at the last minute.
It tries to prevent bankruptcy.
Football Slavia paid the debts.
Footballers also received their money.
Football Slavia stood in court for the first time on Tuesday due to insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after Online Services from Pacific Samoa submitted a proposal for it due to roughly 20 million crowns.
Slavia&#39;s lawyer Zuzana Mládková tried to convince Judge Michaela Wenzlová within a few hours that she should not declare bankruptcy over Slavia.
And it must be said that she had arguments.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimáně became the new owner of Slavia.
Apparently the money arrived at the club from the new owners, at the last minute.
This is also proved by Slavia&#39;s statement before Tuesday&#39;s court hearing - on Monday, the Vršovice club sent tens of millions of crowns owed on Monday, just the day before the court hearing.
&quot;Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15,&quot; said lawyer Slavia Mládková.
Who did Slavia pay?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, for example, the Slovak ex-representative Milan Ivan or the Czech midfielder Maria Liček.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenicki.
Already on Friday, the club also paid the due fees of the Prague 10 district.
In fact, only receivables that Slavia disputes remain part of the insolvency dispute.
According to the club, either the obligations did not arise at all or there are legal disputes about them.
However, we are prepared to pay the amounts if these disputes are lost.
&quot;We have the necessary funds in a bank account, which we can prove with an account statement,&quot; lawyer Mládková told the judge.
&quot;Everything that was overdue is paid,&quot; Mládková said, adding that only outstanding or disputed liabilities are unpaid.
It is also certain that in the coming days the judge will not decide and the proceedings will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she had actually paid the debts.
Subsequently, all evidence will be evaluated.
The decision can therefore be expected in November at the earliest.
The judge ordered the hearing to continue on the third of November.
However, the decision will not be made at this meeting, but only in writing after it.

Blanka could be built so that it would not collapse.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert from the company that designed the tunnel.
Blanka could be minted even safer, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex could be built so that there would not be two soil dips in Stromovka, Prague, says Alexandr Butovič, the production director of Satra, which is the main designer of the tunnel.
He said this on Wednesday evening during a press tour of the tunnel.
But according to him, it would be about half a billion crowns more expensive.
It will be open to drivers on Saturday afternoons.
It is always a compromise between price and safety.
&quot;The tunnel was safer to build, but the costs are growing exponentially,&quot; said Butovic.
According to him, the conditions in Stromovka were the same all the time, yet the land collapsed just a few steps from where it began to be excavated with a safer and more careful method.
&quot;If the measures had been applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would have been half a billion more expensive,&quot; Butovic said.
The Blanka tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was formed in Stromovka, in 2010 the land fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostav director Jiří Bělohlav, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, he told the weekly Euro.
According to the original plan, the construction was to cost 17 billion crowns.
If we add the VAT, which jumped twice during the construction period, you have twenty-one billion from seventeen billion.
Add to that technology, land purchases and engineering, valorisation and similar items, it&#39;s 29 billion, which is not that far from the 37, said Belohlav.
Someone ordered that and paid for it.

FedEx profits mixed, lowering the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results for the last quarter and a huge drop in full-year earnings forecasts due to low freight demand and higher ground division costs.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
During this period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company&#39;s shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday&#39;s opening.
FedEx says it expects earnings of between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $ 10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite an average interest rate increase of 4.9 percent, which will be reflected in January. 4, and higher surcharges for land transportation of heavy or large packages starting in November.
The company said it still expects profit growth compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, chairman and chief executive officer, said Fred Smith said the company was &quot;performing well despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade.&quot;
Holiday hiring plans were announced the day after rival UPS said it planned to hire an extra 90,000 to 95,000 workers, about the same as they hired last year.
In the quarter that ended in August. 31, FedEx raised $ 692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share were $ 2.42, which is less than $ 2.44 per share, as predicted by 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $ 12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in priority international shipping in recent years, causing revenue in its Express Unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted FedEx&#39;s ground unit results.
Ground revenues rose 29 percent in the last quarter, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher base rates, while profit fell in freight trade due to higher labor prices.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx&#39;s shares fell $ 3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $ 150.15.
They ended Tuesday with a drop of 11 percent a year and 17 percent below the record of June 11.
At its most anticipated meeting in years, federal reserve lawmakers will spend two days sitting at a 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table this week, deciding whether it&#39;s almost ten years after raising the key interest rate.
Towering over them at one end of the central bank&#39;s ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues are to put the nation&#39;s economic interests above all else.
The central bank has a double charge from Congress: maximizing US employment and keeping prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be an X-factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the US economy is ready to start weaning from an unprecedented stimulus of near-zero short-term interest rates in place since end of 2008.
Although most data show solid economic growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed from adding to volatility by raising its federal funds reference rate - by no more than a quarter of a percentage point.
&quot;Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch first,&quot; said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co.
&quot;But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already provides them with sufficient justification to wait further,&quot; she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is a source of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with a key indicator of only about 30% chance of an increase.
This would point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates only if politicians soften the slump with the promise that a further increase is in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The rally was triggered by expectations that Fed politicians would keep rates calm this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody&#39;s Capital Markets Research Group.
&quot;It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now,&quot; he said.
If the Fed&#39;s politicians did that, &quot;they would have to go to extremes in their program statement and hold the financial markets in their hands so as not to panic.&quot;
Other experts argued that raising rates would calm financial markets by removing uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on track to raise rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in slowly tightening monetary conditions to confirm the strength of the US economic recovery.
Yellen said she expected rates to rise this year this spring and early summer, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labor market has seen solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and is close to what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage gains showed signs of rising.
And while inflation remains below the central bank&#39;s 2% annual target, Fed politicians say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy &quot;can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tightness of the labor market,&quot; said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to falter late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as high as 16% below its record high in May as investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would pull global growth down.
The market rebounded somewhat this month and the Dow is now losing only almost 10% of its May high.
The troubled market situation provides Fed officials with a comprehensive calculation of when to start raising interest rates.
&quot;In the absence of what has happened in the financial markets, and reports of the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, this meeting would be tightened,&quot; said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former official. Fed.
He now predicts that they will wait at least a month to gain better control over the consequences.
&quot;There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the US economy, and they have almost no data to rely on the latest developments in China,&quot; Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed&#39;s main concerns, so technically it should not be included in their decisions.
But in fact, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the whole world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could &quot;narrow&quot; their monetary expansion in the market sparked convulsions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but they also consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is &quot;more art than science,&quot; said Zachary Karabell, head of global wealth management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve in Richmond, Va., Remarked this month that &quot;the Fed has a history of exaggerating movements in financial markets that seem incoherent with economic fundamentals.&quot;
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee&#39;s policy-making who pushed for rate hikes, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its reference rate by 0.75 percentage points during three sessions &quot;Despite the limited identifiable impact on US growth,&quot; Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed the cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize financial stability concerns during a major crisis, such as the market crash of 2008, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England&#39;s rating committee.
The latest turmoil is not even approaching this level, he said.
&quot;You certainly don&#39;t want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because markets have been upset,&quot; said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don&#39;t think they should be at the forefront.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it&#39;s Chinatown, not Thai Quarter.
The market / warehouse is the only point of contact that offers a stunning array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.

The store is massive and it will take you over an hour to crawl all the alleys.
If you&#39;re hungry for all this shopping, enjoy a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trade stand (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various collection points.
What&#39;s in stock: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
You&#39;ll probably find it in LAX-C.
Items are affordable and lots of items are sold in bulk.

The speed on the highways will remain the same.
The House rejected the acceleration to 150 km / h.
On selected sections of motorways, it will not be possible to increase the maximum permitted speed to 150 km / h under favorable conditions.
The Chamber of Deputies decided on Tuesday when it agreed to the Senate&#39;s amendment, which rejected the increase in speed.
The amendment to the Roads Act will now head to the President.
Already at the end of April, President Miloš Zeman said that he would veto a law allowing a 150-kilometer speed.
The Minister of Transport Dan Ťok (for YES) was also against the increase, according to which the Czech motorway network has not yet been built at such a speed.
On Tuesday, deputies in front of deputies supported the Senate version of the law.
The approved amendment will now allow, in accordance with the original government&#39;s proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 kilometers per hour on selected first-class roads, especially four-lane roads.
The Chamber of Deputies first extended this possibility to motorways, on which it would be possible to drive in selected sections at speeds of up to 150 km / h, but the Senate refused.
MEPs have now agreed to his proposal.
With the consent of the Minister of Transport, the senators also removed from the amendment the authorization of the traffic police to have the final say in the regulation of local roads, which are taken care of by municipalities.
The Senate version, which was approved by the Chamber of Deputies, also envisages that sewers, water mains or public lighting cables can be laid longitudinally below the road surface.
Municipalities would thus save on the purchase of land.
Municipalities should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
The amendment is also intended to help improve road protection and make it easier for municipalities to dispose of towed vehicles to which the owners do not report.
Newly, municipalities could sell towed vehicles, which will not be registered by their owners within six months of being notified of the towing.
Municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight traffic through their territory on second and third class roads under the threat of a fine for forwarding companies.
The amendment also removes the possibility of introducing electronic motorway stamps instead of the existing paper ones, which will be used after 1 January next year.
According to the government, this will save money on the introduction of an electronic system.
The Ústí nad Labem expressor goes to court.
He faces 10 years for overpriced welcoming citizens.
The case concerns an allegedly overpriced project Welcoming Citizens.
The police also wanted to prosecute MP Zuzana Kailová (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her.
Depending on the legal qualification of the case, both face up to ten years in prison.
The main trial is currently scheduled for two October days.
According to public prosecutor Mandík and Macík, they caused damage of at least one million crowns, according to the indictment.
The applicant relies on an expert opinion.
According to the plaintiff, the former members of the city management, by virtue of their position, unjustifiably made it possible to obtain the property benefit of the company that organized the welcome of citizens.
According to the indictment, Mandík ordered the then head of the municipal department of municipal services, education and culture to address five connected companies in a tender.
When another company, which offered the lowest price, entered the competition, the town hall canceled the competition.
The city was then to be entrusted by the city to the administrator, and only Darothore entered the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid out at least an extra million.
Both accusers, led by the aim of securing for Darothore the award of a public contract for the organization of the Welcoming of Citizens event in Ústí nad Labem, acted in a long-term and coordinated manner at least in conflict with the requirement to proceed with due diligence, writes the public prosecutor.
At the same time, according to him, they were aware that Darothore, after obtaining this contract, will charge Ústí nad Labem a price for the implementation of the Citizens&#39; Welcome event, which will be disproportionately increased compared to the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, according to the file, the company collected more than five million crowns for the project.
In the end, the city paid out only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew from the contract.
According to the expert opinion, the amount paid out was overpriced by at least one million crowns.
Mandík had previously rejected any violation of the law.
I have not committed any crime, I am innocent.
I do not understand this contrived case, the former mayor said earlier, adding that the city under his leadership only followed up on a similar project from previous years.
From 2008 to 2010, the event was organized by the Roxy II agency.
&quot;It was under the same conditions, for the same money,&quot; Mandík added.
Criminalists originally wanted to accuse MP Kaila, who was also a member of the city council.
However, the Chamber of Deputies did not extradite her to prosecute.
Criminalists have therefore postponed the case in her case, but expect to accuse Kaila after her parliamentary term ends.
Welcoming the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Mothers received a gift voucher for 5 thousand crowns to buy children&#39;s supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police allegedly released a refugee dog.
Then they forced the journalists to delete the record.
Hungarian police allegedly briefly detained an AP cameraman on the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a record in which a police dog allegedly knocked a refugee to the ground.
However, the Hungarian government questions this accusation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants who crossed the border with Serbia across a cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
The police intervened against the refugees and one of them had a dog with a basket on his nose attacked a Syrian.
The dog of the man who shouted &quot;Please, please, I&#39;m a refugee,&quot; he said, says Muzi.
One of the policemen noticed that Muzi was filming everything and did not allow him to leave.
The journalist was then no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
Police took Muzi to a dark spot at the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had recorded.
Then he was ordered to delete the record.
Muzi thus lost the result of two days of work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs nearby.
The AP sent a protest letter to the spokesman of the Hungarian government, Zoltán Kovács.
She described police officers&#39; behavior as unacceptable and said journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and not have to worry about the government destroying legally obtained material.
Kovács, referring to the police report, questioned Muzi&#39;s account of the events.
He said that the police only wanted the journalist to show them if they were on certain shots, to which they are said to be entitled.
When they found out that they were not there, they did not force him to delete anything.
&quot;Dogs can bark - they are trained to scare and scare a little, but they have not attacked with certainty,&quot; says Kovács.
The Unpredictable Champions League.
Winning the City will kick us, believes Juventus
&quot;It&#39;s a disappointment, I don&#39;t think we deserved to lose,&quot; Manuel Pellegrini, a coach at Home City, shook his head.
We had more chances and played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League match.
Neither team created many opportunities, but we had the ball on our feet longer.
&quot;The cause of the defeat was not in tactics, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals,&quot; said Pellegrini, whose team collected in a competitive match after a long 636 minutes.
Last year&#39;s finalist Juventus was exactly the opposite before the match - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he has only a point as the defending champion and with a score of 2: 4 he is only in 16th place in the table.
That&#39;s why the turn to Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
&quot;This win will help us mentally, it will kick us,&quot; believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three supports - Pirla, Tévez and Vidal - before the new year.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manchukich and Morata.
&quot;That&#39;s right, this victory is very important, maybe thanks to him we will ride the winning wave,&quot; Morata hopes.
Because when we are on it, we are among the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the offensive phase.
My players deserve this result.
&quot;Before our equalizing goal, on the other hand, we could have collected 0: 2, but Gianluigi held us back,&quot; praised Buffero&#39;s Allegri coach.
&quot;We burned some good chances,&quot; regretted Yayu Touré, City midfielder.
We have to take experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye Angelo, goodbye old Germany II.
Before we continue on the issue of immigrants, we should realize that all this media crackdown is controlled by professionals.
According to the needs of the media and also from above.
So let&#39;s stop for a moment.
Today, newspapers and the media are full of children carrying their parents on the dusty paths of the exodus.
And this automatically evokes a feeling of guilt and compassion in man - that is, in European man.
Well, it&#39;s not just desperate children coming here, notice in the shots of the boats landing on the Greek islands that the children are not so visible on them!
And somehow, recently, pictures of ships heading for Lampedusa, refugees in front of the French border near Menton, where thousands of young men lie down, have disappeared from television.
For the most part, young blacks.
And the pictures from Callais, where they were eating and the black men waiting to see if they could climb the tunnel under the English Channel, had disappeared.
He probably doesn&#39;t touch it anymore.
Even the pictures of the primitive Christian church of the Eritreans somehow did not make a special impression on the people of Europe.
Falseness was too much of it.
So when it comes to quotas for refugees, it is somehow hidden that they are not only unhappy children from Syria, but also sophisticated - for the elderly: fashionably fancy - young men.
Their musculatures look as if they have just climbed out of a fitness center.
Only one personal experience.
This summer in the Turkish - Muslim - part of Cyprus we were lying on the private beach of the hotel.
Despite being private, a large group of cars suddenly came to the beach.
But no ham.
And young blacks came out.
About thirty men and five women.
Age between 15 and 30 years.
They entered the beach, all dressed in designer clothes and shoes. In the hands of, as usual, smartphones.
That it is a private beach is not interested and the staff - Turks, Muslims! - they were obviously afraid of them.
They occupied all the sunbeds.
He who was not lying on it and was just in the sea was unlucky.
They were dressed like in an American rap film.
On the heads of the cap with a nail, white and colored adidasky on the legs.
Then they besieged the local beach bar and began feasting.
They occupied the tables around them, crammed up to the brown and white guests of the bar sitting next to them - read to Muslims and Europeans without asking.
Mothers with children fled from the dining terrace somewhere to calm down.
The incoming blacks drank beer straight from the thirds - how about series from the USA ?! - they threw empty bottles around on the beach.
They kept yelling at each other.
However, it was not in English.
Then they started drinking wine, also straight from the bottles.
They jumped into the hotel pool — in designer swimsuits, especially the young ladies — screaming and yelling in the water, the mothers with the children, and the retirees fled in horror, and in half an hour there was not a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They all disappeared.
Whether one was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff was afraid to even talk about them.
In the evening, the waiter said in a low voice, &quot;Did you see the gold they were wearing?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said.
&quot;Well, they definitely didn&#39;t get it from work,&quot; said the waiter.
I remembered, &quot;I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive cross of gold on his neck.
And women were like goldsmiths.
&quot;Are they drug smugglers?&quot; I asked.
&quot;You saw them get drunk,&quot; the waiter replied.
They do not smuggle or use drugs.
They are smuggling something completely different.
So it was clear to me what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105, it wasn&#39;t that important to me yet.
I had no idea what would follow.
But the secret services and top politicians should have known first.
I don&#39;t think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants went to Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today, it has become clear that the European Union&#39;s main problem is that totalitarian-politically-correct politicians, as if intellectuals and the lobbyist and economically important groups attached to them, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now the publicly recognized main force in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, but also EU leaders and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic welcome of refugees in Germany are at the level of August 1968 Moscow television films.
Sure, there were a few sunshine at the station, but most of all - Old German - Muslims welcomed their familymen.
For many weeks, they blabbered on in the news on Czech Television, as according to some research, according to some research, the Germans are almost all for the arrival of emigrants.
But who has only been in Germany for a few days knows that it is a lie like a tower.
Which is confirmed by other information.
For example, the famous public opinion poll organized by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, more than 50% of Germans wanted to receive even more refugees a week ago.
That is also what our television stations were talking about.
However, they concealed what broke out in Germany the next day: that the poll of the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer wanted any immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the poll.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly declared in November 2010, five years ago, &quot;Our quest for a &#39;multi-cult&#39; society has failed miserably.&quot;
She added: &quot;Germany is giving up the fight for a multicultural society.&quot;
&quot;All attempts at such coexistence have totally failed.&quot;
In a country home to four million Muslims, a strategy that has allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating has not worked. They live here with us today and we have been lying for a while that they will not stay, that one day they will disappear again.
But that is not the reality.
The multicultural approach, in which we say that we simply live happily side by side, has failed.
He completely failed.
But even Merkel probably does not have the strength to go against the powerful of Germany and Europe and especially against political correctness.
This is shown by the escalation of events.
The conflict is growing rapidly.
Euro-German Schulz, President of the European Parliament, MP for the SPD, the only one who allegedly does not even have a high school diploma in the European Parliament - yes, one that Berlusconi said in the EU parliament could play a concentration camp supervisor from a minute - demonstrated.
It seems, especially under the impression of recent statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubicon.
Note that, with the exception of some, most European politicians do not support these statements, the statesmen of countries that have been victims of Nazism are appalled.
What happened to the Germans?
With the rich, successful and solid Germans?
For years, who have tried, at least outwardly, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are those right who say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is sown in the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he stopped with all his might the attempts of the Great Germans to take control of the whole center of Europe?
When did he say that the great German idea would destroy Germany?
He probably had.
When he was shut down, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Greater Germany, which led the Germans and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably returned in a different form.
After the Marxists tried to control the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and after the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany on the basis of ecology, for example, which was one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism.
We would say sunshine.
German elites have long resisted the emergence of German nationalism, leaving all those atomic fighters at peace, enthusiasts seeking a paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi motto Our Forest Must Live.
In order to satisfy troubled young people who want to do something different and better all over the world, they have fully sided with the fighters against the warming of the planet, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there was also a strong anti-Semitic - so-called pro-Palestinian - and anti-Slavic current in this current, which considered all Slavs to be difficult verbs - since the time of Karl Marx, who, after his parents, was mainly a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements from Schulz and the German ministers openly threatening the disobedient Eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
Which must be listened to without apology.
Otherwise, woe to you!
And when we add that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And this is, as always, the capital, especially German, which suits him and which is based on the fact that Germany actually controls most European countries through banks and the Union.
The pseudo-faith of the sunshine first led the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism, and today it has brought home and will still bring perhaps millions of Muslims.
Those, lured by the voices of sirens, soon hit a wall of reality that Merkel does not want to see and begin to revolt.
Germany can only once again threaten its neighbors with force, again part of its population - but it seems, an ever smaller part - can ideologically seduce it, but in the end, reality will always catch up with it.
Will Germany burn again?
Muslim hostels are already on fire.
What will the German government do when the German public protests against the incoming Islamists break out?
To whom will Muslims who have long lived in Germany, but certainly not assimilated, come to their aid so as to adopt local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans, fearing the Islamization of their country, fear?
What will it do with the Germans, and Germany in general, when people rise up to protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-superman Muslim?
Germany has simply changed.
The conflict it has provoked in Europe by supporting the sunshine ideology, that is, the ideology of the elitist and essentially totalitarian, and its voracious banks, is growing.
And because of the outspoken treatment of disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient eastern neighbors, this may not turn out well.
Completion tomorrow.

Horned sorrel (Oxalis corniculata).
Tiny weed that tolerates a dry environment.
And so it&#39;s located among the outdoor tiles near my home.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant, which belongs to the expansive weeds, but visually creates a nice impression in terms of flowering.
Between the outdoor tiles is located.
She is unpredictable, she thrives in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, she is easily adaptable, modest and undemanding.
Although it creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it is worth observing and still taking pictures.
Under the microscope is still the beauty of the detail - yellow flowers and green leaves also with purple accompaniment.

The Brazilian pediatric company SPRS came up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the importance of a good diet when breastfeeding with pictures of children sucking from the breast painted with a picture of junk food.
Human breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which supply infants with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the excess of energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets for pregnant women actually affected their children&#39;s genetic production and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it has also been confirmed that unhealthy diets have a negative effect on the child&#39;s immune system.
Seven&#39;s Sunrise dominates the rates, although Nine&#39;s is trying to take the lead on the Today Show
The flight of Karel Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberry to cover the costs of the liberal leadership&#39;s failure failed to create a sufficient increase in ratings for Today.
Nine&#39;s morning show screened from the national capital after the overthrow of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts that also include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
Aussie TV did not seem to care so much about this tyranny of distance, as it averaged 397,000 viewers in five capitals, compared to 330,000 Today.
Today saw a slight increase in its rating compared to Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but their number was only after last Thursday (343,000).
Today, in recent months, it has filled the gap at Sunrise.
In August, there were an average of 318,000 in Today, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect this morning more than just parliament, friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics have wondered if Thomson himself could pull off a television hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night indicates a clear &quot;yes&quot;.
Seven&#39;s The X Factor retained a strong 1.136 million viewers, smoothly beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed views of The Chase Australia&#39;s second night.
The first half hour of Andrew O&#39;Keefe&#39;s new television quiz (5:00 pm to 5:30 pm) averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (from 5:30 pm to 6:00 pm) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire&#39;s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia had an average of 520,000 spectators and the second half an incredible 720,000.
The Hot Seat averaged 620,000.
Due to the drop in The Chase Australia&#39;s rating from the second night, Nine will be convinced that Hot Seat will finally win at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is replaced by Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGuire&#39;s show.

The three in the finale agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect boy - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have inadvertently found out who will win the Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood comes to Bachelora is shrouded in an insurmountable secret.
And the three girls who stay standing will definitely not reveal who is the one who gets the rose in the end.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezany Markoski and Lany Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they inadvertently told us who would win.
Sam Wood keeps his mouth shut until Thursday&#39;s final
All three women lyrically sang why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positivity as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
In any case, when asked, &quot;If not, which one will get Wood&#39;s final flower?&quot;, Their answers could act as a spoiler about who will win the heart of Bacheloro.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay the one that would best suit Wood besides them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have shared a light relationship since one day.
&quot;From the moment I entered the house and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt that they were quite compatible and I still think so during the course,&quot; says Jeavons-Fellows.
&quot;Sarah is a really earthy woman, she has a lot of fun with her,&quot; Markoski added.
I saw them together and there is the right chemistry between them.
They are well and pleasant together.
Sarah Mackay thinks they could form a great couple with Sam Wood.
For her own sake, she claims that during his last visits home, she realized that Wood could be &quot;the right one.&quot;
&quot;As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is no longer just a game - I have now opened my whole heart to him,&quot; he adds.
I asked who Wood would choose if not for her, she looked mysterious.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can say that,&quot; she said.
I like both girls equally - it&#39;s indecisive between Snezena and Lana.
Bachalor airs on Wednesday at 7.30 a.m. on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah&#39;s best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options for starting his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest after his move to the United States, and many teams interviewed after his great start to training late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsul, and it looks like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit for the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which was done by the Australian Rugby League convert during the first kick from the pitch in Tuesday&#39;s 20: 3 win in Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed that he had confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and cast him in the game after injuring Reggie Bush.
Tomsula was also still honest in the locker room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at a post-match press conference.
The 49ers reporter, Cam Inman, said Hayne also received encouragement from a special team coordinator, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and only care about the next game.
Already during the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It certainly wasn&#39;t the start that Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught swearing as he left the field after a mistake and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish &amp; Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 he could not have imagined a worse start to his career in the NFL.
&quot;It happens, you just focus on the next game and that&#39;s it,&quot; Hayne said
Hayne likened the embarrassment to his original debut in 2007, when a record in his own goal area led to the Queensland three.
Overall, it was a great experience for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted a photo with fans holding the Australian flag on his own Instagram after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia&#39;s richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with guns aimed at a Siberian runway.
After openly questioning President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company confiscated and his democratic efforts curtailed.
ÚS defended emigrants who demanded compensation of property.
The couple emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, it was no longer possible to return the property, so the couple turned to the state with a claim for compensation under the Out-of-Court Rehabilitation Act.
The court first awarded them the required amount, ie over 2.8 million crowns, but the appellate court changed their claim by awarding them only less than 90 thousand crowns, referring to the fact that the amount of compensation is determined according to the 1991 price regulations.
The Supreme Court defended the emigrants and slapped the amount originally sued.
However, the Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, turned to the ÚS with a complaint.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the then valid legal regulations - although at that time it represented adequate compensation in relation to the foreclosed property - today it reaches only a fraction of the value of the property.
&quot;This cannot be borne by the interveners as in the restitution of entitled persons who have been claiming their rights at least since 1995 and who have not been able to obtain compensation earlier,&quot; Judge Rapporteur Jaroslav Fenyk explained why the CC sided with the emigrants.
&quot;The CC has repeatedly argued that general courts should proceed in restitution cases so that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled persons and that the purpose of restitution legislation, ie atonement of property wrongs caused by acts of the former totalitarian state, is always achieved,&quot; the judge added.
Evita in the musical of Studio DVA will now be played by Radka Fišarová.
By the way, Radka Fišarová became the world&#39;s youngest Evita, when in 1998, at the age of twenty, she played the role of the wife of the Argentine dictator Eva Perónová in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Weber and Tim Rice at the Spiral Theater in Prague.
To return to the same role, he says: &quot;To date, the performance of Evita has not matched much of the performance.&quot;
Evita is not only an amazing role, it is also a responsibility.
Monika Absolonová recommended her as the first lady of Argentina.
I saw Moncha three times in Evita and it was definitely inspiring for me.
Here I suddenly saw a completely new concept.
I&#39;m quite a fan of more modern adjustments, but this one is just especially successful.
&quot;Ondřej Sokol&#39;s direction is original, light and contemporary,&quot; says Fišarová.
The imaginary handover of the musical scepter between the two singers will take place at Monika Absolonová&#39;s birthday concert on September 27 at 7 pm in the Studio DVA theater.
The evening will culminate with songs from the musical Evita.
The experience will certainly include the joint duet Don&#39;t Cry For Me Argentina (Silence your crying, Argentino!).
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also bounce back from the director&#39;s desk when he plays the role of President Perón during the filming of Karel Roden&#39;s film.
Due to public interest, additional dates were added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech production of the world musical Evita is presented by the Studio DVA theater in cooperation with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
Directed by Ondřej Sokol, the main female role was originally staged by Monika Absolonová.
Alongside her, Karel Roden appears as President Perón and in the role of Che Peter Strenáčik.
Legendary songs from the workshop of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovský are performed by a live orchestra conducted by Kryštof Marek, who took part in the first performance at the Spiral Theater.
4 people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd of protesters against the draft of a new state constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district officer, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered in front of a police station and some were throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal says police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known for their ability to kill but were traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently caused a high number of deaths.
The clash was the last of a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plain of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have set up a new province under a proposed new constitution, and mitigated their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since August 10.
when the four main political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into provinces - a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been going on since 2008, but lawmakers hastened the process following a devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted in Kathmandu this week to establish a draft constitution, officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We must not panic now.
After losing on the ice of the champion Litvínov, you didn&#39;t even manage a home duel with the hockey players of Sparta (3: 5).
Are you not worried about a similarly catastrophic entry into the extra league as a year ago?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

The NHC predicts a 60 percent probability of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
A wide, low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced that it is launching a campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries fleeing war-torn and poor countries. Google doubles each amount selected.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
The report was published on her blog by Google employee Rita Masoudová based on personal experience when she fled her family from Kabul at the age of seven.
&quot;We traveled in many dark trains and buses and we experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear,&quot; said Masoudová.
I was lucky.
But with the worsening immigration crisis in Europe, more and more families like it are willing to help.
All contributions will be distributed among 4 non-profit organizations assisting refugees and immigrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double all contributions made through google.com/refugeerelief to $ 5.5 million.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II. Most of them come from Syria plagued by four years of war, which has driven 4 million people this year alone.
Many people are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Weight loss surgery could be helpful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
&quot;Mortality data takes a long time to display,&quot; says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, wrote an editorial for a new study of JAMA surgery.
Weight loss surgeries, bariatric surgery use various methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been done in people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the relationship of weight to height, is considered normal at values between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates an overweight person, and people above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study of two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy - in the treatment of type 3 diabetes in people who were mild obese.
According to the study, the average BMI among those who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who were not given surgical treatment for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among patients with surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially in 28 cases.
In the drug-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved in only 1 percent and partially only in about 2 percent of patients.
In addition, control of blood pressure, trigylcerides, and &quot;bad&quot; LDL cholesterol has been shown to be &quot;generally better in the surgical group,&quot; the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient&#39;s blood hemoglobin A1c level, which reflects the body&#39;s ongoing blood sugar level.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers said.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the drug-treated group, this value remained at about 8 percent.
But this better &quot;glycemic control&quot; - which is reflected in better hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent vs. 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have remission of diabetes (46.9 percent versus 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to prolonged life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College or Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent greater chance of survival for the next 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an improvement in survival among patients after surgery, according to Blackstone, it is a reassuring result for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in these procedures.
&quot;This is where this work is critical because it states that surgery is safer in a group with a lower BMI,&quot; without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also argues that people and their doctors should start taking weight really seriously after a patient&#39;s BMI drops between 27 and 30.
&quot;I think we&#39;ve been waiting too long to let people know the gravity of the situation,&quot; he says.
I think that once they accumulate these genetic changes that firmly connect their bodies with obesity and diabetes, the way back is already really difficult.
&quot;It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe&quot; - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is unable to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees&#39; home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, which studies ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
&quot;It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,&quot; he said.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria&#39;s efforts to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
&quot;It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring about real peace and real development, especially through the education of these Muslim countries,&quot; he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce killings in their countries.
We must limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems, &quot;he added.
In addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the charges against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, arguing that &quot;the US violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush, advising him that there was no violent way to solve this problem.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences, &quot;said the Dalai Lama.
A fourfold increase in the number of children who have used a sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers around the United States have reported a nearly 400-percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed a highly alcoholic sanitizer, according to the Toxicology Center in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Toxicology Center of Georgia, the number of ingestions of sanitary products for children under 12 years of age reported to poison control centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
&quot;Children access these products more often and unfortunately there is a percentage of children who need to be taken to the emergency room,&quot; Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation intentionally, while some want to impress their friends or as a challenge on social media.
Videos on Youtube show teenagers drinking sanitation due to cheap noise.
Teenagers allegedly mixed a sanitizer with mouthwash containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the attractive scent of the product.
&quot;Children don&#39;t think it could hurt them,&quot; Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitary products) are those that are perfumed.
There are sanitary products with the scent of strawberry, grapefruit or orange, which are very attractive for children.
The sanitizer contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, several loci can indicate alcohol poisoning.
&quot;It&#39;s highly concentrated alcohol,&quot; Dr. Fox, Kansas City&#39;s medical director told the medical director of the Toxicology Control Center at the University of Kansas Hospital. Stephen Thornton.
You wouldn&#39;t let a glass of whiskey just hang around either, but people leave these sanitary products outside, and when children get to them, it&#39;s a quick way to drink alcohol.
Nhaijah Russel, a six-year-old girl who recently ate up to four loci of strawberry-smelling sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency department for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, twice the threshold for adult intoxication, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency doctor who cared for her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah uttered vague words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children&#39;s hospital for any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell because of alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
&quot;It was very scary,&quot; Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah&#39;s mother, told CNN.
It could be deadly for my baby.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or arrange for sanitary facilities out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitation has been linked to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a sanitary product that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Healthcare professionals believed that the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in northern New York planned to poison their &quot;bad&quot; teachers by placing antibacterial products around the room, &quot;according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitary products and forbade their presence in the room.
Police considered the failed plan to be &quot;innocent chatter,&quot; referring to the discipline of the school district,
Rumor: No discrepancy in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplays the talk of discord in Celtic, while Deila admits that the Hoops are in the wrong place, but he turns it around again.
The Hearts will fight the SFA against the attack on Neilson, and Warburton fears that new reinforcements in January will disrupt the team&#39;s unity.
Dons increase their lead over Celtic by 5 points
ADAM Rooney&#39;s first half penalty gave Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, giving the Dons a five-point lead over them and Celtic.
Griffiths denies any discrepancy
This situation has provoked gossip about the disagreement in Celtic, which has been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased supervision in preparation for the match with the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don&#39;t think we feel under pressure, I think players are looking forward to it.
The shortage in the Scottish title rivalry bores the Netherlands - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team leader Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in the Celts - because there is no longer any rivalry between them over the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax&#39;s ambassador, says: &quot;In the Netherlands, they no longer show the best of Celtic matches, and why?&quot;
Because the Rangers are no longer there.
The people here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
He&#39;s talking about the Old Company.
They talk about both teams together and that&#39;s what they&#39;re interested in.
There is a lot of tension in Old Company matches and not only people from Scotland watch these games.
I&#39;ll turn things back to good, Deila agrees.
ROONY Dealia admitted that Celtic stumbled a bit, but the Norwegian boss pledged to turn things back for good.
The defeat by Malm and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, which had only 10 players and now rises to the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, &quot;Celtic has had bad times and will rise again.&quot;
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it&#39;s very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about what&#39;s going on.
We&#39;re just the same - but we have to keep going.
We really, really need Celtic&#39;s support, because it makes the players much better.
It is now very important to stay together.
Warburton is worried about January reinforcements
Despite comments that appeared a few weeks ago, suggesting that he had already identified some of his January goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton fears big purchases of reinforcements and insists he does not want to undermine the unity of the Ibrox team.
The former head of Brentford says: &quot;The January transfer window is very different from the summer one.&quot;
Players who come in the summer have a whole pre-season period to settle in, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes there is more damage by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Celtic Michu&#39;s transfer target indicates retirement
Swansea striker Michu, who was linked to Celtic in the transfer window, indicated that he could retire when his contract with Swansea expired.
The 20-year-old shooter has had problems with his prone ankle for two years and has been unable to find a way out of Wales this summer.
The Hearts will fight the SFA over comments against Neilson
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent to the locker room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on that defender was later canceled - the third red card issued by referee Collum to be called off.
Neilson stands behind his claim, saying, &quot;I didn&#39;t question integrity, I didn&#39;t comment on performance.&quot;
Griffiths pledged to avoid Tynecastle
Stubborn Hibbe was severely reprimanded after admitting that he sang a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolf Skácel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014
&quot;It was a derby and it was a tense moment,&quot; the striker said, continuing: &quot;I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it&#39;s in Celtic&#39;s jersey.&quot;
The Tannadice Council believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that Dundee United still believes in redressing the team&#39;s current management - but admits that the decline on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the boy for the action again, &quot;Donnelly promises.
MCInnes is happy for the &quot;ugly victory&quot; against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to desperately hold out against the Hamilton Accies to win a seventh consecutive league victory and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table with a first-half penalty from Adam Rooney.
McInnes states: &quot;There is no team that has won anything, be it cups or leagues, without winning this type of match.&quot;
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged, while overall UK unemployment is rising
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remains unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that in the UK (5.5 percent), as shown by data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland has fallen by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number of workers now standing at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scotland&#39;s Secretary of State David Mundell said: &quot;The government&#39;s long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy.&quot;
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the labor market and Scottish employment has risen while unemployment has fallen.
Why I witnessed the execution in Oklahoma
Later today, despite late legal intervention, I will watch the man&#39;s death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn&#39;t, I&#39;ll sit in a viewing gallery in the Oklahoma State Prison Death Chamber and see Richard Glossip being executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officials who would witness his death.
I first received the invitation through my best friend in January, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approaches, I&#39;m starting to get scared.
So why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it&#39;s a good way for me to tell you the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer me a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to follow executions in America, and because there are often more applications than vacancies, a morbid lottery is conducted to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats for journalists from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will follow the entire execution impartially.
I can&#39;t do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip&#39;s closest friends and have formed a special bond with him through months of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed a notebook and I will not be able to record what I see.
I&#39;ll just have to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the inmate&#39;s story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that &quot;she could have put it better,&quot; but she still thinks what I&#39;m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn&#39;t tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn&#39;t listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international journalist who will be ready to tell the story on the spot.
He thinks that if he dies, his case will help with anti-death proceedings.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post journalist, will be by my side.
To find out more about the case, please listen to the podcast series I created.
I will not repeat all the details here again.
I can&#39;t say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe he is very likely to be innocent of the murder.
I firmly believe that not enough evidence has been provided to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, the execution is bad.
And it is from this perspective that I will follow his death.
I can&#39;t say I&#39;ll be really objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a person I love dying an unnecessary death.
The man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale remained dry after rescuing a man from the Canning River.
The bet of the man from Petrh that he would flee the police did not come after he got into the shallow muddy water just meters from the policeman, who tried to persuade him to return to shore nonviolently.
Police from Canning Vale were called in for an incident extending into Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn&#39;t get far.
&quot;He was standing in the water and repeating&quot; I&#39;m not going out, just come for me, &quot;said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn&#39;t want to get his uniform wet, so he tried to use safer tactics, namely police negotiations. &quot;
&quot;People sometimes try to do funny things on the run,&quot; Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins gives a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove into a ditch to avoid a bus and tried to cross the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning the biathlon of Ben Cousins.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peeter Moody accused the organizers of Racing Victoria of trying to get a spy into his stable last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He focused on the organizers and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and was based on the belief that they had a personal campaign against him with a late scratch Lady Tatai during maintenance on the day of the race, which was the last straw for him on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for racing and found himself in a difficult situation when it came to Lidarin&#39;s positive cobalt swab, which he could not explain.
He bit his tongue about the espionage charge for 18 months and didn&#39;t want it to look like &quot;dry grapes.&quot;
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to say that I&#39;ve been sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it will all come out at once,&quot; Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I&#39;m going home today and I&#39;m going to sleep well.
I want to walk upside down and let the owners think I&#39;m doing my best for them.
When they start to think the opposite, then I shouldn&#39;t be a coach anymore.
I would then have to consider what I would do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped a bomb in his interview for racing.com that the integrity of the department had tried to spy on him.
&quot;Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I would name after a question - and offered him a job at my stables for finding out about things that were happening in my stables.&quot; Moody said on Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a cheater.
If so, everyone should show their information, because they were completely outraged at trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of that at the time and are still aware of it today.
Should I think it&#39;s becoming a personal matter?
Will the RVL grow a few balls and make people outside the coaching position take responsibility for what is happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe people here think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I&#39;m saying now will give them material to think about.
But I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I don&#39;t care anymore, and I&#39;m sad about it.
It really made me sad.
I will put pressure on them and put a burden on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach&#39;s levels of frustration increased with long-term investigations over cobalt, including Lidari, and a recent scratch made him feel like &quot;he could hours his license on the table.&quot;
Mood, best known for training the undefeated Black Caviar champion, called the treatment rule on the day of the race &quot;ridiculous&quot; after a clay dressing or mud was applied to the horse&#39;s feet, which is against the rules.
It&#39;s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that, &quot;he said.
Someone on my team accidentally applied mud to his leg.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday and it happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treating treatment on the day of the race, for which the organizers have already opened an investigation.
It&#39;s a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
&quot;We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far,&quot; Moody said.
The Cobram driver who passed was arrested
Police arrested a man who knocked down a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and left after a collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist left without stopping and helping the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia confessed to the Shepparton police.
He is expected to be charged with failing to stop in an accident, failing to provide assistance and other traffic offenses.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable condition in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back to rivals over wrestling claims
Craig Bellamy, a Melbourne Storm coach, criticized his players&#39; actions as &quot;setting a plan&quot; for two NRL premiership favorites.
Trent Robinson, coach of Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to &quot;wrest&quot; his players during Storm&#39;s controversial victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly veiled remark on Strorm after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a &quot;show&quot; of rugby league and saying two of Queensland were not &quot;too big&quot; on wrestling.
Bellamy defended the actions of his players and said they concentrated on &quot;contact&quot; during them.
Bellamy added that this situation has boosted his confidence because his team is being criticized by two head coaches, which may mean that they are afraid of losing from the Storm team.
&quot;It&#39;s still coming - I don&#39;t remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,&quot; Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our defensive system and techniques in the last year, in recent weeks we have only emphasized contact during the procedures, and that has meant a turnaround for us.
Trent has been here for three years and he&#39;s obviously coaching a great team, so he&#39;s probably not used to losing, which could be a bit of a shock to him.
It&#39;s funny how things like that always come this year.
Bellamy invalidated Bennet&#39;s idea of &quot;exciting football&quot; and reminded his mentor that Bennet&#39;s St George-Illawarra Dragons team had won the 2010 premiership by playing &quot;boring&quot; football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday play was as exciting as ours. It was just as exciting, &quot;Bellamy said.
I remember St George being criticized in 2010 for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn&#39;t care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds canceling, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
You would like to play this kind of football if you had this type of player available.
He said that in 2010 and now he wants all teams to play his style of football - but not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can&#39;t play that style.
It gives me more confidence because they say such things because they are worried about fighting against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn&#39;t even think about us when they got to big matches.
Bellamy also pointed out that more goals were scored in the Storm and Roosters match than in the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The game of Broncos was probably good, I didn&#39;t look, but what is the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is it exciting football?
Or are breaks and not scoring attempts interesting?
In my opinion, these are agendas.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet again at a certain stage.
Storm have a break this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary finals next Saturday night at AAMI Park. Tickets will be on sale from next morning.
A Serbian man was bailed by $ 200,000 for drug charges
A man who faced a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled from Queensland was bailed by $ 200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested by federal police last month for a 100-kilogram drug from the Solay yacht, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting with the accused in the harbor during the morning and later met with them at Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial-quality cocaine, lawyer Maksimovice argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could be in the coffee shop by accident and innocence.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan thought Maksimovic would flee.
It has a clear connection to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, &quot;he said in the middle of the court.
In the crown case, he lied to the police about where he lived.
Maksimovice&#39;s mother and stepfather jointly offered a bail of $ 200,000 for his release.
&quot;After reading the affidavits of both people, it is clear that the deposit of $ 200,000 is a real financial burden for them,&quot; Judge Flanagan said.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient, as the accused did not appear in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was given bail on the condition that he waive both Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and comply with the curfew from 6 pm to 6 am.
Stevan Hogg used the girl&#39;s phone to entice pedophiles to send pictures
The pedophile used an 11-year-old girl&#39;s phone to take pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl&#39;s phone while she slept, then signed on to her on her online chat, where he had a lot of rude photos of children sent to him by another user.
The girl then woke up to find that she was missing a phone and then found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She went through it and found disturbing news before alerting her mother.
Police got involved and saw five photos, then analytics computers found the address and discovered &quot;disturbing&quot; web searches using terms to search for obscene images of children.
Hogg then told police that his reason was to &quot;guide pedophiles&quot; on the Internet before &quot;pretending to be a police officer and scaring them.&quot;
Fiscal Representative Eilidh Robertson told the Sheriff Court of Dundee: &quot;He said it was an addiction - that it was dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he searched the computer, but claims that he just wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send more.
According to him, he did it to entice them
He claims that he skipped drunkenness and said that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added, &quot;When the girl found the news on her phone, he called her mother, shaking and crying.
She saw obscene pictures on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interrogated and talked about how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, a resident of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to suing or accepting inappropriate images of children on June 14 last year, violated bail terms on January 25, and failed to appear in court on March 24 this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed on a list of sex offenders because he could argue that there was &quot;no fundamental sexual undertone&quot; in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict to October due to reports from social workers.
Hogg was bailed in this case, but was held in custody before hearing about other unresolved cases.
He was placed on a list of sex offenders before the date of his sentence.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe made a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa&#39;s oldest leader, fell earlier this year on the steps leading to the podium.
He was not injured, but the video of his fall became viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tainted by allegations by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats that had warned them against Mr Mugabe&#39;s whistling during his speech.
He was booed and provoked last month during his speech about the state of the nation in parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, chairman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) parliamentary group, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones with warnings not to block Mr Mugabe&#39;s speech.
&quot;The message comes from a number that does not appear, but is called &#39;death,&#39;&quot; he told reporters after Mr Mugabe&#39;s speech.
He warns the members concerned to know that their immunity ends in parliament and that once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity does not work.
The chief said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai had &quot;concerns&quot; about threats against deputies.
Hewlett-Packard plans to reduce jobs by up to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its efforts to restructure and save the cost of the company&#39;s business services.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and services operations.
The expected reduction in jobs will result in a change of about $ 2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
&quot;These restructuring activities will allow us to create a more competitive structure with sustainable spending for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,&quot; said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP and chairman of the board, who will lead the unit after the split.
&quot;Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of stores to help businesses transition to a new style of business,&quot; said Whitman.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving requirements of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of more than $ 50 billion and &quot;will focus on providing unmatched integrated technology solutions&quot; to companies.
This dismantled the company, founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, an electrical equipment manufacturer whose garage in Palo Alto was nicknamed the &quot;birthplace of Silicon Valley.&quot;
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to handle the move from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in America, is the latest in the sector based on the belief that a highly specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must get behind the injured Jack Wilshere in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed for Wilshere that it was still September and that if his rehabilitation went according to plan, there was no reason not to play again at Christmas.
This best case scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his involvement in the next summer European Championship is clearly uncertain.
The great pity of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then regained his former form during the pre-season.
&quot;This type of injury does not jeopardize a career,&quot; says Wenger.
It is a wound that requires healing.
This is nothing special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn&#39;t about his ankles or the injuries he&#39;d suffered before.
This could be true from a purely medical point of view, because Wenger has admitted that there is a relative risk of further injuries whenever any player returns during the season.
An unpleasant pattern also arises here.
Survey conducted by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different Wilsher injuries since he made his game debut six years ago.
During the last five years, he has only played in 65 Arsenal league matches out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective for Arsenal, this means that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, he was one of the two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes the improvement in recorded injuries over the past season will continue.
&quot;Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition,&quot; says Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I&#39;m sure he will and he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal starts the campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb matches with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur the next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will probably join.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Moneal Theo Walcott.
&quot;I&#39;m trying to keep my balance and let the players who need it breathe out,&quot; says Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite to advance from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation as the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo were also not defeated in a total of 41 matches after maintaining the &quot;invincible&quot; campaign last season.
The stadium was shaken by a 3.2 degree Richter earthquake on Wednesday night.
This was the tenth time in Zagreb this year.
Wenger thinks that Arsenal have learned from last season&#39;s Champions League, when he capitulated against Monaco, and he has little hope of leading the club to its first European Cup victory.
&quot;This commitment is tremendous,&quot; says Wenger.
It never happened to Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I have to be a realist.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar depictions in various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperately than ever when it comes to suicides among young men under the age of 15.
In 2013, it was the single leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this issue, Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has identified 2015 as the Year of the Man, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students showing symptoms of depression found that if the victim had a high enough percentage of friends with a &quot;healthy mood,&quot; their chances of recovery doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends represents half the chance of having mental problems.
But for friendship to work, it must, of course, be achievable first.
In this communication through social media with an emphasis on style and not on the content of the message, immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Thanks to our digital lives, our need to look stronger, more fun-loving and more successful has doubled, even though we are more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our true values - our personal desire for growth and friendship - which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game maker recently explained, money doesn&#39;t really buy more luck.
The beauty of the Friends series was the source of this idea for him.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities, who shone through friendly interaction.
Joey&#39;s humor and Chandler&#39;s frequent sacrifices, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross&#39;s desire for Rachel, all stem from the realization that yes, men can also identify with it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
as one Samaritan worker explained to me: .... &quot;my role as a listener of people who feel depressed or have suicidal tendencies really confirmed to me that even the slightest friendly interactions can make a difference.&quot;
Men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with friends.
The old adage &quot;deal with it&quot; is strong in the sense that it will be perceived as weak to open up about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer a longer-term compensation mechanism.
Emphasizes small moments in male friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support must come from a greater close, from a network of friends and family.
So if you are going to FrendsFest organized by Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends for a drink in Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the celebration.
Or when you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship can make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - 236 full episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG sweep Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal against Malm.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut, helping PSG beat Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is a report on the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday&#39;s match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey in the Champions League with a final comfortable 2-0 victory against Malm at the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after his Champions League debut, and the PSG sent the French champions to victory, but then threw away a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored in the head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, so the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they focus not only on qualifying for the elimination rounds, but on improving their way to the quarterfinals, which they have seen in each of the previous 3 years.
But even though they scored three points, it was not Laurent Blanc&#39;s classic performance and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was extravagant in front of the goal and was later replaced against his home team and the club in which he began his famous career in 1999.
&quot;It&#39;s not easy to win outside or at home in the Champions League, so winning 2-0 is a problem for our opponents and looking comfortable in defense is a good start, although there are things we will need to improve as the season progresses,&quot; Blanc said.
That is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, but I regret that we didn&#39;t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic came back after an injury as one of three changes for PSG, who tied 2-2 with Bordeaux in League 1 at home this weekend, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing was described as a man who will take PSG in Europe to a new level after the transfer from Manchester United last month, and showed why, when he ran into Marco Verratti&#39;s pass for Malm&#39;s defense and sent the ball behind Johan Wiland&#39;s back to the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected it to kick off PSG&#39;s spectacular victory, they must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the playoffs and reached this stage, entered with 9 internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders and two retired midfielders were a tough opponent.
But there was an idea to it - the misdirected ball was turned into a cross towards Nikola Djurdjice, who was waiting for it in the box.
Instead, the PSGs themselves benefited from the attack with bad passes and a lousy finish, which was not good even from Ibrahimovice, who failed to fire five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot hit the net shortly after the start of the second half of Cavani.
However, it turned out to be much more suitable when it came to preparing chances for his teammates, and it was from his pass that Di Maria sent a rotating shot that ended in Wiland&#39;s goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal finally came after an hour of play thanks to Cavani, this Uruguayan sent the sixth goal of the season behind the line after Ibrahimovic passed him after a pass from the left wing by Maxwell.
This put an end to all of Malm&#39;s thoughts about the possibility that they could benefit from the match, and only Wiland&#39;s excellent intervention thwarted David Luis&#39; hopes from close range and the score remained unchanged even when the goal of substituting Ezequiel Lavezzi was not recognized at the end of the match.
The coach of the Malmo Age Hareide team apparently admitted that the PSGs were a class higher than his team, Nor said: &quot;Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year.&quot;
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying matches are not enough.
Hat down for Paris.
It was a fascinating match for them.
Glencore earned $ 2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by commodity price collapses, earned $ 2.5 billion on stock sales on Wednesday as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with commodity price crunch as China&#39;s economic slowdown reduces demand and ignites sparks of doom across markets.
The issue of rights sent Glencore stock prices to the top of the London stock market in early morning trades on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of $ 2.5 billion in shares is part of broader plans to reduce its $ 30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third
The company sold new shares at a price of 123 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They got rid of 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent for the group.
Concerns about prolonging the slowdown in Chinese growth have cut the price of iron ore by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House has confirmed that Xi Jinping has visited Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its Tuesday report.
President Xi&#39;s first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama&#39;s visit to Beijing, where the president visited in November, the report said.
US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will invite President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan to a state dinner after the talks.
&quot;President Xi&#39;s visit is an opportunity to strengthen US-China relations and encourages cooperation on international, regional and common concerns, and a constructive debate on the differences between the two countries,&quot; the report added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle, where he will meet several US technical leaders on his way to Washington and then continue to New York for the September UN meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address controversial issues, including Washington&#39;s concerns about China&#39;s alleged cyber espionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis shattered the Schengen area.
An emergency flare fired by Germany did not close the European crew by far, but is already forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem first: it will systematically classify migrants and asylum seekers as they enter the old continent - especially in Greece, rather than arguing over the future allocation of refugees by quota on the basis of it is increasingly moving away from reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to redistribute 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the member states changed priorities.
Before caring for the final destination of refugees, it is first necessary to filter those who are already arriving today and to resolve the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
&quot;Effective management of the EU&#39;s external borders is essential for managing migration,&quot; he said in a text discussed by ministers in Brussels on Monday.
Following the single currency crisis, the EU is finding itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it is not losing its resolve and increasing pressure.
It renews border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the influx of asylum seekers in that country.
The Central Power thus makes it clear that without it, no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday already served as proof.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also thinking about it, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has done so long ago.
These exceptional and temporary measures are permissible under Schengen rules.
But he also sees that it is a domino effect blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris now is the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already gone inland.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and his German colleague Thomas de Maizière discussed this intensively during a private conversation with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is by no means new, but it is realized in a rigid way.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two thirds of newly arrived refugees have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest refuses to introduce any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that camps in which refugees will gather on its behalf do not remain on its shoulders.
Greece remains a real black hole.
More than 200,000 people have landed on its islands off the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as have recently arrived in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through crowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It&#39;s a huge gaping hole.
Athens, still in financial turmoil awaiting a new government, has folded its hands.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises that checkpoints will be introduced as soon as possible, but has not given any number or date.
&quot;The challenges facing Greece apply to the whole of Europe,&quot; EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilize on the front.
It is therefore a matter of deploying the European Border Intervention Agency intervention teams in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its reception capacity for asylum seekers and strengthen surveillance of the islands.
&quot;Adequate financial resources will be needed,&quot; warns the text submitted to ministers for approval.
From a legal point of view, Athens will continue to have the last word.
The question of the creation of real European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is approaching it.
The new emergency situation of the 28 has pushed the issue of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees, raised by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament at the beginning of the year and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still do not want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, but not the obligation, was maintained on Monday in a text approved by a majority of 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise involves the redistribution of 40,000 refugees over the next two years, which was already agreed in June during a hectic EU summit, concludes Le Figaro.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, allegedly three Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
According to the authorities, the nationality is also a woman who is the only one of the affected group of eight to survive.
Previous media reports said it was Polka.
A woman in her thirties was hospitalized in Briancon with a serious leg injury in the femur.
According to AFP, the dead were mostly people in their forties.
&quot;The rescue operation is over, and the bodies of the victims have also been transported to Briancon for identification,&quot; said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The accident happened around noon in the Pelvoux mountain area below the top of the Dôme de Neige des Ecrins mountain measuring 4015 meters.
&quot;The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high,&quot; said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
According to him, a huge amount of snow fell on a group of eight at an altitude of about 3,900 meters.
Today, the meteorological service did not warn the area of bad weather.
Trpišovský before the match with Braga: Finally real Europe.
During his premiere in the cups, coach Jindřich Trpišovský was able to go through the preliminary rounds of the European League with the Liberec football players to the basic group and now he is looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
Slovan will welcome the 2011 finalist Braga at the beginning of the main phase of the competition and, according to the coach, wants to impose his style of play on her.
After all the nerves in the elimination fights, when every goal and every situation could knock you out on the way to the dream group, now we are there and we will play six matches.
Of course we want to win, but we don&#39;t have to be afraid of every goal collected, we can play our tactics and we are not bound by a mere double match.
&quot;I&#39;m really looking forward to it and it&#39;s real Europe, before that it was just a qualification,&quot; Trpišovský said at a press conference.
He considers Bragu to be a top team.
He will be very active, they have only Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may just be harder even because he does not have such a name, but at the same time he has a player in his staff who, I suspect, scored three goals for Manchester.
&quot;It is an excellent team at the level of top teams,&quot; stated Trpišovský.
But he doesn&#39;t consider Brag to be a clear favorite.
I take it we play at home, so we&#39;re definitely not outsiders.
&quot;I think that we have shown both in the domestic competition and in the preliminary rounds that we are strong at our stadium, and we want to confirm that,&quot; said the coach, whose team lost only the inaugural Super Cup in Pilsen out of eleven duels this season.
He believes that Liberec can also impose its style on Braze.
We will have a team that will be strong on the ball, and at the same time atypically disciplined for them.
They play from the 4-4-2 formation with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
&quot;He is a very difficult opponent, we have discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the field,&quot; said Trpišovský.
We studied our opponents a lot in the preliminary rounds, which helped us a lot, this time we want to focus on our game, to which we also adapted the training.
&quot;And we definitely want, although it will be very challenging, to be played according to our notes,&quot; the coach added.
Student films will dominate Písek, an international festival begins.
This year, over 350 authors from 51 countries entered their works in the competition of the 15th International Student Film Festival in Písek.
Forty of them, which the commission of students and teachers sent to the finals, will be screened from 15 to 18 October in the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be selected by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jakub Charvát.
Every year, the festival has its own special theme, which is based on the festival&#39;s motto.
This year it&#39;s a detective story.
The director of this year&#39;s gala evenings, Richard Blumenfeld, plans to combine elements of television, film and theater.
&quot;And, of course, we must also solve the crime that was committed in our trailer this year,&quot; said Charvát.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student&#39;s work - feature, animated and documentary films.
They will be judged by an international jury, which will include last year&#39;s winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the festival organizers prepare an accompanying program.
Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia will come, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbo-chanson group Poletíme ?, playful band Zrní or Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the Bar.
The festival will also host two photo exhibitions.
The first will be brought by Jana Ašenbrennerová, a graduate of the Písek Film School and the holder of prestigious awards, including the one from World Press Photo 2014.
The second exhibition will present the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake.
Cameraman and documentary filmmaker Martin Čech will come to the discussion with the visitors, the silent film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber with his music and Brukner, Novotný and Hlach, natives of the sand, will baptize their new book 3 friends from P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, the patron saint of FAMO in Písek, who recently left us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy, which will live on.
&quot;Young people from all over the world will continue to gather here, exchange experiences and develop common ties and film craftsmanship,&quot; said the spokesman.
The Pitching forum will certainly help, as students can meet film professionals, take part in several job auditions at once and get a job.
The festival is connected with the establishment of the Private Higher Vocational Film School in Písek.
Its founders, husband and wife Vladana and Miloň Terč, organized the first year in 1997.
Until the sixth year, it was held once every two years.
In the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency, insurance companies have to pay the clients&#39; claims in full.
Insurance companies should pay clients&#39; claims in the event of the travel agency&#39;s bankruptcy in full.
The Chamber of Deputies decided on Wednesday when it approved an amended amendment to the Act on the Conditions of Business in Tourism.
According to the draft, which is to be submitted to the Senate for assessment, travel agencies will be able to replace bankruptcy insurance with a bank guarantee.
Insurance companies do not agree with the obligation to pay clients&#39; claims even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Regional Development insists on the regulation, argues consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end the insurance of travel agencies against bankruptcy when the amendment comes into force.
However, the proposal is also criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they will either have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Regional Development Karla Šlechtová (for YES) pointed out that cases where insurance companies did not pay full compensation are not Euro-compliant.
She drew attention to this year&#39;s decision of the Constitutional Court, which confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
Insurance companies will receive enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to determine the right limit, stressed Šlechtová.
&quot;We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit that it is feasible,&quot; opposed the deputy chairman of TOP 09 Miroslav Kalousek.
According to him, the bank guarantee will not work, because no one will give it unlimited.
&quot;Travel agencies will have to close down or move abroad,&quot; Kalousek warned.
Tomio Okamura (SPD), a member of the presidium of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies, disagreed with Kalousek&#39;s concerns based on a survey among member travel agencies.
&quot;Stop showing us insurance lobbying,&quot; he said.
Okamura does not consider the statements of insurance companies to be relevant; according to him, there is no official written statement to that effect.
However, they are said to find out whether travel agencies will be co-participating, which, according to Okamura, is not a problem.
Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the rival Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about erasing the stairs of Czech travel agencies, also warned against the appointment.
According to Fischer, travel agencies will not be able to take out insurance.
&quot;Consumer protection works,&quot; says Fischer.
Her proposal to delete the disputed passage was not approved by the Chamber of Deputies.
Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) did not come up with a proposal to return the draft to the committee due to an alleged conflict with the Civil Code.
Filip drew attention to travel agencies, which he said could endanger consumers.
The rapporteur of the draft, Martina Berdychová (YES), withdrew her proposal in view of the verdict of the Constitutional Court, which would limit the liability of insurance companies in cases where they could not know that the insurance benefit would not cover the entire risk.
The amendment will not originally propose a minimum limit of four million insurance for travel agencies that offer tours by air, and a million limit for offices selling, for example, bus tours.
The limit will remain at 30 percent of planned tour sales.
However, the limit of insurance indemnity will have to be such that in the event of the bankruptcy of the travel agency it covers all the claims of customers.
Even after amendments, the standard stipulates that travel agencies will have to state anew for travel tours which travel agency organizes the trip.
Travel agencies will have to provide insurance companies with, among other things, data on management and the number of trips before concluding the contract.
The approved amendment of the Public Administration Committee also provides for further regular information of insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to supply them each month with information on the number of passengers and tours sold, the total price of the tours sold and the amount of advances and sales for and for vouchers.
If the Ministry of Regional Development finds that the travel agency has not fulfilled any of its legal obligations to the insurance company, it will call on it to rectify it according to the draft or may prohibit it from concluding new contracts if the breach could jeopardize customers&#39; interests.
The amendment is also intended to newly regulate the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Regional Development will determine the amount of the subsidy to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which it will always submit by the end of April for the following year.
The application will include a report on the use of state money last year, a financial expenditure plan and a forecast for the next two years.
According to the association, however, the submitter of the law did not think about the situation what would happen if the insurance company terminated the contract of the TA.
It will not be allowed to organize tours and clients who bought the tour before the termination of the insurance will lose it according to the association.
In such a case, the TA will suffer a significant loss and may even go bankrupt, even though its management was in good condition.
One way in which travel agents can cope with such a situation would be to sue the state for compensation.
Another option will be to go abroad and use much softer conditions abroad, and in our market we will only act as agencies, said Jan Papež, vice-president of the association.
According to him, the draft amendment also includes the institute of a bank guarantee, but so recklessly that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, because a bank guarantee cannot sound for an unlimited amount.
In addition, according to the association, a change in current practice is de facto unnecessary.
In two years&#39; time, the whole law will have to be recast in the light of the new EU directive.
A total of 942 active insured travel agencies now operate on the Czech market.
This year, only three travel agencies ended their activities.
Domestic travel agencies sell tours worth approximately CZK 20 billion annually.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve humanitarian conditions in the refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the arrival of refugees in Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after talks with the German state prime ministers.
At the same time, she reiterated her call for the distribution of refugees who have already arrived in the EU among the 28 member states.
We need to help more the countries from which refugees are leaving or where they are staying after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will work for dignified conditions in refugee camps, such as in Jordan and Lebanon, said the German Chancellor, who said such a signal could be increased financial assistance or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organizations.
&quot;The Länder also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the weight of the refugee crisis among European countries,&quot; Merkel added.
In this context, Brandenburg&#39;s Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said at a press conference that he expected real solidarity from all EU states.
The distribution of refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas has long been rejected by the Czechia, among others.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke in favor of speeding up the asylum procedure in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also needed for the authorities to be able to start integrating foreigners more quickly, said the Prime Minister of Brandenburg.
According to him, it is also necessary that most of the money that Germany spends on caring for refugees is used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
More teachers will be needed for refugees to master German.
It is a great challenge for our country, but I believe that if the refugees can be integrated, they can be of benefit to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplays the diversity in the film
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a debate on diversity, arguing that it was not necessary behind the scenes.
During Sunday&#39;s episode of the HBO project Greenlight, the actor cast in the series interrupted Brown, stressing the need for alternative perspectives on the black protagonists in the script.
&quot;When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a film and not by casting a show,&quot; says Damon.
Shocked, Brown responded indignantly with disbelief and sighed &quot;Hoo! Wow. Okay,&quot; as comments about Martan came on the air.
Damon and Brown teamed up with co-known producer Ben Affleck and the Farrell brothers to discuss the show&#39;s finalists.
&quot;I&#39;d like to appeal to people to think, no matter who the director is, how they will treat Harmony&#39;s character,&quot; Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character who is a hooker packed by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People advocated finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon retorted that their direction &quot;could eventually give us something we don&#39;t want.&quot;
After the discussion aired, social media exploded inconsistent with Damon&#39;s comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at writing the clip, &quot;Matt Damon jumped into the talk of the only black woman in the room, so he can explain to her that diversity is SO WHITE it hurts.&quot;
Tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was published.
Damon&#39;s comment comes at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took on national effect and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made allusions to the movement while stating nominees for the Album of the Year category during the Grammy Awards.
&quot;Albums are still important,&quot; he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
The latest leader of the Black Lives Matter movement introduced a statement in response to a question from Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
&quot;The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,&quot; the leaders said.
Damon was recently reported on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not clear whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the pope.
&quot;American Ninja Warrior has its first winner&quot;
Professional climber and piccolo Isaac Caldiero became the first contestant to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, taking home $ 1 million.
In the competition, which has just ended its seventh season, none of the competitors managed to overcome all the obstacles on the track.
During the finals of this season, two men made it to the last round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last obstacle was a 30-second climb over more than 220 m long rope.
Britten was the first to complete the climb within the set limit and thus became the first competitor to overcome a grueling 4 sections in the American Ninja Warrior, however, Caldiero overcame it by a full three seconds and won the competition.
Caldiero gave an interview for the news! News right after his hard-won victory and it was recognized that he is still in shock from winning the main prize worth $ 1 million.
&quot;It&#39;s an amazing feeling, I&#39;ve never made more than $ 10,000 a year in my life,&quot; said Isaac E! in response to your win.
&quot;So all of a sudden ... I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s going to be like now.&quot;
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the finale and why Britten will not receive any rewards, despite the fact that he became the first competitor to complete the track.
According to the rules, the money belongs to the one who completes the track the fastest.
&quot;If more than one competitor participates in the track, the winner will be the one with the best time,&quot; said Weed.
Although winning the main prize would change his life, Britten is happy with his performance.
&quot;I don&#39;t think he harbors resentment.
He is glad that he managed to achieve what he did.
He received a warm welcome from the fans.
He&#39;s a great guy and he loves his family.
He is a hero to his children and wife. &quot;
Geoff told me, &quot;If there was to be someone who could beat me, I&#39;m glad it was Isaac.&quot;
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just walked past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS - For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season was not exactly a walk in the rose garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams, is now in last place in the Central Division of the American League.
The Tigers just averted their defeat when they defeated Mininessota in a close match 5-4 at Target Field in Tuesday&#39;s match.
The twins missed the chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and capture the second wild card in the American League.
Even if only for one night, for Detroit it was the return of the word to Z that was so elusive for them during the second half of the season.
&quot;Winning is always fun, no matter how,&quot; said Tiger Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his offensive start and Detroit scored three times in the first two innings and then took another in the sixth and ninth inning.
Simon (13-9) allowed the opponent 6 1/3 shots and 3 rounds.
It was only his third successful game of the last nine matches.
&quot;I want to end this year with convincing results,&quot; said Simon.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to get into a match when you&#39;re often on the bench, so I want to get into the game.&quot;
Tiger batsman Victor Martinez hit three times and made 2 rounds and made his first point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was the first three-point game since the last game in June, in which he hit four times against the Seattle Mariners.
&quot;He leaned in nicely,&quot; Ausmus said.
&quot;He looked good in training, fired noticeably better and managed to transfer it to the match.&quot;
Thanks to three rounds at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins got the best chance to return to the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton won the inning thanks to two points on the left side of the field.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks scored a point thanks to the set bat and Simon kicked out Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy eliminated his only opponent, Mauer, and had batsman Miguel San in front of him, who hit the ball and circled two goals, leaving right-hander Drew VerHagen behind.
With two players on the goals and a chance to draw in the second inning, VerHagen managed to send the third sweeper over two goals.
Plouffe has already gained 27 runs over two goals this season and reigns supreme in the league table.
Detroit held the ninth inning, Mauer scored two points and Bruce Rondon secured a 5-4 score for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander ruled out Sana for three coincidences.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in Phil Hughes&#39; game.
The Tigers gained three rounds in the first two innings against a retired right-hander who came into play after a break of more than a month due to inflammation of the back muscles.
&quot;I certainly didn&#39;t imagine such a start,&quot; Hughes said, &quot;but during the third inning I already felt that I was throwing better.&quot;
After resisting the onslaught in the first inning, Hughes scored one point to second sweeper Ian Kinsler.
Two departures for the right polar JD Martinez brought Victor Martinez, who was the first to go around all the goals.
Victor Martinez interrupted his series 0-21.
Third sweeper Nick Castellanos followed him with a point on the right side of the field and scored another pass, but Victor Martinez was thrown when he tried to run to the third goal.
The Tigers added in the second inning when pitcher James McCann and polarist Anthony Gose scored two and then one point and the score was 3-0.
&quot;That got us to our knees,&quot; said Twin Manager Paul Molitor.
&quot;He didn&#39;t hit the ball very well, but he got it in the right place.&quot;
Hughes, who won the number of throws, finished in the third inning without points and was replaced by right-hander AJ Achter.
Hughes ran three goals, scored six shots and 4 strikes.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right Tiger pitcher, ended the match with pain in his right shoulder.
He will be cared for by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez&#39;s arm in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injuries due to stretched muscles in his shoulder since mid-August, should start in Wednesday&#39;s match.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-hander Daniel Norris, who will return after being injured and play against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was traded for left-handed pitcher David Price, he has scored 1-1 after 4 matches.
However, he has not played since August 20 due to a stretched muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Minrisot left bowler Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) will face Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA).
Xi calls for the economy to be opened up to the wider world
The economy needs to be opened up to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with managing governance on Tuesday.
&quot;China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies,&quot; he said of the 16th session of the central leader of the group to deepen overall reform.
Promoting openness in nascent reforms will give new impetus and vitality, as well as new space for economic growth, says Xi.
The lead group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the loosening of border control policy, the promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganization of the resident registration system.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up, identifying sectors and companies that are out of investment limits.
This system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
The move is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and make sure that the companies themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also said that China would allow border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up a state-controlled industry, more areas will be open to private investment.
&quot;The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services,&quot; the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a &quot;green card,&quot; by optimizing requirements and simplifying the application process.
Ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at the meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
New wards may be established in the Karlovy Vary region.
According to the Deputy Governor of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Pánik (ČSSD), the current capacity of the inpatient departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between departments of individual hospitals.
However, there are also possibilities in the region to expand care.
For example, in the departments of surgical departments, one-day surgery centers could be established, where, according to the set concept, surgical specialties would be performed that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours.
It is not yet clear which specific hospitals there should be workplaces focused on one-day surgery.
At the dermatology department of the Karlovy Vary Hospital, a laser center could be established with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
The concept also recommended the creation of an apallic center to care for patients with brain disorders who are in a vegetative state.
Such a center should be established centrally and should be an integral part of the anesthesiology and resuscitation department.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in the Ostrov hospital, where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity that appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary Region is aftercare beds, especially beds for long-term patients (LDN), whose capacity in Nejdek is insufficient and, above all, should be closely related to acute care beds.
Part of this facility should function as rehabilitation beds and part as classic LDN beds, the concept recommends.
As he points out, aftercare beds are missing mainly in the Karlovy Vary hospital.
Abandoned buildings after centralization could be used there.
Last but not least, there are no social health beds in the Karlovy Vary region focusing on the treatment of Alzheimer&#39;s disease.
There is a shortage of these beds throughout the country, so it could also serve as a so-called Alzheimer&#39;s Center for other regions.
According to the recommendations, hospitals should also prepare for the introduction of so-called connecting beds, for which funds from European subsidies will be released.
&quot;These are beds that will be connected to the fields of super-specialized care and will form a space for the translation of patients after the procedure, for example after cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other surgery,&quot; describes the regional concept of inpatient care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
