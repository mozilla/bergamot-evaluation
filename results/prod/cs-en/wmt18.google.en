The civil rights movement has issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Favor of People of Color (NAACP) has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
&quot;The NAACP Travel Recommendations for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and residents of Missouri to pay close attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently taking place across the state. , &quot;Says the association&#39;s statement.
The NAACP said it had taken the move under current Missouri law, which makes it difficult to defend racist acts in court, as well as as a result of law enforcement actions that disproportionately target minorities.
&quot;Civil rights are being violated.
People are stopped by police just because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed, &quot;Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP for Missouri, told Kansas City Star.
&quot;We have the largest number of complaints so far.&quot;
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the US state.
Incidents cited by the organization included racially motivated swearing at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the country and being thrown into custody by police without charge of a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General&#39;s Office that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by the police.
&quot;The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri,&quot; Chapel said.
&quot;People need to be prepared - they should carry money to pay bail or warn their relatives that they are going to travel in the state.&quot;
According to current FBI figures, there were hundreds of cases of hate behavior in Missouri in 2015, ranking the state sixteenth among all states.
The travel alert is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in the provision of housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows government officials to detain people for violating the law, which the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family is still calm even after 12 years!
Model Sally Anne Bowman is murdered.
A girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie right in the restaurant where she worked, who dealt her stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana together, then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe, watching the forensic crime search.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
In court, he only admitted to assaulting a juvenile, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found the girl dead lying on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were arguing on a fateful night.
The killer said, &quot;He was really upset and after his attack the girl started screaming.&quot;
&quot;It even attracted the attention of taxi drivers,&quot; he said falsely.
According to him, the girl was supposed to defend herself, she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie&#39;s version was proven a lie and accused him.
After confessing, Dixie talked about his horny and appetite for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light marijuana.
Prior to the incident, Sally was with his ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told police.
He said he felt adrenaline pumping.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth, &quot;added the Mirror Linda.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying its grave.
He has been injured four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people at large who dig these graves.
&quot;So our daughter is no longer there,&quot; the Mirror&#39;s mother, the mother of the deceased girl, told the news that the urn with the ashes had disappeared.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
&quot;Czechs are not prudish or conservative,&quot; says Martin Ráž, who runs the Intimity boutique in Prague.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started inconspicuously, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bike trip around Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
&quot;Different moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different,&quot; he tells me over lunch.
His friend and another companion decided to work with the German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which interested Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When his companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he operates the Intimity boutique in Prague&#39;s Benediktská Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, you&#39;re talking about this at lunch, you think?
But come on, don&#39;t be such a Puritan!
It was the Berlin Fun Factory store, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic business than everyone is used to here.
No covered shop windows, all done in a beautiful, discreet style, products displayed more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to understand the Prague store, where it should be and what its name should be.
Both liked the name Intimacy.
&quot;It&#39;s related to intimacy, after all, and it&#39;s, so to speak, tender,&quot; he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the variant that divided the shop into a garden of pleasure and a bedroom dominated by a bed won.
It was prepared for us by Dagmar Štěpánová from the FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first it didn&#39;t seem perfect to us, because it&#39;s not on the main street, but thanks to that, it was sitting next to the name Intimacy.
He is intimate.
It is in the alley next to the main one, so no one is looking for customers, &quot;praises Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a business that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of entering into such a deal at all.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
In addition, I didn&#39;t even feel like going to an erotic shop.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female attendant in the store, the fact that women are not ashamed to ask for help does not mean that a man&#39;s foot will not come here.
Mostly gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
&quot;Men usually can&#39;t estimate the right size and choose bigger ones,&quot; Martin smiles at the common mistake.
These are the prejudices, the clichés that women need some great tools, and it&#39;s not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an unnecessarily large vibrator, for example.
In the same way, men choose mostly black underwear, while a woman usually tends to be pink.
The absolute bestseller at present is a product aptly called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don&#39;t know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It is such a non-contact clitoral stimulator.
I feel the adolescent need to chuckle with admiration for the serious tone with which my interpretation is given.
As if it wasn&#39;t frosting.
And it doesn&#39;t actually frost.
It is for a good price and has perfect user references.
We did not believe that he would be so well received.
This is a kind of latest revolutionary innovation.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a seahorse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was the We-Vibe steam vibrator.
He completely broke the taboo that can persist in some men, that he sees competition in erotic devices.
&quot;Different variants are being made,&quot; he continues.
With one motor, with two motors, with remote control.
This is a popular category.
In a love affair, a woman can have a remote control in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain loser is the category of application vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they may only use it externally.
At the same time, it is very popular in Western Europe, especially with younger customers.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would work exclusively for men.
It would probably have to be treated a little differently.
The question is what to offer men, &quot;Martin thinks.
&quot;We have the tools for them, too, but to a limited extent.&quot; The best-selling masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but &quot;more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
Much focuses on functionality and in-use experiences.
In Japan, it is completely different.
It amazes me.
I thought that the Japanese would suffer a lot from erotic aids, I object.
&quot;That&#39;s the internet reality,&quot; he explained.
The mundane one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more about being used by women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women. &quot;Just for fun - what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide still accounts for about half of what is sold in Japan alone.
In our waters
Czechs are not prudish at all.
On the contrary, we are quite a supportive nation.
Definitely unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and &quot;already has some experience with both her sex life and some aids.
She will come for something nice, better to complement her partner&#39;s life, or for herself. &quot;Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of her return by making sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also don&#39;t want to embark on specialties such as bondage and latex, because on the one hand we don&#39;t have the space for that, on the other hand, it&#39;s definitely not suitable here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are people who have always been ashamed to go to a sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would peek out at them.
Lots of products displayed on the shelves are really pleasing.
It is also given by the selection of represented renowned brands.
Some have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The very first to be awarded was the aforementioned seahorse &quot;and that triggered a change in the whole industry.
It started to abandon cheap materials and, conversely, work with harmless ones, other designs, different colors began to be produced ...
It is nice that the Czech Republic is behind the design of some, namely the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I must say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy the Whoop.de.doo design items from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly to Venus&#39;s balls by Anna Marešová.
She did a really huge job by presenting exactly what we are trying to present in the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna&#39;s story began as a school job.
Now it is a finished product, which is also manufactured by us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made from.
Because it is not a large-scale production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than large series.
Maybe I&#39;m going a little against the current, but I think it&#39;s important to keep the development in our country in the Czech Republic.
It could easily happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything, &quot;Anna later describes the situation to me, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
He does not encounter a negative or negative attitude.
People are most embarrassed.
&quot;But then they&#39;ll start smiling too.&quot; Anna Marešová currently offers a vibrator for which you can have a personal message made, and this year she is also planning her own lubricating gel.
Vibrating eggs and other novelties should be added next year.
The limits of healthy sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what&#39;s right lie.
Is there something that Martin Ráž would no longer sell?
It&#39;s very difficult to define.
What may seem normal to one may seem completely abnormal to another, so we limit ourselves to the range of branded manufacturers.
None of them ventures into any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just now in the week, an e-mail arrived asking a lady to ask for a masturbation aid for her friend, who was twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write to us that unfortunately we don&#39;t have anything like that.
The question is still whether any of us were kidding, &quot;Martin measures me with a suspicious look.
This also happens from time to time ...
A blow to Karel Gott.
After two Alzheimer&#39;s cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is struggling with a serious illness.
Karel Gott&#39;s best friend is battling a disease that steals all people&#39;s memories.
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s unfortunately true,&quot; the singer himself confirmed Blesk&#39;s sad information.
I know about my illness and so far, given the circumstances, I manage it quite well.
&quot;I am taking medications to slow down the concomitant effects of the disease,&quot; he added, adding that he thanked loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family came together to make Karl&#39;s life easier.
The wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, the daughters from the first marriage Zuzana and Tereza also come to the house on Bílá Hora to see their father, the son Karel called Karlas takes care of it.
Štědry fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him in his demanding treatment.
He has undergone sixty chemotherapies.
He was able to return to work and to the tennis court and ski slopes.
&quot;I am predicted by the astrologer that I will be here by the age of ninety,&quot; Karel Blesku said.
He&#39;s a warrior.
He still wants to sing.
&quot;I keep repeating the words of the songs so that I don&#39;t forget them,&quot; Karel admitted.
Actress Květa Fialová is already battling the same disease at the institute.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer&#39;s family?
See how to treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortions, the law will be assessed by the Constitutional Court.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on abortion, so it must not be done for health reasons either.
&quot;I am sorry that the legislators have lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will be deciding what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years,&quot; Socialist Senator Isabel Allende complained.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and should receive a new president at the end of August, who, according to the AFP, is close to the opposition.
The law repealing the absolute ban on abortions, initiated by current president Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court because it said it violated the unborn child&#39;s right to life.
Deputies postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was analyzed by a joint parliamentary commission.
On Wednesday, deputies approved the proposal, after which the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, abortion should cease to be a criminal offense in three cases: if a woman&#39;s life is endangered, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
An absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortions.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars serving prison sentences of up to 30 years for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called murder.
Is there anything sacred at all?
The target of Trump&#39;s White House is now the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of a regime change is a critique of the statues.
Americans could talk about it as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein&#39;s statue in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was up to when he set off for the Statue of Liberty with a symbolic ax during a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the president&#39;s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants.
It should be added that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For that, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acosta with, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the world.
The poem that was additionally placed on the pedestal and to which you refer is not part of it. &quot;
Miller is actually right, but as he put it, this is not about history.
These are the astonishing words of Emmy Lazarus, which resonate today - inviting not only immigrants but also the poorest of the poorest: “Let me come who fall, who poor, who can barely breathe, who can hardly breathe in the midst of full cities. &quot;
And in modern times we can better than ever watch these &quot;poor worms&quot; on our screens.
Miller did not seek to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict over the significance of the statue is part of a widespread political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict over the significance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to place a plaque with a poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was to express the union of the French and American republican governments by representing the classical theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of Exiles.
Combining the poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse this meaning.
Well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on Trump&#39;s rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not actually invite anyone into the country, but represented early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to a backward world: &quot;The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
It brings the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the journey to the United States. &quot;
Surprisingly, Limbaugh comes across an important thing.
The significance of the sculpture depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned passenger who, after a long and frightening voyage across the ocean, often arrives in the heart of a new country with hope.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that&#39;s, of course, a perspective that Miller and Trump certainly won&#39;t recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black sings praises to Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the athletic federation of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, said that the strong squadron of 16 Scots in the World Cup team will be a &quot;huge benefit for the team&quot;.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the London 2017 World Championships, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that &quot;something special is happening&quot; in Scotland, and British athletics could learn a lot from the Scots.
&quot;We&#39;re trying to understand and adapt - we&#39;ll work on it,&quot; Black said.
&quot;I&#39;ve talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they did.
Scottish athletics think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets also think so.
Whatever it is, it&#39;s absolutely amazing. &quot;
Several Scottish athletes will aim for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain.
&quot;Eilidh is modest.
Her introductory speech was amazing, &quot;said Black.
&quot;Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of great pride and motivation.
The passion and unconcealed feelings that Eilidh spoke to were unrepeatable. &quot;
The Commonwealth Silver Medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Cup, said it was &quot;unbelievable&quot; that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Middle-aged runner Muir has set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
He will take part in the 1500 m and 5000 m run at the World Championships.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O&#39;Hare, who will run the track at 1500 m. This season he won the British team races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of the team, Lee McConnell.
The team captain led her to be &quot;very proud&quot; of the fact that not only did a large number of her colleagues join the team, but in many cases they would also attack the participation in the finals and medals.
&quot;It is unusual for a team captain to be elected by other team members. It was a great honor for me, but the knowledge that the team members elected me is gratifying, &quot;she added.
&quot;Obviously I&#39;m very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
It proves where we&#39;ve moved.
They are athletes who will think of leading positions on the podium.
And my introductory speech?
Yes, I think she did it.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud of this year&#39;s championship, because it takes place at home.
It is important to take advantage of the support of domestic fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race and I will enjoy the incredible atmosphere. &quot;
Critics blocking on Facebook: don&#39;t run for public office unless you can stand criticism of voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn&#39;t take long for the newspapers to criticize him for anything from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he did not try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, &quot;Freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and the foolish and dumb will be led like sheep to slaughter.&quot;
That brings me to Maryland&#39;s Gov. Larry Hogan, whom he needs to work on to start behaving like Washington.
Hogan&#39;s staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who were free to express their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Union for Civil Liberties for those acts.
The governor&#39;s staff dismissed the lawsuit as unfounded, and many &quot;who cares&quot; views appeared on the Internet.
&quot;It&#39;s just Facebook,&quot; many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not irritable.
As can be seen, he manages his state with certainty of his own and strictly adheres to the principles.
He also proved to be adept at using Facebook as the main means of connecting with his constituents - with the exception of the publication of the first bald-headed photograph after receiving chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor&#39;s site - which is a public forum marked as official and managed by his employees paid with taxpayers&#39; money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with Washington Post, Hogan&#39;s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor, saying the comments were blocked from a moderating position.
However, using the image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people whose posts had been deleted.
And that&#39;s exactly what they are - real people who talk to their elected leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan&#39;s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Lawyer Sarma Ramani, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hate.
&quot;I politely remarked that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other current news,&quot; she wrote in the comments section of the Washington Post.
&quot;I don&#39;t like the idea that once a number of people comment on the same topic, some people label it as promoting a so-called collective effort, instead of recognizing it as a larger group of interested citizens.&quot;
What the governor&#39;s staff called &quot;concentrated spam interest&quot; others would probably call &quot;defense.&quot;
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all prints with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces a lawsuit from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important ordinances was born last week in Virginia.
According to district judge James C. Cacheris, the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment in Alexandria, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn&#39;t be that difficult.
In Washington&#39;s day, the low cost of postage had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of dailies quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms like &quot;Juricola&quot;, &quot;Valerius&quot;, &quot;Belisarius&quot; and &quot;Portius&quot; wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington&#39;s decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people as part of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions have been gathered in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
However, he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation are at the very core of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, they consume more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
They move most often in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holiday, on the one hand, they have more time to browse the web, and under the umbrella, they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
That&#39;s according to recent O2 statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available as part of a flat rate than at home.
It is therefore not surprising that in Croatia, where a minimum of locals go during the winter, data consumption has even increased fivefold in this summer season.
Italy then came in second in the ranking of data consumed.
The Czechs call most of the minutes from Germany, where many of them go on work even during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, 800,000 Czechs visit Croatia every year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year&#39;s record was July 7.
&quot;The transferred data would fit tens of millions of photos,&quot; said Silvia Cieslarová, director of the mobile segment at O2.
Although Croatia leads in the volume of data, the highest number of Czech users is in neighboring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have much time to browse the Internet.
&quot;In addition, the Czechs are heading to the Adriatic via Austria,&quot; Cieslarová explained.
While the operator recorded high year-on-year growth in data after the release of roaming charges, growth in telephony is much lower.
The number of minutes called while roaming has doubled compared to last year.
Germany dominates with a huge lead over other countries.
&quot;Roaming calls are used more by corporate customers on business trips,&quot; added Cieslarová.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a homely atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Former golf number one Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, Scotland, which is hosting the 25th Scottish Senior Open for the next three days.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, lost to Paul Eales last year at the nearby Archerfield Links Golf Course on his way to the finals. This year, he will act as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club&#39;s founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
&quot;I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year&#39;s tournament will show the world its beauty,&quot; said Rafferty.
&quot;Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year&#39;s tournament is in the right hands. &quot;
Englishman Eales will defend his championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
&quot;I feel good about it,&quot; said the Southport golfer.
&quot;I did not have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open, because a year after my victory, the tournament was canceled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It is a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year, when for me and my wife Sharon, winning really meant a lot.
These were beautiful times that I will not forget. &quot;
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region this year, is returning to home soil.
This event will be his first participation since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
&quot;I always like to play at home,&quot; Orr said of Helensburgh.
&quot;You want to succeed and at the same time you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I&#39;m doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far. &quot;
Former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will also join the trio on the field.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. Parking is £ 5 for a car with one passenger and £ 10 for a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and death in the Indonesian land of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the local language &quot;note&quot; - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he removes the potatoes and enjoys it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not furnished - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes in the turbid water of a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof replaces the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband&#39;s four wives, she was not assigned any fields to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late into the night is a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers live in the village.
&quot;In the afternoon after five o&#39;clock, no one will dare to wander around the village,&quot; says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by raising their hands publicly in front of the occupying army.
The current movement to protest Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and devastated city, which you can reach after a ninety minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach grip.
Public transport is not working at this location.
The city with 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners visited the place.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that&#39;s not all.
&quot;We weren&#39;t used to wearing these dresses,&quot; says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt, and radiant skirt.
&quot;We used to wear only leaves.&quot;
Papua is Indonesia&#39;s poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, however, it is the Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoeenix, is located just 60 miles from Pania, a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, home to about 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $ 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports logging worth an estimated $ 78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation by the New York Times in 2005 found that Freeport paid about $ 20 million to local military officials and troops between 1998 and 2004, including $ 150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely repressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
The massacres in the Papua tribal region during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane in 2016, describes the atrocities that took place last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - another rape and electric execution are particularly popular - and the brutal repression of peaceful protesters.
&quot;It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents occur every week,&quot; said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources are attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province&#39;s 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% profess Christianity, but demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
&quot;Immigrants have started selling chickens and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,&quot; explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Pania and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura.
&quot;The original inhabitants of Papua - mama-mama (women) - thus lost their jobs.&quot;
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and human rights abuses in his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and made his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta on 27 of Papua&#39;s 29 districts, including Pania.
But very little has changed in Papua and the locals feel betrayed.
&quot;Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokpwi in 2014, hoping to hear our call for justice,&quot; You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi&#39;s inauguration in October, Pania experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs by a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers emerged on motorcycles from the gloom of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this rebuke and the tone with which it was uttered, and later returned with four other soldiers, said local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the drunk soldiers chased a group of children and beat them with the butt of their weapons, citing victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election commission building, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters to demand justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - in which they run in a circle and imitate the singing of birds - of the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at the buildings.
With escalating tensions, soldiers were ordered over the radio: &quot;If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to shoot,&quot; the official documentary, the contents of which was never published in the local media, was reported by TIME.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the impending danger and called on residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one cared about his words.
&quot;When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,&quot; he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn&#39;t know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
&quot;There were a lot of people all around and there was a lot of shooting,&quot; he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
&quot;I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,&quot; Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME in a grim voice.
&quot;I saw he was dead ... I kissed him.&quot;
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only &quot;securing&quot; the station that was under attack.
&quot;We must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us,&quot; said Papuan police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
&quot;It&#39;s a matter of life and death.&quot;
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped with injuries.
The news of the murders was rumored by the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, he gave a passionate speech to Jokow in Jayapura, expressing his understanding for the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
&quot;I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again,&quot; he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would set up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve past acts of violence.
But almost immediately, excuses began.
&quot;Most acts of violence have taken place a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task, &quot;he said.
However, in an interview on June 5 for the weekly TIME, which took place in Jakarta, Wiranto stated that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, &quot;all cases will be brought to court.&quot;
Wiranto, accused by the UN of &quot;crimes against humanity&quot; with more than one thousand deaths in the 1999 independent elections in East Timor - said 11 human rights violations in Papua had been settled so far, including the Pania incident.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Pania welcomed his claim with distrust.
&quot;I&#39;ve been interviewed a total of four times in the last three years, but I haven&#39;t seen anything yet,&quot; Yohanes said.
&quot;I am tired.&quot;
As he says, he still lives in fear a few years later.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid,&quot; he says.
&quot;I&#39;m afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me.&quot;
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Pania residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
&quot;After the burial of the bodies, the army began to look for me,&quot; he said.
And the shooting still doesn&#39;t stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The clash, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, took place between the villagers and the manager of a construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting an unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the members and the answer was a warning shot.
However, locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitarist police) started firing at the crowd and killed one person.
&quot;There was panic, we were afraid of revenge,&quot; Domingo Badia, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured, told TIME.
&quot;I didn&#39;t leave the house for two days.&quot;
The Deiya parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only exacerbates the separation of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal indigenous peoples who live in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an rebel army that protects Papuan rights by attacking and abducting Indonesian police.
Some of the PDT leaders come from Pania. These include Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Pania residents in recent years, all on the pretext of &quot;securing national sovereignty.&quot;
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as a &quot;tragic and forgotten place&quot;.
Poverty adds oil to the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is just as unattainable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each cultivates four or five sweet potato fields.
Most of the harvest is for the needs of the family, the rest are sold at the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants has increased.
So few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education they need to start a business.
&quot;Young people are moving out of the villages due to a lack of job opportunities and money,&quot; said John Gobai, chairman of the Pania tribal council.
Due to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua earlier this year for &quot;lack of cooperation with the authorities&quot;, all despite the fact that they received such rare permission to film.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokow the abolition of strict rules for journalists and the achievement of transparency and development. But that never happened.
&quot;Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: visa refusal and blacklisting,&quot; he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesians in the Papua case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot;various and widespread acts of violence&quot; in Papua, including the shooting in Pania.
These countries have also supported PDT in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook off the accusations when he told reporters in Jakarta that &quot;Indonesia has a democratic system and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights abuses.&quot;
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, locals shouted the slogan &quot;We want freedom&quot;, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Another election is scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
&quot;Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Pania,&quot; said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know that the people of Pania - in addition to living in constant fear of a marauding army - are wallowing in poverty, poor education and health care.
Gobai claims that the people of Pania, like other Papuans, consider their vote to be a &quot;debt&quot; to be paid to Jokai.
&quot;They don&#39;t want money, they want justice,&quot; he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims of the Panamanian shooting, they continue the last symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on land opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least he will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
&quot;A member of our family was killed,&quot; Yacobus said, his head bowed.
&quot;What can we do?&quot;
The French navy intercepted a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French navy detained a yacht carrying 1.46 tonnes of cocaine worth about $ 256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment went to Australia.
During the intervention, a four-member crew of the ship was arrested, which probably consists of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was dragged by police to the port of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to pinpoint where and where the drugs were coming from and to uncover the &quot;Lithuanian syndicate&quot;.
&quot;We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures taken to stop large quantities of drugs destined for Australia,&quot; said Col Blanch, the CEO.
The drugs were destroyed in Nouméa this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for smugglers due to high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first lately.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, they need to be reminded to drink.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, according to Pavla Mádlová, a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague, infusion of saline solution, which is injected with a thin needle under the skin, could be the solution.
However, so far they are applied only in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
&quot;In addition, they lose the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take in less fluids and dehydrate very quickly,&quot; said Madlova.
Two liters should be drunk for sure.
&quot;But getting so much fluid into an old man is a big problem,&quot; she added.
According to her, no doctor often watches in homes for the elderly.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated by infusion.
&quot;I think they should be gradually introduced there as well, so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions,&quot; she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of saline can be delivered to the elderly per day.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headaches and reduced performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
&quot;One day the old man says he can&#39;t get out of bed, he&#39;s talking confused,&quot; she added.
Failure to do so can result in a stroke.
The blood thickens and clogs a blood vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, preferably with a cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
&quot;It is more nursingly demanding, but it would be ideal to uncover the patient from time to time and let the skin ventilate,&quot; the doctor said.
The Torch skyscraper burned for the second time in Dubai
One of the world&#39;s largest residential skyscrapers was on fire in Dubai on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high and 79-story building.
This is the second fire of this high-rise building in the last two years, which bears the apt name The Torch.
All occupants of the building were evacuated and no injuries occurred. The cause of the fire is unknown.
&quot;We were asleep and we were awakened by an alarm. We heard screams.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor, &quot;Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
The Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters were able to bring the fire under control around 4 a.m. (0:00 GMT), after which they continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they provide alternative accommodation for the affected population.
The incident could again spark a debate about the safety of materials used to line high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation launched by the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 showed that the lining and external panels used for decoration or insulation were the most damaged.
British police said the insulation and lining system of London&#39;s Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, which killed almost 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers to the USA carry prohibited articles on board the aircraft
A survey of passengers found that more than twenty percent of them knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited articles through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoint aboard the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded an aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they found out late that they were traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
From a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and to which more than 1000 respondents answered - younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to travel with an object that is banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand flying hours, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that have escaped the TSA&#39;s attention are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents deliberately uttered a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of men surveyed also admitted that they had deliberately brought illicit drugs on board an aircraft.
The company said it was conducting research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally dropped unauthorized items through airport checks and how many did so on purpose.
Not surprisingly, most people who have carried unauthorized items - either consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company has pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids and how much they can carry on a plane.
Not surprisingly, the TSA confiscated the largest amount of banned fluids.
For a while, people thought that the TSA would treat books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Carriage of liquids is permitted on domestic flights, not international ones.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on postponing Obama administration&#39;s planned guidelines to reduce emissions
After 15 years have been sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, its head, Scott Pruitt, revoked his earlier decision to postpone the former Obama administration&#39;s plan to reduce carbon emissions.
Pruitt introduced the changes to his plan. It thus responds more rapidly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal appeal filed against his previous position with the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the deadline, which was set for 1 October, when states should start implementing the 2015 regulation to reduce ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the agreement for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid &quot;intervention with local decisions or impending economic growth.&quot;
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma&#39;s state attorney general before being appointed EPA chief president Donald Trump, has long served as a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly shifted or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden turnaround on Wednesday is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt&#39;s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that an EPA executor had exceeded his authority in a bid to delay the incorporation of the Obama administration&#39;s plan to require oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt drafted its version of ozone standards and strengthened EPA&#39;s commitment to working with nations through comprehensive processes and compliance with new standards within a timeframe.
&quot;Under the previous EPA administration, it often failed to meet deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to a settlement and further setting of plans,&quot; said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA.
&quot;We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it. &quot;
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may, at some point, use &quot;the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities&quot; to ensure that regulations &quot;are based on sound policy and the most available information.&quot;
Republicans are pushing for more extensive rewriting of ozone rules in Congress.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measures have still not passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow it under legal pressure.
&quot;The reversal in EPA&#39;s views - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution,&quot; Schneiderman added.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, DC have joined New York.
Ground-level ozone is formed when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists appreciate Pruitt&#39;s sudden change.
&quot;It&#39;s worrying about the pressure we need to put on changing the minds of those responsible and protecting the air we breathe,&quot; said Lori Ann Burd of the Biodiversity Center.
&quot;We must continue to contend with the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, which seeks to help polluters and special interests.&quot;
He poured acid on the man, but according to the court he is not dangerous.
You never know what might happen to you.
At one moment you&#39;re at home with your family and laughing, at another, your whole life suddenly changes from the ground up.
And the worst part is that there&#39;s nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was burned with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
The information was provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on Christopheros&#39; door.
Andreas got up to go open it.
He thought there was probably a courier outside the door to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
A man he had never seen in his life poured acid on him right after opening without warning, saying, &quot;This is for you, my friend.&quot;
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart like nothing and I only felt an incredible pain in my skin, &quot;said Andreas.
His family quickly took him to the hospital, but there his loved ones heard the terrible news - according to the doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
For weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent affected the face that doctors were trying to put together using skin from other parts of the patient&#39;s body.
The loss of eyelids has become a major complication for Christopher.
It&#39;s probably the most torturous thing I&#39;ve ever experienced.
&quot;You can&#39;t hide from unexpected light, you can&#39;t close your eyes,&quot; he described his anguish.
Today, Christopheros has undergone twelve operations, far from being the last.
According to plastic surgeons, injuries suffered by victims of acid attacks can require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
&quot;Sometimes people don&#39;t recover and fight deformity and deformity all their lives,&quot; said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man must have confused him with someone.
The perpetrator believed that he was taking revenge on a man who had sexually abused his loved one.
The police properly investigated the case and later tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the amazement of Christopher&#39;s family changed fundamentally.
&quot;Three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be overturned because the man is not considered a threat to the public,&quot; Christopheros said.
The number of corrosive attacks has increased significantly over the last few years.
The local Ministry of the Interior commented on the issue by planning new guidelines for prosecutors regarding the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of such attacks do not intend to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for stricter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different shops because they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night.
According to Dubai Civil Defense, the occupants of the 80-story building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for the Dubai police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the opposite.
&quot;It started on the 67th floor, that&#39;s what they told us,&quot; said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread downward with falling hot debris.
We were sleeping.
An alarm woke us up, people were shouting.
&quot;We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor,&quot; tenant George described the events.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames engulfed about 40 apartments.
A fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when burning parts of the building hit them.
After about two hours, according to the civil defense, the fire was brought under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, there was a power outage in the surrounding buildings.
A large fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then, nothing happened to anyone, because the inhabitants were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and at that time became the tallest residential building in the world with its 352 meters.
Another Dubai skyscraper set him a record the very next year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He still didn&#39;t win.
According to Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolita had a diverse collection of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson&#39;s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now a bodybuilder faces four years in distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record number of athletes caught until then.
According to him, the three-league player started taking steroids the year before, when he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She hugged passionately with her ex-boyfriend!
As soon as Lucka Vondráčková entered the territory of the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also attracts attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell into her arms was her ex-boyfriend Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older at the time and already longed for a family.
Lucia was only 19 at the time and certainly did not want to nail her career.
So they went apart, but have remained friends to this day.
Which they also did at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both matched the blue color.
At first they ignored themselves, but then they became closer, and Lucie laughed at Michal&#39;s jokes as she grabbed her stomach.
Then they hugged and posed willingly for the photographers.
However, their meeting was not a coincidence, as they will play a loving couple together in the new Prima series Captain Exner.
Islamists have been sentenced to life in Britain for plotting to assassinate.
A British court on Thursday sent four members of an Islamist cell called the Three Musketeers to life in prison and, according to the prosecutor&#39;s office, was planning a terrorist attack against police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar offenses, were arrested last August.
At the time, the authorities thought he was going to attack immediately.
In one of the men&#39;s cars, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean &quot;unbelievers&quot; in Arabic, and a model of a pistol.
It happened at a time when an MI5 secret service agent was placing a listening device in the car.
&quot;Recent assassinations have shown how horrible the defendants could have been if they had not been stopped,&quot; said Prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for release after 20 years.
A fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car had been placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants&#39; allegations.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 ° C in the Hodonín region.
Tuesday&#39;s temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at its peak for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region, it was surpassed by Thursday, which has become the warmest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Compared to Tuesday, however, many temperature records did not fall on Thursday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or leveled at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Strážnice, Thursday&#39;s temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region, Thursday&#39;s 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
It was ten degrees less in the west.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the greatest heat was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, Thursday&#39;s highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
&quot;Temperatures there started to rise only later in the afternoon,&quot; meteorologists said.
According to the CHMI, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and heavier rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to use its influence without the use of force.
It spends $ 10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is failing.
The local state media talks about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic change and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, the situation in the world&#39;s most populous country is assessed by Christopher Balding, an economics professor at the University of Beijing, in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is China&#39;s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, and the citizens of the others have to obtain a visa in advance.
At the Chinese authorities in the USA, therefore, the crowds are comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $ 140, but if you don&#39;t want to wait long hours in line, you have to pay $ 100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces a country&#39;s number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans visited Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China&#39;s gross domestic product and less than one percent of the population.
China often exacerbates this problem when using tourism to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift over South Korea&#39;s anti-missile system, South Koreans repaid it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year on year, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the US Federal Reserve, China could leave as much as $ 190 billion as a result of Chinese travel abroad, while China earns about $ 35 billion a year to sell currency to incoming tourists.
According to official balance of payments figures, China had a $ 217 billion tourism deficit last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China&#39;s total trade surplus in goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists deal a very painful blow to a country that anxiously prevents the outflow of capital.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, less than a million foreigners lived in China.
Some individual cities in the United States have more.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific studies show that immigrants tend to boost economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
However, you can hardly find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being offered is visa facilitation.
Other Asian countries, notably India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce the cost of visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
Deadly poisonous reptiles were bred in the Pilsen Zoo.
The Pilsen Kingdom of Poison can enjoy the young of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
So far, visitors will see only all nine newborn Turkish vipers in the exhibition.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
&quot;It grows to a meter long,&quot; said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The young of the other two species, the dead and the cobra, will gain strength in the breeding background of the garden.
We still can&#39;t tell when people will see them.
&quot;We would not like to lose them,&quot; said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian mortal vipers were born, they are descendants of a breeding pair originating from a population around Sydney.
&quot;The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the Death Eaters from the Perth area,&quot; Vobruba said, adding that in human care, the Death Eaters need to hibernate for 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
One hundred percent success was accompanied by a clutch of African spitting red cobras.
The pair in the Pilsen Zoo hatched from four eggs a total of four chicks.
&quot;The incubation lasted 65 days,&quot; Vobruba added.
This species in the wild sprays poison on its victims, up to a distance of four meters.
It goes to the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on mouse holats in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden, the young are still hatching from the clutch of black mamba, the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the telephone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The US Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump&#39;s phone calls with leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone conversation on January 27 with Mexican President Enrique Peña Niet, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US president blamed him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, &quot;You can&#39;t talk like that in the press.&quot;
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US surveillance agreement on refugees to Australia was &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;stupid,&quot; and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama - he would look &quot;drugged&quot; afterwards. , which proposed a ban on refugees from entering the United States.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that &quot;this is my most unpleasant call of the day.&quot;
Tusk testified again at the prosecutor&#39;s office about Smolensk.
&quot;He has something to be afraid of,&quot; said Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the brother of the dead president, chairman of the PiS law and justice party, to Tusk&#39;s address.
&quot;I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me,&quot; Tusk replied, rebuking the country&#39;s current leadership for trying to abuse the judiciary against political opponents.
When leaving the prosecutor&#39;s office, a crowd chanting Donald Tusk was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24! and wished the politician a hundred years !.
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him of a clear conscience: &quot;I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me.&quot;
According to him, he does not blame prosecutors, but he does not doubt that the judiciary should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, the opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid I belong to this group.
He was at the interrogation for the second time.
The ex-prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor&#39;s office for the second time, this time the interrogation was to concern mistakes in the autopsies of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
Additionally, the bodies in the coffins were exchanged.
Families were forbidden to open coffins and there had to be reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
&quot;Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was intended to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU,&quot; Kaczyński told Trwam Catholic television.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would frustrate Tusk&#39;s chances of gaining the most important seat in the union, of which, of course, Poland has absolutely nothing to do.
Kaczyński also said that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it might turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but did not take note of it.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor&#39;s office on April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many saw his summons to be questioned as part of an apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by associating with various scandals.
The Prosecutor&#39;s Office in Poland reports to the Minister of Justice, who acts as Attorney General.
The summons to the hearing came shortly after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, whom Kaczyński tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel&#39;s visit to Warsaw.
In the end, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone at the EU summit against the extension of Tusk&#39;s term.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the House of Commons from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its embassies since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
This follows from the decree, which regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update, it is currently in the comment procedure.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens elected members abroad.
&quot;Since the last amendment to the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists,&quot; the ministry justifies its action.
&quot;In some countries, new embassies have been created, some embassies have been closed, or the level of representation has changed,&quot; the material said.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the embassies to which paper ballot papers are delivered.
This group of authorities includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighboring countries, ie Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
Another more than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a press release ballot.
It is their list that changes with the decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czechia also canceled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia and Kyoto, Japan.
He will not be elected at the consulate general in Donetsk either.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, the Senegalese capital Dakar and Zambia&#39;s Lusaka.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czechia has expanded its representation to include the Consulate General in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of China&#39;s Sichuan Province.
Ballot papers will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose deputies in polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the state election commission shall determine by lot the region for which the candidates are voting abroad.
It was the first time in 2002, when decisions were made among South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to the vote, in 2006 there were about 6700, four years later 8222.
To the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters went to the embassies.
Moore&#39;s Ford Massacre: Activists recalled racist lynching
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove by bystanders of Monroe, Georgia, and headed for the Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked his path.
The group&#39;s leader - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - drew a long cigarette and stared at the car windshield.
Inside, the passengers were shaking with fear.
&quot;We want n --- and Roger!&quot; The man shouted.
&quot;Bring him to me!&quot;
The silence is broken by the roar of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of the events that took place on 22 July.
But when one of the men throws a noose over &quot;Roger&#39;s&quot; neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge regularly to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has been tried for murder yet.
&quot;Surprisingly, not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities, ”said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the reconstruction of the event.
&quot;It&#39;s a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.&quot;
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to action. Every year, it reminds the community of the city of Monroe that not enough justice has been done.
&quot;We demand prosecution and closure, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first and foremost,&quot; Brooks said.
&quot;Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin.&quot;
On July 27, 1946, a medical examiner covers one of the bodies of lynching victims at Moore&#39;s Ford.
According to FBI files obtained from NBC News, the lynching was to be attended by up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts.
However, no one has been prosecuted yet.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights activists claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, by decision of the Supreme Court, black residents of Georgia won the right to participate in elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
And it was during the summer election that, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom was supposed to stab white landowner Barnett Hester during a skirmish - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, it was said in the city that Hester had an affair with Malcom&#39;s wife, Dorothy, and brought her to another state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, then a prominent white landowner, paid $ 600 bail for Malcom.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from prison, just before entering Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
&quot;As it turned out, Harrison planned and organized the murders,&quot; the FBI said.
&quot;It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local lawyers, who not only participated in the lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.&quot;
Brooks spoke more succinctly.
&quot;It was a massacre for the right to vote,&quot; he said.
&quot;The murders had a clear undertone for all black locals: &#39;This is how you end up if you register and go to the polls.&#39;&quot;
Cassandra Greene has been organizing the annual reenactment of the Moore&#39;s Ford Bridge event for nearly a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and concise. It shows a deep-rooted racism that many would like to see extinct in modern America.
Following this reconstruction is not easy and even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
&quot;Nobody wants to talk about lynching, because we have to deal with the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us,&quot; Greene said.
&quot;But there can be no relationship between us unless you listen to what I had to go through.&quot;
The main rehearsals for this year&#39;s rehearsal began in June, and on the very first day, about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - flocked to a room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh serves as an assistant director.
He played the leader of the Kukluxklan for many years, but he said the role was exhausting.
&quot;I feel bad about it because it&#39;s against who I am,&quot; Marbaugh said.
&quot;I think it&#39;s very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time.&quot;
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, hence Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a skirmish - Malcom argues with Hester and accuses him of sleeping with his wife.
&quot;Get off my property n --- e!&quot;
Rascona can&#39;t.
There is a skirmish.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) bursts out laughing.
Greene laughs the most.
&quot;What happened?&quot; Rascona asks.
He&#39;s confused.
Was I too rude?
&quot;No,&quot; Greene said cheerfully.
&quot;I just don&#39;t think white people said &#39;n-r&#39; in that tone at the time.&quot;
&quot;Exactly,&quot; said one of the black actors.
&quot;You need to put more emphasis on R.&quot;
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. Just to be done for enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word on N.
Nobody laughs now.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Roar, shots ... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the actors&#39; bodies and sings Billie Holiday&#39;s mournful song &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;.
There is sadness in the room with every word.
Against the background of all this, about a dozen onlookers wipe the sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, and many bystanders were from nearby locations.
Each endures the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in crowds to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up to this point, the murders could have been viewed from a distance, but now, standing in the same spot where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is haunting.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites a crowd of spectators to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel at the victims&#39; heads, watch for fake blood and still bodies, and whisper something in their ears.
&quot;They&#39;re not dead,&quot; says the little boy.
A few minutes pass and Greene thanks the audience. It&#39;s end.
The actors clean the rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, a man in a suit played by the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two actor friends and cries in their arms; in the end, emotions hit him.
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; one of the women whispers.
&quot;We know you don&#39;t like the role.
But you had a reason for that. &quot;
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young Caucasian couple talks with interest about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could barely find the words to express her sense of today&#39;s performance.
&quot;It&#39;s hard to listen to those ugly words and look at the ugly deeds ... of people who look like you and do it because they look like you,&quot; she said of the reconstruction.
&quot;It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical issue,&quot; she added, &quot;it&#39;s just called a police fight.&quot;
Across the room is Tyrone Brooks in the courtroom. He enjoys dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning a performance for next year.
&quot;Reconstructing these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it&#39;s also a moment to think about,&quot; he said.
&quot;If we don&#39;t learn from who knows ... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it. &quot;
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that only srab reads the instructions for use.
I do not agree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern art forms, often pure surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia the times long past, where the instructions for using anything were a rather rare phenomenon.
For example, my first turntable contained only one piece of paper, on which were hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some components, all of which had some secret marks.
When something went wrong after years, I offered the document to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back plate.
He advised me with a smirk, what that paper with a labyrinth of lines is suitable for.
Yes, it was a common aid in chronic toilet paper depletion.
He playfully found the disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to the expensive vinyl pancakes again.
The new era has brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply held on to a sliced grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
Particularly successful was the sketch describing how to slide one part into another.
The set was two-part and no other procedure was possible.
Putting it on the contrary required considerable effort, with the need to break off certain plastic parts.
My contempt for the instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-propelled.
The year of production 2003 still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the turn signal light bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work was to be completed.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual failed to state that while the bulb on the right could be replaced in really only three steps.
1. remove the cover.
2. unscrew the cracked bulb and screw in a new one.
3. Slide the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem with the location of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the bowels of the car, I would find a spring, a screw that easily removed the cover, and then I would follow points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
Footbridge error.
The cover had no place, no room, even for Cinderella&#39;s slender hand, let alone an obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, without any success.
The condition was exacerbated by my wife&#39;s entrance into the garage, which was summoned by a roar and words he heard very rarely from my mouth.
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; she asked innocently.
My answer took about 90 seconds, but if I omit the vulgar terms, there were only two publishable words left.
I&#39;m changing a light bulb.
&quot;And why does it take you so long?&quot; she risked a sentence that may be her last in a long-running volume.
I slowly explained the problem to her, focusing on the procedure of the author&#39;s torture, where the hot iron blessing on the hand that wrote the instructions, then her childhood so that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to the wide range of Witch&#39;s Hammer instructions. including his commissioned burning on the hill above Losinský chateau.
&quot;How about removing the box?&quot; meant woman removing battery.
In sheer despair, this happened, and then steps 1-3 were as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
Until the day when a colleague called me, who was just recovering from a collapse situation after the inspection of two officials of the State Department for Drug Control.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can tell even wild stories in an unemotional voice.
&quot;Imagine I was fined for not having my hand washing instructions posted,&quot; he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I got out of the whole problem, which was that above the sink in the patient&#39;s toilet does not have a pictorial instruction on how to wash your hands.
His argument to the commission official that adults can usually wash their hands and that pictograms are not needed to handle the habit of decent people did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
&quot;It&#39;s not just that,&quot; she told him.
He understood that simply rinsing soapy palms with running water was a primitive act at the level of the Cro-Magnon that the modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
Thus, it is necessary to state that it is necessary to turn off the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is a joyful finding that a person washed his hands exactly as instructed by the hosudar from SÚKL.
Finally, I must point out that I was inspired and I prepare a detailed plan for activities in the toilet.
On the issue of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, with urination, due to certain differences between the sexes, it will be necessary to post two instructions.
The pictograms remain a problem, because creating a perfect procedure also means an accurate drawing of all anatomical details, which could arouse a certain outrage in a prudential visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he may finally learn that he wiped the hole throughout his life with a completely wrong procedure. .
Pearson will lay off another 3,000 people and cut dividends in a bid to revive business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it would lay off another 3,000 employees and reduce the interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, follows a previous decision by the company to lay off 4,000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further £ 300 million ($ 394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program to resurrect declining business as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month approved the sale of its stake in Bertelsmann&#39;s Penguin Random House, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a 1% increase in base sales in the first half of the year to £ 2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO troops were killed in a suicide blast
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were injured, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to a NATO statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the attack in Qarabagh Borough.
A bomb attack hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
A suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul on Monday.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday&#39;s explosion came after a patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a &quot;local person with a home-made explosive device.&quot;
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of life and are in a US military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a major source of concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul&#39;s Shia district.
The Taliban joined the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people. It is the deadliest militant attack in the country since US troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence undermines the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops who should help troops and police in the country.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks, which he has seen in recent weeks, have shaken public confidence in the government, its orders and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
In response to the lawsuit, EPA reconsidered its decision to delay smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed its decision to postpone the Obama administration&#39;s law ordering states to reduce emissions just a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
On Wednesday night, EPA announced its decision to forward the &quot;Ozone Standards 2015&quot;, saying it was presenting the agency&#39;s commitment to work with states.
&quot;We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will hear their views,&quot; said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA&#39;s efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and use limits to set limits that must be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of most Democracies, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday alleging that EPA conduct was illegal.
President Donald Trump&#39;s administration seeks to prevent many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump - in an effort to kick-start economic growth.
However, the new government&#39;s efforts have launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups, who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing ozone-containing air &quot;can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,&quot; such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár was hit and blood flowed!
You may have already registered this relatively new singer with us in June of this year, when this hitherto almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event in Czech conditions, which hosted such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not moderated by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show the public and present your music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was performed by the newly named personalities.
But few people already know that the actual shooting of the video clip, which took place in Russia, did not go without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big recording with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and it did not go without a big mess.
Sara&#39;s song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer&#39;s juice was supposed to indicate a slap in the video.
At one point, however, he struck him so hard and right in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
&quot;It was a blow, I didn&#39;t expect it, blood immediately started running from my nose,&quot; Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers told each other the situation on the set that it was an unfortunate coincidence and Ladislav did not have time to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious as to affect the continuation of the next shoot.
We are now bringing you the mentioned video clip of a young artist, you can also record that scene with a punch in it.
The unsuccessful version with blood, however, was rather not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at Tuesday&#39;s meeting.
Each was in a separate room in ESPN&#39;s Los Angeles offices until Garcia - the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion - went downstairs to the lobby, where he welcomed Lomacenka, the World Boxing Organization&#39;s springweight champion.
After Garcia&#39;s unanimous victory against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday&#39;s Showtime match, both boxers made it to the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, &quot;How are you, champ?
Good luck.&quot;
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and Lomačenka manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential duel of boxers would be a &quot;perfect test&quot;.
&quot;I&#39;m a former spring weight champion,&quot; adds Garcia.
&quot;Because of the match with Broner (67 kg) I had to gain weight, but I&#39;m not that big.
I&#39;m small at my 63 kg.
I would like to return to the lightweight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight again to get light ... then we can fight.
This is what fans want.
Why not meet them. &quot;
Lomachenko agrees.
&quot;Boxing would benefit from this match.&quot;
Klimas has called for pay-per-view - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko is set to make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and face Garcia next year (37-0, 30 knockouts), who has also expressed interest in the match against duel winner Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the lightweight title on September 23 at the Forum Arena.
&quot;The match should take place in a pay-per-view style, the fans demand,&quot; said Garcia, who later said he was open to broadcasting the match through the television station that came up with the best deal.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw such attention to themselves.
We will wait for the right opportunity ... &quot;
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as an &quot;amazing boxer&quot; and could take part in his match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was not lulled by Garcia&#39;s praise when he said the Riverside three-division champion looked &quot;very slow ... sorry Mike, but you&#39;re talking about a knockout.&quot;
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt rising tension before the duel.
&quot;You just won&#39;t forget this match.
No other match attracts so much attention.
And I will be very happy to put it on the fire, &quot;Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey.&quot;
It will be a great match. &quot;
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
They now found their car at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians, Ilya Zirnov and Kira Cherkasova, have been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search was launched on them, but without success.
And the police eventually closed the investigation for lack of evidence.
The lost couple&#39;s families lived in the uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad end of the whole story came.
The wreck of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the city of Cheboksary in Chuvashia.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car did the police manage to identify the couple.
The documents have survived for a decade underwater, without which it would take police much longer to identify the found.
The couple was last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father so that he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his finding to the Cheboksar police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the young couple&#39;s death was an accident caused by a frozen road around the river.
However, the investigation continues, after which further details will be published.
Recent test results to determine the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results from asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people were surveyed as older than 18, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started conducting new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases for investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests performed between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medical Agency judged the respondent to be &quot;possibly over 18 years of age.&quot;
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent was &quot;perhaps under the age of 18&quot;.
Tests are taken only if the age of the interviewee is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
&quot;Compared to last month, the statistics are on track and the numbers are very similar,&quot; he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, stating that in 442 cases it was found that &quot;the respondent is 18 years of age or older&quot;.
Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent stated that he would be 18 this year.
The medical method of determining age has also been criticized, which includes an X-ray of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of the knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and radiologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which, among other things, deals with the assessment of people&#39;s biological maturity to determine the age at which they have gone through puberty.
&quot;I had reason to think about this issue and I don&#39;t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is in a sense very uncertain.
If we cannot determine the age with accuracy, we should not pretend otherwise, &quot;he told Metro newspaper.
Agency&#39;s GÃ¶ransson, the forensic medical agency, defended the decision by saying: “In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The highest risk is the fact that the interviewee is just below the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents. &quot;
Trump threatened the president of Mexico over the phone.
In a January phone call to US President Enrique Peň Niet, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet with him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for the construction of the wall between the USA and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would be arranged somehow, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump spoke similarly openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This follows from transcripts of interviews published by the American daily The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president, shortly after taking office as Trump, Peña Nieta scolded undiplomatically for criticizing his plan to build the wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
&quot;You can&#39;t tell this to the press,&quot; Trump said repeatedly in an January 27 interview, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continued to make defiant statements.
It is said that the financing will be invented somehow, and in the end it will turn out well.
&quot;But if you say that Mexico will not pay for the wall, then I no longer want to associate with you gentlemen, because that is unacceptable to me,&quot; he said, according to the American daily Trump.
He described the wall as the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it is perhaps the most important.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after taking power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of a 3,200-kilometer wall, which has strained relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump&#39;s telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
He was drawn to such a conclusion by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States receiving people from internment facilities in the Pacific island states.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later agreed to it.
&quot;I&#39;m sure you can say that this is not an agreement you made, but you will have to stick to it,&quot; Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised Australia&#39;s refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
&quot;You&#39;re worse than me,&quot; Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation sharpened.
&quot;I hate accepting these people,&quot; Trump said.
I assure you they are bad.
That&#39;s why they&#39;re in jail now.
&quot;They won&#39;t be great people who go to work for local dairies,&quot; he said.
He also noted in an interview that a refugee could become an assassin from Boston in five years.
At the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, Trump had telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often several in one day.
He finally described the conversation with Turnbull as the least pleasant of the day.
Before concluding it, he emphasized that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In front of the crowd, they killed the killer Rana.
Her father also watched.
The execution took place on a square in the Yemeni capital Sana&#39;a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi abducted the girl, took her to his father&#39;s house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He subsequently raped her body, which he then threw near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl hit the whole country, which is facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed crowd who had gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim&#39;s father reported his feelings to the media after the execution.
I feel a new person.
I felt relieved.
It&#39;s a new day of my life.
The other members of the family were also present, shouting the slogan &quot;Long live justice&quot; together with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van, from which he was dragged.
The police placed him tied to his stomach.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and opened fire in the immediate vicinity.
The crowd present celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice had been done in accordance with the country&#39;s legal system.
&quot;Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won,&quot; he added.
I was standing in Liberation Square in Sanae waiting for the execution of my daughter&#39;s killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ranina&#39;s little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife, Jamileh, and I are grateful that justice has been done.
Police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would succumb to the hatred of madness, grab the killer and lynch.
The execution was ordered by a court administered by the Shiite Hutis.
Originally, the Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his act provoked such outrage that the judge opted for the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl&#39;s disappearance on June 27.
Rana&#39;s family knew him well.
As police searched the basement of his house, they found evidence that the man was planning his action.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to Rana.
&quot;Our family has no enemies and the injuries borne by Rana&#39;s body were terrible,&quot; he told the media.
&quot;The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo hung everywhere,&quot; he continued.
Everyone believes that the police received a tip from the murderer&#39;s parents, who suspected their son of a horrific act.
The girl&#39;s mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter&#39;s body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other children in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
Disgusted by the crime, the people of Yemen began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was being held, demanding immediate punishment.
A Justice Department official read the record of the investigation to reassure them.
The accused did not seem to be sorry for his actions.
Just before serving his sentence, the police read him the verdict, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings on the Internet made by the crowd.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of political party
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at a President Trump meeting Thursday that he was moving to another party.
&quot;Like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me,&quot; Governor Justice said.
&quot;Today, after much prayer and reflection, I am announcing to you ... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I am telling you that I can no longer support you as a Democratic governor.&quot;
A crowd of onlookers exploded in joy.
&quot;I&#39;ll join the Republicans tomorrow,&quot; Justice added.
&quot;As a coach, I can tell you it&#39;s time to jump into another match.&quot;
Trump had previously promised the West Virginia assembly an important announcement.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the whole country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $ 1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, issued a statement on Thursday night saying, &quot;The defection of Governor Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of helping to lift our country.&quot;
&quot;For a Democratic party with only 15 governors and the least legislators in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is the last straw for an already miserable party without a leader trying in vain to find a positive and unifying message,&quot; RNC President Ronna McDanil said in a statement. statement for CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia&#39;s &quot;sincere&quot; apology for the doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the sports world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that his country&#39;s expulsion from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to &quot;all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way.&quot;
Despite his comments, IAAF members voted to maintain the ban, which came into force in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
&quot;I think we have seen a very honest response and presentation today,&quot; IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
&quot;All members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and was working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire federation.&quot;
Coe said he was also &quot;pleased&quot; that Russia had adopted criteria for its reintroduction.
&quot;I think today has been very successful and we have moved to the next level, but Congress supports the Crisis Staff&#39;s recommendation to maintain the sentence imposed on Russia,&quot; Coe added.
&quot;In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
&quot;Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest ones,&quot; he concluded.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begins on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the strict rules of the IAAF will compete under a neutral flag.
IAAF Crisis Chief of Staff Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
Drug tests are still unsatisfactory and excluded coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after a presentation by the IAAF.
The state contract of CzechTrade was won by the company of František Savov, whose state is being prosecuted.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the Mladá fronta František Savova publishing house.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
At the same time, they did not mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade announced a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract in the total value of 30.8 million crowns was won by the Mladá fronta publishing house of the entrepreneur František Savov.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are prosecuting him on the run.
Savov fled to Great Britain and the Czechia is asking for his extradition.
The Aktuálně.cz server drew attention to the case.
According to the original criteria of CzechTrade, the award was to be decided by 60 percent of the price offered and by the remaining 40 beauty contests, ie the quality of the project.
And the second criterion significantly helped Savov&#39;s company.
According to information from Dotyk.cz, it received one hundred points in all partial quality criteria.
As a result, this moved her ahead of another candidate, the Vltava Labe Media VLM publishing house, which offered a better price.
While Mladá fronta operated with the amount of 404,900 crowns per month, VLM offered 324,350 crowns.
Unlike Mladá fronta, however, it received below-average evaluation from the assessors in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consulting company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the Aktuálně.cz server, falls under the Economia publishing house.
The VLM publishing house raised several objections to the result of the tender, stating that its evaluation was considered unfair and insufficiently substantiated.
Following their rejection, it was decided to challenge the competition before the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
&quot;The petitioner is convinced that the contracting authority reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of the public contract on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favoring the participant Mladá fronta, as, to the detriment of the proposer and other suppliers,&quot; the proposal to initiate proceedings submitted to the Office this week published by the Currently server.
According to Michal Klíma, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM, the scoring of the selection committee seems to be an unreliable and 100% evaluation of the Mladá fronta project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
&quot;Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors to be unlikely and suspicious,&quot; Klíma told Aktuálně.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
In accordance with the law, all information about the contract you mention is published in the Contracting Authority&#39;s Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
&quot;After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we cannot comment on its progress,&quot; Štěpán Dlouhý, the media representative of the agency, told Dotyk.cz.
Mladá fronta responded with a statement according to which it considers it extremely problematic that the Economia publishing house intervened with an article in Aktuálně.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in the mentioned article.
The fact that she provided the BusinessInfo portal with editorial services in the previous four years may have helped her in the tender.
She won the contract for the first time in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is accused by the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the alleged damage to the Czech state of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czechia has been asking Great Britain for its release since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, is behind his criminalization, under whose influence the Mafra publishing house falls.
Last year, a London court dismissed Savov&#39;s appeal against extradition, but the businessman appealed.
&quot;From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the United Kingdom about the entry into force of the verdict to date,&quot; Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the Prague City Public Prosecutor&#39;s Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of Mladá fronta, Savov was a member of Harvestor Limited, a company based in Cyprus, which controlled the Samson brewery in České Budějovice, and of the Cypriot company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund buying endangered assets.
It should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the removal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker rode along the sidewalks and through the park, ending up in somersaults.
The biker attracted attention with a reckless ride on the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol began to chase him, he decided to drive in the direction of the Station.
&quot;Police officers chased the man with increased caution when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed,&quot; said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Eventually, a rescue helicopter had to fly to the accident, transporting the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Subsequently, the police found out that the biker did not have a driver&#39;s license, the license plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his serial number sanded and the license plate itself removed.
It is thus possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of further investigation.
&quot;The breath test performed to exclude the presence of alcohol in the driver on the spot, but the test showed a positive result for the substance methamphetamine,&quot; a police spokesman added.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar&#39;s move to Paris
Rules restricting the funding of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar&#39;s record-breaking transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that the PSG will have to prove that Neymar&#39;s transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some of the financial terms of Neymar&#39;s transfer to France.
Given that the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family who have become rich in energy sales, they can afford to bring Neymar into an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums on players to buy, but on the other hand, they have to prove legal sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead costs of football-related business activities.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after being appointed UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs in debt in the pursuit of new reinforcements would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP&#39;s rules shifted its focus from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spend huge sums on players and to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
Under the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to € 30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Alexander Cheferin, is determined to defend the ban on over-spending.
&quot;The FFP rules still apply, and we are determined to strengthen them in the future,&quot; Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a lump sum payment, it can spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of FFP&#39;s highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG was fined € 60 million ($ 82 million) - which was later reduced to € 20 million - and ordered to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through affiliated club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG as soon as the financing exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the billing of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymar&#39;s income in the PSG could be paid from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and officials of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar denied the fat that Neymat should become the ambassador of the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would be easily detected by UEFY officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to an insider&#39;s statement on Tuesday, UEFA did not open any investigation into the transfer of Neymar to PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous, as he is not entitled to comment on the situation with PSG, the Associated Press reported.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
Officials in the Spanish league, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar&#39;s departure, arguing that the PSG would violate FFP rules.
&quot;This is a clear case of &#39;financial doping&#39; for both the club and the state,&quot; La Liga President Javier Teba told AS Spanish newspaper, referring to the PSG club&#39;s ownership of the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports mogul, shares La Liga&#39;s same view of the club&#39;s funding.
&quot;It&#39;s a result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world in the last 15 years,&quot; Wenger said on Thursday.
&quot;Once the state becomes the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Adherence to the rules of financial fair play is very difficult, because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club. &quot;
Spartan midfielder Rosický: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický goes to the square.
Same scene as in Sunday&#39;s match against Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder started the game against Crvená Zvezda, he invented several goals, but his teammates did not aim for the black.
The Letna team pumped up with new multimillion-strong reinforcements ends after the initial double match in the European Cups.
Was it hard to do anything else with the match after the goal of Belgrade?
After the collected goal, it was necessary to score four, which was difficult for us.
At least we wanted not to lose, to gain confidence so that we had something to bounce back to other matches.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn&#39;t Sparta get into the match for so long?
The game is terribly crafted.
The opponent&#39;s combinations were much better than ours.
We didn&#39;t get to anything, we fired maybe once in the half.
Of course, that&#39;s very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponents into such positions more often.
Is the problem with a large number of report changes?
Of course, it&#39;s one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We only played three competitive matches and the line-up is still changing.
The point is for the coach to find the ideal eleven to sit down.
Is it encouraging for you to have played parts of two games in a row?
It&#39;s still just part of the match.
I myself do not know how my condition will develop and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it can&#39;t be.
It&#39;s the same as with an injury.
If you don&#39;t believe, you can&#39;t go back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we must be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Fans came again in large numbers, but left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
There was another wonderful visit, just like with Bohemka.
I&#39;m so sorry we can&#39;t make them better off.
Show off something they&#39;ll come up with next.
We can thank them for coming.
I don&#39;t remember such visits when I played here fifteen years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we are fighting with ourselves, we are playing, so it is not such an advantage for us.
An entrepreneur is to serve ten years for an extreme tax evasion.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the businessman Jiří Toman, who is to serve a significant ten years in prison for cutting taxes.
The calculated damage is 645 million crowns.
In his complaint, Toman claimed that the judiciary had violated his fundamental rights, and that the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were allegedly incomplete.
However, the constitutional judges called the complaint unfounded, ČTK found out from the court&#39;s database.
ÚS is not another court of appeal.
&quot;It cannot, as a fourth instance, consider factual or legal errors allegedly committed by ordinary courts, unless they constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,&quot; the resolution states.
Toman was judged to have fled.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the High Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the decision-making process.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage incurred.
The High Court described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
From 2005 to 2008, the man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis.
The damage of 645 million crowns occurred only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage, according to the expert, exceeded one billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to try Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise tax payments in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in only hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radomír Vybíral, to whom the judiciary imposed 13 years in prison for VAT machinations in fuel trades.
His complaint was also rejected some time ago by the Constitutional Court.
The series &quot;Summer for Survival&quot; and &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; play a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both characters from the famous 80&#39;s; so for the dirty 90&#39;s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter performed the comedy sketch &quot;The State&quot; on MTV); and, of course, for modern times, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd ran for larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
But from the franchise&#39;s point of view, it seems that someone is running out of breath.
The &quot;First Day of Camp&quot; series worked surprisingly well - not just because of absurd humor (an example is the story of the origin of a talking can of vegetables, told by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deviated from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teenage horny children - and could not draw on previous events.
The sequel &quot;Ten Years Later&quot;, in which adults play adults, does not put so much pressure on the emotional level and satire is sometimes sporadic, including a parody of thrillers from the 90&#39;s as &quot;Hand on the Cradle&quot;.
At one point, the character finds an Apple Powerbook, a roller skate, and &quot;a lot of other things from 1991&quot; on a pile of junk.
Many major storylines are repeated.
The kind-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still did not get over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panicking.
Not to mention the crazy plot, which includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is instigated by George HW Bush (very well cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is many side stories.
Especially fun is watching the eternally young Rudd with long hair aka the character of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind an old pepper.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of random madness, such as the return of the &quot;Seven Up&quot; series, until it reaches what I assume will be a logical unraveling: &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,&quot; when the whole group sets out on the final scene. premiere of &quot;Years of Survival&quot;.
&quot;Comrade Detective&quot; on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to another type of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of &quot;Such Normal Americans,&quot; &quot;Atomic Blonde: No Regret,&quot; and even &quot;GLOW,&quot; in which the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes clash.
Directed by Rhyes Thomas, the comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak is set as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, which was dubbed into the English language by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It&#39;s a great idea.
Unfortunately, it&#39;s not much more.
You will laugh at some jokes (such as police officers watching chess on television - a parody of American football).
Many well-known actors have given their voice to the series, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; focuses too much on the awkward propaganda drama - which includes the killer with Reagan&#39;s mask - and that&#39;s what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too lengthy and there are not enough comedic moments.
With a shorter footage, propaganda satire in &quot;Comrade Detective&quot; could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, where two fat people devour burgers stacked in a large pile.
A clear message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
Fictional Romanian artists were right: we do so with our own culture as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not see the lifting of the IAAF start ban.
At the Congress in London, the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian competitors due to a state-sponsored doping program.
As expected, the voting at the venue of the World Cup, which starts on Friday, turned out very clearly.
166 delegates were in favor of extending the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is mainly the fact that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as stated before the Congress by the head of the IAAF special investigation group, Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, many suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and coaches with a tarnished reputation are still working in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not yet fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
&quot;Even though progress has been made, much work remains to be done,&quot; said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost last year&#39;s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will take part in the upcoming World Cup, who have previously proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start at the championship in national colors and in case of victory they will not play the Russian anthem.
Bank of England holds interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following modest economic growth and weakening inflation, which has stifled speculation of sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot;in the background&quot; in maintaining interest rates - despite squeezing family budgets.
Politicians from the Bank of England&#39;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote to raise interest rates supported weak economic growth, supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecast growth at 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank indicated that growth should increase due to inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years, and also stated that real estate rents should increase more than expected in the financial markets.
Committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package to boost the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result, the Term Financing Plan is expected to come into force next February, offering cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer £ 15 billion less than the planned £ 115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: &quot;MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with the pressure on real household incomes and the burden on consumption.&quot;
On the topic of rates, the bank said that it would be necessary to &quot;tighten the belts of monetary policy&quot; to calm inflation, &quot;to a greater extent&quot; than the markets expect.
Markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that any increase would be &quot;gradual&quot; and &quot;limited&quot;.
The bank has lowered its growth forecast for this year and next compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
The expected growth in 2018 of 1.8% remained unchanged.
Following the publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $ 1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stood at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest report on inflation is a small consolation for households affected by rising inflation and meager wage increases. The bank said that the situation would worsen before the increase.
The report goes on to say that monetary policy &quot;cannot prevent&quot; revenue cuts in the coming years, but that wages are expected to rise &quot;significantly&quot; towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also expected to grow due to strong interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which will offset the lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% last August in response to a shocking vote on an EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank&#39;s decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households. Three politicians demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the bank said it expected such a change and inflation should rise again over the next month.
The bank stated that the excess relative to the 2% target was &quot;completely&quot; due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in swap rates, it appears that competition in the mortgage market will only increase once lenders start competing for contracts with a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks especially good for those whose existing contracts and mortgages expire - there are no-offer options as well as low rates that are gaining in popularity. ”
The NHS prescribes a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
From September, patients will gain access to &#39;transformative&#39; HIV prevention treatment based on the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to fund the NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-sex prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients in a three-year trial times.
NSH agreed to fund a probationary period after the Court of Appeal upheld a decision by the Supreme Court last year stating that the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP, despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by NHS England from CEO Simon Stevens as a &#39;significant intervention&#39;, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a &#39;decisive moment&#39;.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Additional clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
PrEP pre-sex application means that there are enough specific drugs in the patient&#39;s body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will designate eligible participants who will sign a consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential testing.
The program will cost taxpayers £ 10 million and the NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute the drugs after winning an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use, and large-scale implementation.
Simon Stevens added: &#39;This important intervention should complement and fully exploit the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than thirty years of efforts to halt one of the greatest challenges to human health. &#39;
Deborah Gold, executive director of the NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: &#39;We are witnessing a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP is given the opportunity to transform the English HIV epidemic if given correctly and at risk for patients.
From September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We welcome this statement. &#39;
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: &#39;The number one priority must be to rapidly deploy tests across the country; we must ensure that it is available to every patient.
We now have the trial drug PrEP and are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV. &#39;
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: &#39;The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug may be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV, and together to stop the spread of HIV in society. &#39;
Living on a high footing: the mezzanine and clever design have turned this small apartment on Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, replaced a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 with an apartment on Earls Cour.
Located on the first floor of the clever Queen Anne Terrace - it is a demonstration of modern design that makes the most of the space available.
&quot;I used to live with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in Knightsbridge,&quot; Joanne said.
&quot;I was looking for something for a more reasonable price.
I came across this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away and nodded at him the same day. &quot;
Since then, the 1000 square meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
One-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the high ceiling.
&quot;I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands, &quot;she said.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based Duck &amp; Shed and used a nearly four-foot ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps could fit on top of each other - the challenge for the architects was to create a mezzanine floor on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
&quot;The steel structure is quite complicated,&quot; he explained.
&quot;We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but also of bending the steel structure so that it was at the right height above and below the ceiling. ”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - while adding to the drama.
On the mezzanine floor, old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design overlook the beautiful living room.
The mirrored furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor has mirrors on both sides, making it look longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
At the front door there are storage rooms equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility of separating it from the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
&quot;We had to solve the technical side,&quot; Erfan says of the reinforced veneered door.
&quot;The door has a counterweight to make it very easy to roll.&quot;
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
&quot;When it comes down to it, what you&#39;re selling is living space - or valuing your property,&quot; Erfan said.
&quot;A real estate agent basically calculates his price when entering an apartment based on his living space.&quot;
In this case, we managed to increase the living space while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious look.
&quot;The material is very important because you touch it and form an emotional bond with home,&quot; Erfan added.
&quot;You won&#39;t fall in love with the electrical wiring in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts will not win. ”
As it turned out, a quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you may eventually decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is widening.
California has banned its citizens from traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and declared a retaliatory ban on its citizens traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, US citizens can travel freely in all fifty states.
The point is that California has banned state money from traveling on its citizens to eight other states, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly in favor of LGBT and considers any expression of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a conscientious objection law that states that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with LGBT patients has no obligation to provide it to them, but has a duty to provide those patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws under which religious charities that have given mothers children after birth for adoption are not required to provide those children for adoption to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has banned funding for its citizens&#39; travel to eight states.
In practice, this means that California professors must not be reimbursed by their universities for scientific symposia in Texas, for example, because they are co-financed by the State of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants to travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund citizens&#39; trips from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience and its parliament passed a resolution stating that it also dislikes California&#39;s policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not impose a travel embargo on California.
He imposes them in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state in the Union that would impose a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That&#39;s the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of it is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass conscientious objection laws, as well as decide what their money will go to and what they must not.
Second, what&#39;s wrong with conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can&#39;t he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty of punishment, force him to sell pork when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a heavy fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why punish him and leave him alone and not order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their domestic, domestic policies in non-federal powers according to their own, ie, the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance of themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance of others.
According to them, no one should ever again show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I do not know the situation in American history, where states deliberately did so on political issues, except for one case.
Even in times of struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s, the political cause was slavery and the North was fighting against the South.
Of course, nothing like that will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the Blue Democratic States and the Red Republican States is widening and the United States is mentally disintegrating internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critics of Putin were fined.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating the rules of the campaign ahead of next year&#39;s presidential election.
The court fined him for calling on people to take part in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests and announced that he wants to run for head of state in March next year.
The current head of the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said police arrived at his house in the morning and took him to court.
He fined him for calling people to demonstrate through videos posted on YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
&quot;We will take them off the judge&#39;s salary later,&quot; a Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
Russia&#39;s election commission recently concluded that Navalny could not run in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the ruling to be politically motivated.
The court also fined two members of the Naval Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin, on Thursday for fines of 300,000 rubles and 25,000 rubles.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became the dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in the campaign in every possible way.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry company.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is so final, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $ 500 million
More than four decades after the empire was founded by their Italian family, the two brothers are now vying for one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $ 500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives on the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who drove the dispute over joint property and business to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but a fierce dispute is constantly disputed in the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family bought the first store in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this place, the family founded the company Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain with 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $ 85 million.
Additional real estate was purchased for the money, and the De Lutis family&#39;s portfolio now includes offices, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company&#39;s assets, while his father Colin, who, in Paul&#39;s words, is a &quot;significant driving force and dominant figure&quot; of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court records state that Colin owns property worth $ 316 million, while Paul manages the property for $ 176 million.
The division of property and funds became a problem for Paul.
&quot;In my eyes, Colin&#39;s proposal was strongly in his favor,&quot; Paul wrote in an affidavit in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at peace, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also vying for who will run the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin cut him off.
Colin disputes that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanaging some properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful settlement of the conflict.
&quot;My Italian origins dictate to me that family is the most important thing,&quot; he wrote.
The cost of litigation is rising. Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and news from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and advocates for both parties.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had operated milk bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
For the money raised by the mortgage, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the family&#39;s first jeans business.
Colin said when he founded Westco &quot;in his senior year of college, Paul was still a small boy, about 10 years old.&quot;
Anna De Lutis said that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to the sons would go well.
&quot;Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court,&quot; she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family of companies. Colin said Mark was compensated with $ 10 million when he left and Luke with $ 26 million.
As Paul, Luke and Mark put it, &quot;they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.&quot;
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite being a former board member of the AFL Club, according to Eddie McGuire, Colin&#39;s well-known television personality and best friend, in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only replied in a text message stating that, given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, &quot;I have nothing to add&quot;.
&quot;It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to settle the whole matter in court,&quot; he wrote.
In mid-2016, in a court statement, Colin said he was trying to adapt to his brother&#39;s demands.
&quot;Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;he still hopes for a successful solution.&quot;
On Friday, all hopes were out of sight.
&quot;Our disputes will be settled in court soon,&quot; Colin wrote.
Heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers pack water and summer clothes.
In the Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4, which is now attended by about 35 children, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and the planted trees do not provide much shade yet.
There is no swimming pool, but the teachers shower in the fog.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms, where the blinds and curtains are closed.
They try to cool the air with an air purifier, because they do not have air conditioning.
It is also challenging for teachers and cooks.
&quot;The temperature, which is both indoors and outdoors, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so during this period we should not even have an open operation,&quot; said the director of the kindergarten Miloslava Makovičková.
There is a glass corridor in the kindergarten, where, according to her, the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning after 6 o&#39;clock, the windows close and we have blinds on the south sides to protect ourselves.
&quot;But it won&#39;t help much,&quot; she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have mature trees on the land, so we are under them.
&quot;We have a beautiful walnut tree, there is a table under it, and we do various things there,&quot; described the kindergarten director Barbora Kompanová.
Teachers try to go to the forest with their children, where it is cooler.
Children get wet hats and there are various water games on the program.
&quot;We have a hand-held pressure sprayer, which is used for spraying flowers, and we use it to shower children,&quot; said Kompanová.
The director of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prague&#39;s Prosek, Jitka Vilimovská, also said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
&quot;We have a fairly large garden, so they&#39;re under the trees,&quot; she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3 p.m.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose low-sweetened tea or diluted juice and have water drinks in the garden.
Every day, they also have a vegetable salad to eat and always fresh fruit and vegetables for snacks, which are sometimes brought to them by their parents.
&quot;For example, today one mother brought about a ten-kilo watermelon for children here,&quot; Makovičková added.
Drivers receive water or summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of tram and bus drivers are in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger area.
So far, the high-temperature tram tracks have not been seriously damaged.
Minor damage occurred in the loop in Hostivař.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks available.
&quot;Chilled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and depots,&quot; said Řehková.
In depots and at some changing places, employees have so-called sodobars available, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ionic drinks.
&quot;They can also use a summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts,&quot; the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the entire Czech Republic liquidated 108, ie twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly employed in the fight against fire.
&quot;Fires in the natural environment predominate, as well as those associated with harvest work,&quot; said fire spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
Even the evening change in the weather did not bring relief to the firefighters, when the heat was replaced by storms and torrential rains in many places.
In connection with the storms, firefighters set out for 236 interventions.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
&quot;They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region,&quot; Zaoralová continues.
However, the help of firefighters was also needed in Stvolinky in the Českolipsko region, where 60 people from the children&#39;s camp were evacuated to safety due to a storm.
Tropical temperatures also gave work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday nights, ambulances departed for a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from kar.
Therefore, people should have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released during incomplete combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache, and fainting.
If poisoning is suspected, the infected room must be left.
Trump&#39;s new chief of staff plans to curtail the president&#39;s media diet
Many before him tried it and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico said the new chief of staff at the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including reports on television news - in hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here is part of reporter Josh Dawsey&#39;s report:
&quot;When John F. Kelly, the new White House Chief of Staff, met with staff on the first day in office, he outlined a key issue for Trump&#39;s White House he intended to correct: incorrect information coming into the hands of the president.
Kelly told employees that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or spoken - because the president could make better decisions based on the right information. &quot;
Kelly&#39;s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth in controlling Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump&#39;s relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now that he&#39;s sitting in the White House, his habit of watching television news is even stronger.
&quot;If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by honest reports, it was convenient to show him that a lot of other media talked about him in a positive light, which was easier to convince,&quot; Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote from the Politico portal at the time that &quot;the key to keeping Trump&#39;s tweets in check - at least according to six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that praise him.&quot;
Good.
However, the idea that Trump&#39;s tendency to post his opinions on Twitter was once &quot;under control&quot; is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something others don&#39;t know - that Trump&#39;s tweets would be more outrageous if someone didn&#39;t check them.
We&#39;ll probably never know about tweets that Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least a few times, then their efforts were not in vain.
However, no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from sparking controversial issues.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly seek to strengthen their agenda by triggering Trump materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their worldview.
In May, the Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the tendency of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
The following is an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher:
&quot;Current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angrily to negative media reports, especially leaks, and seeks to find their origins.
The situation occurred in late February when someone pushed a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - to accuse the deputy chief of staff, Katie Walsh, of being a &#39;source of many leaks&#39; from the White House.
Regardless, Johnson was forever fired from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had made false allegations in the past and later dropped them.
Trump read the article and began asking Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter &quot;sought to implement a system to manage and document the information President Trump will receive.&quot;
Would it work?
Kelly is trying to pursue the same strategy now, three months later.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump&#39;s impulsiveness doesn&#39;t just disappear and his assistants are still vying for power.
These unchanging factors will certainly make Kelly&#39;s mission more difficult.
Tourists negotiate moat and return to &#39;Millionaire&#39;s Quarter&#39;
Some of the most wealthy homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again embarking on determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the right to reclaim fields behind their residences.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field on a thriving street in Solihull, nicknamed the &#39;millionaire district&#39;.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being deported in May. They were not afraid of the ditch, which was dug on the spot by order of the authorities in order to prevent their intrusion.
The tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with the caravans through an unprotected gap that served as a way.
Angry residents attacked Solihull&#39;s city council, saying it was &#39;unable to solve the problem&#39;.
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: &#39;They occupied the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the issue.
All the tourists were moved to another place and have now returned.
Others arrived last night, and today there will probably be more. &#39;
She added: &#39;The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem. He uses court orders to protect the parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and do not intend to continue paying taxes until the board has dealt with the tourists. &#39;
Another anonymous resident said: &#39;It&#39;s ridiculous. We just watched the last departing tourists and now they are back.
And this time there are even more, and this time they brought horses with them. &#39;
A spokesman for Solihull City Council said: &#39;We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the land near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, are taking the necessary legal steps to successfully resolve the issue.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any unsocial or illegal behavior to the police at 101.
This will give us an overall picture to present in court. &#39;
The MEP&#39;s husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
A government special transported the wounded Robert Zitnansky to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under the constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
According to information from TV JOJ, Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He is said to have been hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported home, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of Bratislava&#39;s hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of the Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
The Italians are stepping up in the fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving on the Italian coast with Mediterranean immigrants unless the NGO signs new rules governing their operations.
&quot;If NGOs do not sign the new code of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,&quot; Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti&#39;s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a German rescue jug, Jugend Rettet, on suspicion of human trafficking, greatly facilitating illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which has been operating for the first year, declined to comment on the case due to allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
&quot;For us, saving lives is and will always be the number one priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at the moment, &quot;the organization said in a statement on social networks.
&quot;We can comment on all current allegations only after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation.&quot;
Italian authorities have been tracking the Iuventa ship of the Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying immigrants on board the ship, who were handed over directly to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
According to the applicant, at least one meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya. The course of the meeting was published by the Italian media.
The ship&#39;s crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta&#39;s MOAS and Spain&#39;s Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organization said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not constitute a &quot;substantial change or obstacle&quot; to rescue operations.
For example, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), a Nobel laureate, has refused to adopt a new code of conduct.
Minniti, meanwhile, has said that the sharp decline in immigrants landing in Italy as part of rescue operations in recent weeks suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
&quot;In recent days, we are beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; the minister said.
He also unveiled plans for further talks this month with the mayor of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of achieving Europe.
Shameless Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite crawled out of her overalls!
Hot summer days are completely tempting to wear only the essentials that cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and everyone who has something to do with TV Prima, just swarmed, she wrapped her body in a mini overall.
And just a few normal movements were enough and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her ass.
He overheard herself between the halves as many times, and he also pulled her so high that she still had to adjust it.
She certainly did not need the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages urging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her friend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentionally killing Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy&#39;s father testified in court on Thursday: &quot;The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend. &quot;
Carter was left at large until a decision was made.
She was facing up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood still with tears in her eyes, clasped hands, and eyes pointing to the ground.
&quot;Her actions killed Conrad Roy,&quot; the plaintiff told the judge.
&quot;She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility, &quot;she said.
&quot;She showed no remorse.&quot;
However, Carter&#39;s lawyer said it was &quot;an unfortunate circumstance he regrets.&quot;
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that &quot;her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her conduct.&quot;
The plaintiff read a statement from Roy&#39;s mother, Lynn Roy,: &quot;Not a day goes by that I don&#39;t mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever, &quot;the statement said.
Roy&#39;s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was &quot;haunted&quot; by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother&#39;s wedding and never be the aunt of his children.
&quot;The loss of a person I&#39;ve seen since I was born is a pain that I will carry with me for life,&quot; she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that would penalize a person helping to commit another person&#39;s suicide. This case therefore sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the seat of a car in 2014, poisoned by carbon dioxide.
The case caught the attention of the entire nation after Carter&#39;s text messages inciting suicide were released.
&quot;Maybe hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don&#39;t care,&quot; the text messages Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family vacation said.
A few minutes before suicide, she wrote, &quot;You have to do this, Conrade,&quot; and &quot;Just turn on the generator and you&#39;ll be free and happy.&quot;
Judge Moniz said Carter longed for attention through Roy&#39;s death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of Carter&#39;s side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was acquitted two years ago.
Miss Knox, 30, said in the Los Angeles Times: &quot;Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.&quot;
Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to the sharp response
Just one day before the announcement by Audi, carmaker BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW President said the company believes that &quot;there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions&quot; in response to European cities - including BMW-based Munich - which are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European carmakers have largely promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to comply with carbon dioxide regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the costs of automobiles for the installation of equipment for neutralizing gases emitted by diesel engines are increasing, which makes the competitiveness of cars more difficult.
While German carmakers face careful inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of pampering powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced emissions during testing, but the software was deactivated under normal conditions.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been indicted in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
A former head of thermodynamics at Audi&#39;s engine development department in Germany would be arrested last month.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face legal action in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German police criminal investigation into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission limits - spreading the allegations facing Audi in the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could have an adverse effect on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen&#39;s profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
The man and the girl perished.
The accident occurred on Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the SIC Noticias television channel said that the plane was flying just above the people who were sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people allegedly fled the beach from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people did not manage to escape from the machine.
According to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach.
&quot;The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot,&quot; said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both escaped alive from the accident and taken by police to be questioned.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are highways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I&#39;ll give you a riddle.
It is unfinished, although it began to be built in 1978.
Even if it is unfinished, it is constantly being repaired.
And it can&#39;t be built anymore, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, Hradec Králové highway D11.
The construction of another section of it was stopped for at least a few months by the Children of the Earth movement.
We Eastern Czechs get the highway piece by piece, like slicing salami.
The wheel will be cut and then it will be seen when and if we will get another one at all.
At the same time, we do not want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to or from Poland from villages and towns.
Endless streams of trucks go directly through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a sensible way around.
But the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not even a knock since.
Therefore, when the construction of the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové began recently, and archaeological research began on other sections to Jaroměř, with construction starting at the end of this year, you could hear a loud banging of plugs in Eastern Bohemia.
After all, no one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that there will be no construction this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has disintegrated.
The children of Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They challenged the building permit decision in its entirety.
In the appeal, they request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Hradec Králové City Hall, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defense or the Railway Authority.
So far, we are coming off the D11 near the village with the eloquent name Pohřebačka.
So we go down, we just go on the highway and suddenly we are on a side road and we prefer to join the column.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the country.
A scary, constantly congested road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone has their own Undertaker.
What do the Children of the Earth demand?
What is the essence of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network practically incomplete in the current system?

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in southeastern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to the dry climate and harmful insects, which is terrifying the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “Lavender cultivation in Provence is under threat because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the last few years, with less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
The cicadas and locusts transmitting micro-bacteria, which thrive in arid climates, are also to blame. ”
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil that is made from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is, of course, smaller. &quot;
A possible solution may be more efficient distribution of water and slowing down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
Riodoce staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news of the unrest in the Sinaloa area, involving organized criminals, corrupt officials and unceasing drug wars.
Today, however, it is meeting under the onslaught of recent events mainly for its own safety.
They learn that it is important that they change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: to take their children with them to an office that was attacked by a grenade in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to each word - no evidence is needed, just use your imagination and foreboding.
Choose from what - drug traffickers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals tasked with covering up criminal activity.
The violence does not stop and the bodies pile up all over the country; There are a growing number of journalists among them: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 of them since President Enrique Pen Niet took power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven were killed this year in all seven states.
Among them is the co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
&quot;The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,&quot; Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His loss is palpable, even though his presence is all-pervading - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription &quot;Justice&quot;, to which the mediator points, hangs in front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over the age of 30, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the establishment of a special federal prosecutor&#39;s office in 2010 to deal with journalists&#39; cases, it has so far sued two suspects, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. The killers of journalists are very exceptionally in court.
Riodoca journalists insist on reporting on the violence in Sinaloe; despite the fact that they are being destroyed by grief and this territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without a vision of justice, the security meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
&quot;It&#39;s foolish to waste time on such meetings,&quot; he adds.
&quot;If we don&#39;t get more information, no one can be trusted.&quot;
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoca in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to drive a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 bullets, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then got into his car and crashed him not far from the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors in Culiacan seem to be spreading fast.
In Valdez&#39;s case, however, silence is suspicious.
Since Guzmán&#39;s arrest last year and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country&#39;s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions struggle to fill the gap.
Several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi every day, and the cemetery is full of ornate two-story mausoleums for drug lords, many of whom are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment, the word &quot;truce&quot; means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important drug routes to the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoce, still accuses himself of failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with Joaquin Guzman&#39;s sons.
Peace could anger the sons; the suspicious gang members bought all copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscating other newspapers in which the same story was published.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the struggle of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had survived so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In the periodical Noroeste, he was practically a veteran when he decided in 2003 to sell his shares worth $ 50 and found together with five colleagues Riodoca.
In Sinaloe, &quot;it was impossible to run a journalism without mentioning the drug trade,&quot; Bojorquez said.
Over time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for brave and truthful reporting; the newspaper began to prosper.
Journalists liked to search for problematic topics and publish uncensored texts - readers were fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce has won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for its report on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his brave reports on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was scared.
&quot;I was worried about my life,&quot; he said as he accepted the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a &quot;way of life,&quot; Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
&quot;You have to take on the role of a journalist - or play the fool.
I don&#39;t want anyone to ask me, &#39;What did you do face to face with death ... why didn&#39;t you say what was going on?&#39; &quot;
The employees of Riodoc miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions in them about his own assumptions - how to do his best work and stay alive?
&quot;They don&#39;t like it when you get involved with their wives, children, clean shops, secret airfields.&quot;
&quot;These things were forbidden,&quot; Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is not playing here, hands off.
The problem is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, &quot;smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing happened to Javier.&quot;
According to him, the old rules, as well as the others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce employees meet; Spyware was discovered a few days ago that governments were buying to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief from a forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the Riodoce offices, located in a four-story building in the Culiacan neighborhood.
Journalists are wondering if these police officers are not among the 50 percent of law enforcement officers who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists last set out for the mountainous areas, which are essentially dominated by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week&#39;s agenda.
The first is the murder of former boxer brother Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
They are also blamed for suspicious government spending that took place in the hometown of the governor of the state.
There have also been several kidnappings recently in one of Culiacan&#39;s most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor&#39;s office.
No one officially disclosed the identity of the abductees or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were wary of writing about what everyone in the city knew: that the restaurant was a popular destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which controls all levels of the political scene for almost the past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents in the restaurant, including one in which one of Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán&#39;s sons escaped an army intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez&#39;s column, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
&quot;Valdez would certainly solve the case,&quot; said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed &quot;El Flaco&quot; for his slender figure.
&quot;Now all the informants have turned their backs on us.&quot;
Valdez&#39;s office was turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor&#39;s office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez&#39;s assassination in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
Only a charred body was discovered. Authorities say the DNA analysis is Adamea.
Journalist activity is escalating across the country. Many of them organize protests and scribble on the sidewalks and buildings of the &quot;SOS press&quot;.
The director of the newspaper, Bojorquez, is visiting Washington for a day, trying to gain international support and justice for Valdez&#39;s death.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloy the day after Valdez&#39;s assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murder for preaching the truth.
In the meantime, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are &quot;surrounded&quot; by organized crime, corrupt officials and the indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-journalism, he wrote that journalists were dying not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces working with organized crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 accused police officers and public officials of more than half of all attacks on journalists.
&quot;You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you,&quot; Ramirez added.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which took place six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found, along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: &quot;This is how I ended up because of my reports.&quot;
Next to the severed head lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to close down, such as the El Norte newspaper, based on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March assassination of the rapporteur, Miroslava Breachová.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the killing of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled &quot;What do you want from us&quot;?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It&#39;s a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly persecuting you.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their work, it is a big risk every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
&quot;Mexico is going to hell, that&#39;s why I became a journalist,&quot; he said.
It&#39;s midnight on Friday, and Riodoce employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest issue has been sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly rings.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area by members of the syndicate have promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by and the introductory title changes again.
The sounds of police sirens indicate another shootout.
Bojorquez glances at the police patrol to see if they&#39;re being careful.
If they are afraid, they do not show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose mediator is an eloquent slogan for all of Sinaloe - all Riodoca employees follow in his footsteps.
&quot;How could we even think of leaving,&quot; said Bojorquez, &quot;when an internist asked me to send her to the streets the same day Javier was killed?&quot;
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, no matter how scary.
Researchers have now uncovered the findings of the first finds of an amazing rhino-sized creature, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called the &#39;Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs&#39; - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains have been preserved to such a high degree that experts have been able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin, stating that the dinosaur had a &#39;problematic past&#39;.
An article in Current Biology stated that it is &#39;the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world&#39;.
Fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. The dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described him as &#39;truly remarkable&#39;.
According to National Geographic, an armored whitewright is the best-preserved fossil of its kind to date.
Behind the finding is Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After finishing the work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
&#39;Just close your eyes a little and you&#39;ll believe he&#39;s asleep,&#39; said Caleb Brown, chief of the work, and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
&#39;It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved species of dinosaur - the Mona Lisa dinosaur.&#39;
By studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - most likely faced a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect itself from predators and used a camouflage system used by many of today&#39;s animals.
Experts claim that this allowed him to blend in better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system suggests that it was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of a 110 million-year-old dinosaur of the family Nodosauridae first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for inspection at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the wonderfully preserved condition of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered the method of camouflage commonly used by today&#39;s animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers&#39; findings are surprising because Borealopelta&#39;s size far exceeds today&#39;s animals using the same technique.
Thus, it is possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation.
Many contemporary camouflaged animals — such as deer, zebra, and / or armadillo — are much smaller and also more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
&quot;The predation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators in the Cretaceous,&quot; Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was probably reddish-brown in color.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more information about its life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to track down its last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The Alberta region had the same climate at the time as present-day Florida, and rivers and oceans stretched farther inland than they do today.
&quot;This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time is preserved in three dimensions, so we can see its original size,&quot; Brown said.
&#39;For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as in the Cretaceous.
You don&#39;t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just close your eyes a little and it looks like he&#39;s just sleeping. &#39;
In the Cretaceous period, huge theropods walked around the Earth, carnivorous dinosaurs that moved on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been a favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5 meter long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelt&#39;s body was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
The find is behind Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in a Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm spines protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of present-day Canada until it ended up in a river that washed him into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, &#39;finding an individual in this way can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the shocking finding I find.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his toes pointing up.
I can easily count the scales on his foot. &#39;
How did one activist find out the answer to the question, &#39;Whose Streets?&#39;
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook all over.
The day after she arrived in New York, the native of St. Louis sat on the bed in the Airbnb room and went through the Facebook posts on her phone.
At the same time, she came across the contribution of a high school student.
&quot;Police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still on the street,&quot; he said.
She was surprised that no one else had written this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
@TheePharoah Retweeted her wall posts.
Rapper of St. Louis posted on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old boy shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown&#39;s body lying helplessly on the street, from which no one had taken him even after four hours.
&quot;That&#39;s crazy,&quot; Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down the phone to return to him in the evening, watching tweets about people gathered on Canfield Drive.
She watched photos of police tapes and roaring people. One of the men claimed to be the victim&#39;s father, holding a sign saying &quot;Ferguson police killed my unarmed son&quot;!
She watched the live news - one of the policemen was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another policeman, she said, was holding a gun in his hand, aiming at the crowd and shouting, &quot;I&#39;ll kill you all ... animals.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s not normal,&quot; Ferrell said to herself.
&quot;This is not the type of murder we are used to that we can call normal.
I felt goosebumps all over my body.
&quot;I was angry and cried.&quot;
She immediately booked a return flight and left home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described in the new documentary &quot;Whose Streets?&quot;, Which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and steadfastness, told from the perspective of people living in the community who take to the streets and demand an answer.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell had a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headdress - on a subject they had discussed many times before - &quot;the experience of blacks.&quot;
&quot;Remember how I taught you how blacks had to fight for what they believed in?&quot; He recalls the interview.
&quot;We&#39;re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old, and that&#39;s not right.&quot;
&quot;It was out of the question that I wouldn&#39;t take her with me,&quot; Ferrell said later.
&quot;Today&#39;s events are the culmination ... of the past.
He had to know and see it with his own eyes and grow up in it.
Not only did she need to develop in activism and organization, but she also needed to know the difference between the different layers of the black experience and what we had to do to break free.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism first hand, she is no different from any other black child woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her. &quot;
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop on South Florissant Road was opposite the police department, which became a base of activists awaiting police officer Darren Wilson&#39;s words about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for the others.
Together, they prepared food in bags and helped distribute it to Protestants.
In Ferrell&#39;s eyes, a new type of activism was slowly emerging.
&quot;My activism turned upside down after August 9,&quot; Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to establish health care and food in black communities.
&quot;I had no experience with organization.
It was natural. &quot;
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, a later co-director of the documentary, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to &quot;just document&quot; the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, &quot;Are you working on a documentary or trying to find a story that can be used?&quot;
This type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to capitalize on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, &quot;We&#39;ve heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are often overlooked, and we wanted to change that.&quot;
Folayan has already partnered with co-director Damon Davis, a respected local artist on the subject of death row inmates.
His involvement in the project also interested Ferrell and six other locals, followed by the Whose Streets? Team in the years following Brown&#39;s assassination.
&quot;No one speaks for us in this document, but it&#39;s our statement,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way.&quot;
While the aim of the documentary was not to focus on Ferrell&#39;s experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement &quot;is not about a savior leader, but about the rapprochement of the community,&quot; Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most open to film participation.
The documentary &quot;Whose Streets?&quot; Thus describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell&#39;s life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
&quot;I felt naked,&quot; Ferrell said with a smile on her face, thinking of the first moment she&#39;d seen the final version of the document.
&quot;But I understand that in order to do this work and humanize black people, I have to open up.&quot;
Ferrell&#39;s story also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement&#39;s three founders - who created a campaign on social media in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves freaks.
&quot;Black eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately behind maintaining the movement,&quot; Ferrell said, &quot;because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women have to bear the brunt of these events. ”
Folayan agrees, adding that &quot;the movement is in fact supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women.&quot;
However, she insists that &quot;this is not just an affirmative matter&quot; and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of her views.
&quot;She was the driving force and source of energy,&quot; she said.
&quot;It was no coincidence that she was in the front lines, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black geeky woman is dangerous.
You can feel the rush of energy in front of the screen. &quot;
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television stations have cleared their positions, but difficult racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year condition for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in the area, which she calls home, as &quot;Mess.&quot;
Nevertheless, he has not stopped the effort he has committed to since taking to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
&quot;It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose are our chains. ”
A field was burning in the Kolín region.
Dozens of firefighters came to the scene, and a helicopter also helped.
Near Český Brod in the Kolín region, between the villages of Bylany and Liblice, a field of approximately 15 hectares was burning from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, the firefighters declared the third degree of fire alarm out of four possible.
According to firefighter spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, a helicopter also helped put out a fire from the air.
At 18:00, firefighters managed to put out the fire, the fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the combine.
A helicopter, which made a total of six drops of water, also helped to put out the fire.
&quot;We handed over the place of the intervention to the owner, until tomorrow at 8:00 it will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters,&quot; Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: the artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning&#39;s DNA
In the center of one of the rooms in New York&#39;s Fridman Gallery are several faces of different skin tones - white, black and brown - hung from the ceiling on wires. Each of them seemed to fall out of sight of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral and hair swabs sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized publication of secret cablegrams on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which began on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before he left the US presidency.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning&#39;s DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual, commentary on the pliability of DNA - as well as the many ways DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these. interpretations as well as identities.
Born Bradley Edward Manning, Manning has said since she was a woman that she considered herself a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including violations of six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were held by prison staff. Only one lower-quality black-and-white photograph leaked to the public, in which Manning, visibly worried, is sitting in the driver&#39;s seat in the platinum-blonde wig she is now associated with.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions.
In this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
&quot;They were planning an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add a portrait to the article,&quot; Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama asked for Manning&#39;s release a few days after the comics were issued, a welcome change after several unbearable years in a Kansas military prison.
It is indeed interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people seeking government disclosure and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to use his tweets to incite resentment in the areas he should support.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that &quot;everything happens for a reason.&quot;
Under a statement from the artist on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter &quot;i&quot; in the surname is dotted with heart) after the end of &quot;self-factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.&quot;
On the opposite side are the sequences of its mitochondrial DNA - the centipede of the letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist&#39;s sophisticated scientific vocabulary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar we are, at least biologically,.
&quot;I hope people get away with it, that our genome doesn&#39;t care who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and can be interpreted by everyone,&quot; Dewey-Hagborg said. You can also see her work Spurious Memories from 2007 on the topic of video.
&quot;DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them.&quot;
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novel.
It shows Manning emerging in the manner of King Kong from the United States Disiplinary Barracks Prison with a megaphone in his hand.
&quot;As soon as they stop you from speaking, they will win,&quot; it says.
&quot;Never be silenced.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a direct transcript of one of the letters,&quot; said the Philadelphia artist.
&quot;When I think about it, I get goosebumps.&quot;
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - as predicted in the comics - but when that happens, she will be greeted in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genome portraits lined up like a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the almost 160 cm high statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded in pencil.
&quot;In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to radiate the feeling of a crowd,&quot; Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
&quot;I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that took the form of Chelsea and frees it.&quot;
Professor of North West University and an employee of Oxford University wanted for murder
A nationwide search for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted on suspicion of murdering a man found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said, is being searched nationwide.
An arrest warrant was issued on Monday for a first-degree murder of a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to a Cook County court file.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died as a result of several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Police officers were notified of this fact by telephone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau has been pronounced dead on the spot and detectives are investigating the case as a murder. Police, meanwhile, are looking for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university&#39;s vice president of public relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now on administrative leave and was denied access to the university&#39;s school premises.
&quot;The matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating fully with them,&quot; Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: &quot;We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the American police as well.&quot;
The statement also states that Warren&#39;s colleagues were shocked by the whole fact and want him to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations at the Chicago Police Department, said he was urging suspects to surrender to the authorities.
&quot;Police have information about their whereabouts and efforts to track down suspects are escalating,&quot; Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in searching for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a phone call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment no. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were intercepted by security cameras.
&quot;We believe Professor Latham knew his victim,&quot; Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to all residents: &quot;Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and to investigate various motives, including domestic violence.&quot;
&quot;We will complete the WADA plan in the near future&quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria were implemented and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) re-established.
&quot;Part of the criteria of the new plan have now been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, the WADA plan was updated, &quot;Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA&#39;s plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for renewing RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation&#39;s website.
According to Mutek, the code does not contain anything that Russia should worry about.
&quot;Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, &quot;he added.
However, one of these criteria calls for the public announcement of the results of a WADA investigation by Richard McLaren about the alleged government sponsorship of doping of Russian athletes.
Mutko said: &quot;We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
However, there were no state programs in our country, so we cannot admit to something that never existed. &quot;
Mutka&#39;s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia&#39;s RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: &quot;We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report without any reservations, &quot;Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of imposing doping controls within Russia in November 2015, immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization approved the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organization&#39;s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was &quot;on the right track&quot; to restore its validity.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
The police accused three men of starting Wednesday&#39;s fire in a rare wooden church in Třinec-Guty in the Frýdek-Místek region.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for the crime of general endangerment.
The Moravian-Silesian police director Tomáš Kužel told the press today.
According to him, it was an intentional crime.
&quot;It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive for the whole matter,&quot; Kužel said.
He said that the police will discuss the possible taking of the accused into custody.
According to the director, further information cannot be published.
&quot;I can&#39;t say more yet, because the staff of the criminal police and investigation service and the public prosecutor who is supervising the case are actually working on the case,&quot; Kužel said.
The wooden Church of the Corpus Christi in Guty dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, the material damage will amount to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, other costs are ready to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared, and the contribution of the owner of the monument, ie the local parish, is being planned.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by fire fifteen years ago.
It was then caused by a fault in the electrical installation.
An exact copy was created in its place.
The state counts on citizens to defend the state.
It will support their training.
Financial support for associations usable in state defense, voluntary shooting training or a team of training trainers is provided for by the substantive intent of the Act on the Readiness of Citizens for State Defense.
The Ministry of Defense, which was given the task by the government, promises that it will be able to increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This follows from a proposal prepared by the ministry.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns on support for the armed forces.
According to its authors, the basic goal of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the performance of military service and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of amateur radio, shooters or cynologists and would make it possible to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, it would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the country in times of crisis if necessary, and on their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It is also planned to organize discussions with war veterans or people who behaved heroically.
One of the possible options assumes that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state would use their abilities only after the state of threat has been declared.
&quot;The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between the various types of threats,&quot; the plan said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Minister officials noted that it was therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just military ones.
&quot;The basic goal of the plan is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond in a qualified manner to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or lives, health and property, protect themselves, or contribute to the protection of others, and misconduct not make it difficult for the Czech Armed Forces.&quot; states the intention.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office expects financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination center were established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
Additional money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of regional military headquarters would have to be expanded, which would employ a total of another 42 soldiers.
Representatives of the ministry have previously stated that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the implementation of the European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but did not find a suitable survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And despite promising anonymity to the survey, some employees expressed distrust in the whole process.
&quot;I was looking for consistency and objectivity,&quot; said Errett, owner of the San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help from outside.
New startups in the field of human resources are constantly appearing on the market, which help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intent of measuring employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to vote quickly, target specific teams and demographics, offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass superiors and contact directors directly. .
&quot;There are tools on the market like Diet and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?&quot; Said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reintwood-based Glint.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she had gained greater awareness in three years of what her employees thought and felt.
In addition to quick surveys and voting by specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a brief overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - allowing the user to work on redress.
Companies are beginning to realize the need to pay attention to the culture of the work environment - in case they become another Uber - which is reeling in scandals after a former employee posted a blog post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let&#39;s Talk Payments, a technical and financial advancement website, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $ 118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year, just ahead of the Uber scandals.
Convercent&#39;s nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber also took under his wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable &quot;flash&quot; surveys, gather confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the CEO is involved in a problem, complaints are sent directly to the board.
&quot;The Court of Public Opinion has empowered regulators,&quot; said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behavior - and if regulators do not intervene - it can face costly consequences due to customer boycotts, employee exhaustion or litigation, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain, which employs more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employee awareness of company policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to find a phone number or e-mail to the company&#39;s management, formally file a complaint, and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a daunting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday&#39;s general manager, who said there was no reliable way to track employee complaints before.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it quickly provides detection and resolution of issues that have never before reached managers in offices miles away from actually resolving complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
&quot;It&#39;s close to a holistic, overall view of employees&#39; experiences,&quot; said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday&#39;s risk management group.
&quot;At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees.&quot;
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm, collapsed after the fall of Enron over the abuse of employees&#39; ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But it wasn&#39;t until &quot;social media shed light on the whole thing&quot; that companies began to realize that in the online world, they couldn&#39;t simply hide their skeletons in a closet.
&quot;Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith,&quot; Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by brave capital investors, supported by both startups.
As part of its February campaign, Convercent raised a total of $ 10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually raised $ 47 million in capital.
Glint received $ 10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and received $ 60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing body of research clearly confirms that today&#39;s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are not the main advantages.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and appreciated and that they dedicate their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
&quot;When people are happy with their work, they feel that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the company&#39;s success,&quot; said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits for LinkedIn at Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money when companies thrive and companies prosper when their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool emerges in the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it&#39;s no wonder there are plenty of investors to support this effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, major changes can occur.
And if change doesn&#39;t happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest in employees.
&quot;Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations,&quot; said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies relying too much on the data itself.
“Because as soon as you don&#39;t finish things, the employees start asking themselves, &#39;Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care? &#39;&quot;&quot;
Madison Reed, which now conducts employee surveys on a regular monthly basis, can solve the problem within a day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and begin communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining an important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high long-term employment in an industry known for frequent redundancies.
&quot;If you do not strive to create a transparent work environment, employees will not trust you,&quot; Vitrano added.
&quot;And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt. ”
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region.
It thus overcame Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute informed about it.
Compared to Tuesday, Thursday, however, did not set many temperature records.
The heat hit mainly Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equaled at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, in Strážnice, today&#39;s temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region, today&#39;s 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
Today, high temperatures appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the greatest heat was in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in the Břeclav region, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, today&#39;s highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
&quot;Temperatures there started to rise only later in the afternoon,&quot; meteorologists said.
According to the CHMI, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and heavier rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We have such a scandal here.
For billionaires, the same vote in elections is not enough for every adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as rude as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta, Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water, Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejšek&#39;s Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupt and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta won the Private Party.
The Agrofert political movement, as the mayor of Kroměříž, Jaroslav Němec, inadvertently named the project of Andrej Babiš, is a chapter in itself.
The Mayors also recently caught their billionaire.
He is Dalibor Dědek, the owner of the company for security equipment Jablotron.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
However, Entrée in the mayor&#39;s jersey did not do very well.
&quot;I&#39;ve never dreamed of small goals,&quot; he told a news conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement to win the Mayors movement with twenty percent in the elections.
Many smiled.
But my grandfather&#39;s argument is rather characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor Dědek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for the votes of voters in the Mayors&#39; jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
My old man supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
&quot;Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not have a pleasing rhetoric of political snakes,&quot; he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But he definitely doesn&#39;t go into politics because he wants to improve himself personally.
For me, Babiš will remain a hero.
He is willing to step out of his world under his control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said that he wanted the Mayors to learn to imagine a possible cooperation with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that the Old Man does not change his mind and stands behind him no matter what jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babiš sends someone so clumsy to the Mayors to build his flat.
Others may ask whether the head of Jablotron, for example, did not break up with the head of Agrofert in a bad way and is not looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
However, Dědek&#39;s first public appearances did not revolve only around Babiš.
The old man promised to send the Mayors ten million crowns for the campaign.
And when they say they need more money, they&#39;ll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been difficult for anyone to pause over a similar statement.
After all, the court-recognized crook Zdeněk Bakala scattered millions to all parties before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and the Civic Democrats came together for almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
As the Old Man enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe then he wouldn&#39;t have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation in our country.
Dědek crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for tax benefits for families with studied children.
People with a university degree come to about fifty thousand a month with us.
Those with a base of less than twenty.
A man of fifty thousand is rich in local conditions.
The one with twenty poor.
In Grandpa&#39;s vision of society, the poor pay taxes fairly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of the welfare state, in the running of which they do not participate much.
In short, it is necessary to help the rich not to overcome misery with need.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš rubbed his hands.
Thanks to Dědek, the rest of us can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question then remains, who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members of their party or citizens of the state do not have as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want all people, not just some, to live well in a rich country.
Nobody wanted Trump&#39;s paradise.
The villa complex had to become cheaper by 234 million.
Selling real estate is sometimes not easy.
And often not even 11 bedrooms, a beautiful sea view, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump will help him.
The sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex dropped by an incredible £ 8 million.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says of the property, &quot;Sincerely, Donald J. Trump.&quot;
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the merger of the real estate company with the American president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean headquarters by an incredible £ 8 million.
The original price of the property was £ 21.5 million, the final price fell to £ 13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And no wonder.
A stunning 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The plot also includes a swimming pool and tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the plot.
The terrace has a beautiful sea view.
According to real estate experts, the price was reflected in the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to current real estate prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around £ 15 million.
He had to buy the property for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new price, however, it ranks second.
The neighborhood property was valued at £ 13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end two workouts a day. Long days come for the Bruins
It&#39;s eleven in the morning and UCLA football players are squeezing at the side line of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, an unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most team members, these few minutes of doing nothing replaces a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will leave the rooms after three hours of training to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting the following morning at 6:30.
&quot;The next three days will be a real cat for these boys,&quot; said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday&#39;s swing on Tuesday.
By eliminating two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to relieve the players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That&#39;s why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. - to cram into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora has spent as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp begins a week earlier than last year and training is limited during the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of workouts from two to one per day also has an impact on this.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled until August 20, after which formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&amp;M team, which takes place in September, begin.
Mora has been rumored to support the NCAA&#39;s decision, despite adding another item to the players&#39; already busy diary.
&quot;For three or four days, the players are under a lot of stress and it&#39;s very exhausting for them,&quot; Mora said.
&quot;But no one gave up, everyone is trying. They are great.
I think that on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down. &quot;
UCLA will be closed after the training camp, which will not be easy looking at the clear lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center Hotel, which was occupied by players after harvesting the safety net behind the goal post.
The Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that there may be a problem once the rooms are empty during the season.
&quot;The land will be guarded by the security service,&quot; Mora added.
&quot;Safety is taken care of, but it is possible that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
Such material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe that everything will turn out well.
Everything is planned. &quot;
Facebook plans to check the facts more closely to reduce the number of fake messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties for review and display findings below the original posts in an effort to combat so-called &quot;fake news,&quot; the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results below the original contributions.
Facebook has been described as one of the main sources of false news, and many believe that this unconfirmed news influenced last year&#39;s election of the President of the United States.
There are political debates in Europe about the whole issue. French voters are inundated with avalanche of false reports of the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September elections if it does not quickly remove angry contributions.
Facebook said in a statement issued in Germany on Thursday that it planned to launch testing of a new fake message control feature in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
&quot;In addition to viewing third-party verified messages, people want more content to be better informed and to make the right decisions about what they can share,&quot; said Sara Su, Facebook&#39;s news product manager, on her blog.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the &quot;related articles&quot; feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
Creating a graphic short story: the story of A Castle in England
The small Scotney Castle recently starred in Squeeze&#39;s music video, and Margaret Thatcher also found refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
However, from his cozy spot on the River Bewl in Kent, UK, Scotney witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history that inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
&quot;The sight of the script of a man 300 years after death fascinates me,&quot; Rhodes says with a serious face.
&quot;When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.&quot;
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages until the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not Rhodes&#39; first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men&#39;s Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by British Library documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
&quot;I was fascinated by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites,&quot; he said.
&quot;It&#39;s his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I sniff the letter now, 300 years later, it&#39;s like I&#39;m going back in time.
How I love the archives! ”
For someone so fascinated by old papers, support from the National Trust and the Arts Council England and being able to stay in a castle for almost four months is almost like a dream. (&quot;To tell you the truth, I extended my stay a little.&quot;)
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian &quot;new&quot; castle, browsing archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on a wall and bottles that had been thrown into a ditch for centuries.
He walked around the grounds, exploring the ruins of an old castle, talking to gamekeepers, gardeners, and occasionally artists working on illustrations for his book.
At night he &quot;drank whiskey and wrote.&quot;
Scotney&#39;s confidential history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, employees were just beginning to break into the archives, which Rhodes described as &quot;aristocrats for many centuries are throwing up their hands with the words, &#39;Take it to the attic.&#39;&quot;
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps showing property: &quot;You may think the land dispute is boring,&quot; Rhodes said, &quot;but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a birch tree.&quot;
Leave it to the people! ”
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a stepping stone and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Laborer, who follows a man leaving a newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
&quot;I found a record of a revolt at the castle in 1380, which was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book,&quot; Rhodes said.
&quot;The English uprising actually started in this area and it occurred to me that the uprising was a good starting point.
Maybe they&#39;re somehow connected in the end. &quot;
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle - such as The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell&#39;s family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral while filling a coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes&#39; favorite family is the Darrells: &quot;I was fascinated by the male generation - the men of that time were always in debt and spent money on things they could not afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family have solved this by marrying rich or old mistresses - I imagine that they were handsome gentlemen who liked to bother the heirs. &quot;
At the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stunt in the Finnish wilderness, drawing inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was swallowed up by nature.
But it&#39;s a special place for Scotney.
&quot;I was sad when I left,&quot; he said.
&quot;I thought, &#39;Now, I&#39;m going to go back to real life.&#39;&quot;
Washington is changing the conditions for granting a green card
The media published the words of President Donald Trump about the new US immigration plan, which will also include a change in the award of green cards.
The number of legal immigrants is thus expected to fall by 50,000 year on year due to stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
New rules are being proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
&quot;This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers. We will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will favor English-speaking applicants who are rich in financial resources and demonstrate skills that will benefit our country, &quot;said Trump, quoted by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be careful
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report appeared on the Internet about the technological development of sex robots.
Yes.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots must be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of their eyes, the shape of their nipples and the appearance of the robot&#39;s nails.
&quot;People are pulling on them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often,&quot; Sharkey said at the news.
Modern sexual aids are changing from inflatable men to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, artificial intelligence, which mimics human behavior.
The user can &quot;adjust&quot; the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
Very worrying, however, is the fact that many robots have their own &quot;personality&quot; that would embarrass even the Stepford mistress.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of a RealBotix robot can set various character traits for his surrogate wife, including shyness.
And then there&#39;s True Companion&#39;s Roxxxy Gold sex robotic woman, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the &quot;frigid Farrah,&quot; who has a shy nature, and the &quot;wild Wendy,&quot; who has an &quot;adventurous&quot; nature.
&quot;Roxxxy Gold&#39;s personality is set up to suit your personality as much as possible,&quot; the True Companion website said.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
It&#39;s even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or &quot;in the mood.&quot;
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - not to mention confusion with real interpersonal relationships. Worrying are the rather inferior female character traits and violent allusions - such as the frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
True Companion likens Roxxxy to a male vibrator on its website.
&quot;If a woman can have a vibrator, why can&#39;t a man have Roxxxy?&quot; The page says.
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their origin and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or gender equality to the desire for captivating sex with an optional surcharge.
Most men, of course, don&#39;t buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of general public interest.
However, this marginal interest may become a mirror set in modern times.
And most people are not geeky or violent until the free market is used as an excuse.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights and a president is sitting in the White House, who often speaks very derogatoryly about women.
The most terrifying aspect of The Maid&#39;s Tale is not what we see - hung bodies and hollowed out eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The book The Servant&#39;s Story is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should look as much as possible to real women (albeit with the degrees of a porn actress).
Their creators design them so that they are pleasant to the touch and look at first glance like a real woman.
However, when it comes to their &quot;personality&quot;, the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can&#39;t break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history. Nothing that would stimulate their independence or undermine their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
21st Century Speech: The Maid.
NBA star on a green arm.
Curry is fighting in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not get lost during the premiere start among professional golfers, despite the botched first shot.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player won the first round of 74 shots at the Ellie Mae Classic in the lower series Web.com Tour in Hayward, California and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously and his first shot ended in a drink holder in a golf cart parked by the fairway.
Even then, although he was not as accurate between the holes as under the basketball hoop, he still left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four shots above par.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t the perfect way to start, having to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it got a little saddle,&quot; Curry said, adding that he was terribly frightened.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot of the tournament, but that was all I hoped for.
&quot;If you told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would take it immediately,&quot; he added.
If Curry manages to fight his way through a cut that is likely to be two shots below par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
&quot;I want to play better next time and now that I&#39;ve got rid of my fear, it will work,&quot; said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
He starts in Hayward for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
He received a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump&#39;s big victory?
Mitt Romney, on the other hand, is the embodiment of common sense
The political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro scale, disrupt entire families, are becoming an unmistakable feature of the Trump era.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers were full of advice on how to deal with relatives who elect Trump.
Reportedly, we&#39;re just waiting for it to let go of our nerves.
However, less attention is paid to Trump&#39;s ability to unite the family.
I&#39;m talking about this because my cousin, a poet and fan of the left, who lives in Chicago and who has been paying a Republican fool in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that closeness to a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly the whole family - including all the Republican siblings with whom they had been arguing about politics for many years - is on the same track.
It&#39;s a good thing at dinner at the family table; but it amazes me that in a broader context, this poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about &quot;normalization&quot; and Trump, we refer to the frightening possibility that his clowns may one day lose their attractiveness.
However, there is an even more gruesome long-term scenario in which Trump &quot;normalizes&quot; right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these, today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which seem very mild compared to Trump. offenses.
After Trump&#39;s departure, it is enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a huge improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin&#39;s visit and took the children to Central Park on the largest carousel run by the New York Department of Parks - you won&#39;t find a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the center cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals shoot and stare at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy look and the clinking music is strangely reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés will soon get bored: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama looks out, instead of breathing in the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn&#39;t get over the fact that Swiss Cottage was not really Swiss cheese - not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub - but a London Underground station.
However, the carousel in Central Park evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the point that two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, have great fun.
If I could evaluate the carousel, he would deserve maximum points. Fortunately, no one asks.
This week, I had a similar experience in a store when I was asked to rate my &quot;experience&quot; on a scale of one to five when paying by credit card.
In a cafe on the corner of my street, it&#39;s the same, with the difference that I can add a 15% tip to the rating for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does this slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is thus forced to interfere with shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile as I reluctantly rated my five-card credit card transfer.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts on his wrists, which, according to the prison, he caused himself after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder on appeal against the original sentence for manslaughter.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine&#39;s Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the toilet cabinet door in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken her for a thief.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius&#39; six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority has said it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces up to 15 years in prison.
The death penalty does not apply in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a young captive-bred panda gave birth, which mated in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of captive-bred pandas.
A worker at the Zhang Chung Center told the New China Agency that panda breeding posed a high risk due to inbreeding.
At the end of last year, only 471 pandas lived in captivity.
Only two thousand of them survive in the wild.
Trying to pair captured pandas with wild ones is the first step in helping panda breeding help protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Chao-chao was released into a nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on March 11.
Thanks to a tracking device on her neck, the scientists were able to observe her every step.
She met Chao-chao her chosen one 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with a male panda lasted a minute and a half and ended successfully.
This too can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males estimate relatively poorly when the female is ready, and they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, the statement was quoted by bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by Sithonian police on the morning of August 1.
All were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and impose severe fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Inspections will take place throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková is in a split 50th place after the first round of the British Open major.
The course at Kingsbarns in Scotland bypassed the score one stroke below par when she birded three times and bogeyed twice.
The 22-year-old Czech player thus hopes to go through the cut for the first time on the famous major.
The entry into the competition with a subsidy of $ 3.25 million came best for the American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the course record of 64 shots, ie eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands alone has already temporarily closed 180 poultry houses due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch food safety authority NVWA has announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which means that 80 percent of eggs on the market are safe.
The Office emphasized that the risk was posed by only a limited number of types of eggs, identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Petr SVer, a spokesman for the Czech SVS, said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also started closing farms, have not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians shall take random samples of eggs and chicken originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, where problematic insecticide brands have appeared on the markets.
According to the veterinary administration, eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is often used in preparations against fleas, lice and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers the preparation to be mildly toxic.
Its high doses lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for an engagement.
I still want to catch ten years.
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll be back one day,&quot; smiled 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in a Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement until the start of the new year.
What were the four years you had like in Latvia?
If I had to evaluate it as at school, for three.
The first year I didn&#39;t catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was learning.
The second year I started fishing.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought a new goalkeeper, with whom I took turns again.
Last year, I assumed I would still catch.
But during the first ten matches, we only got five points, so the coaches started spinning.
In the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that&#39;s how it&#39;s done.
They wanted to play him for next season.
What was life like in Riga?
Splendid.
It is a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I will miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We are together for the third year, we will get married next year.
So I brought something.
How challenging is the KHL to goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I did not see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty-handed.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
After all, there is more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn&#39;t traveling and moving through seven time zones a problem for you?
If you don&#39;t have a family, it&#39;s not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually made by playing, for example, four matches outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians perceive their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
Everyone cheers.
Even though it was not successful, a lot of people went.
Did Dinam&#39;s presence in the KHL help Latvia almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year&#39;s World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since then, their World Cup results have started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell just 1: 2 in the quarterfinals with Canada.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL, they reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech extra league.
Roberts Bukarts made his mark in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is ahead of the contract.
Why are there so many of them coming here?
They are not B-players, they are really high quality.
The local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It&#39;s a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still out of engagement?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they did not have a budget for the goalkeeper, we did not agree.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the final they decided on someone else.
So I&#39;m training at home in Zlín and I&#39;ll wait for something to appear.
Aren&#39;t you nervous about it?
That was four years ago when I left and didn&#39;t know what would happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I am at home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I take it differently.
The only question is when and where will I sign.
How realistic is the option of starting a new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We&#39;ll see what happens in a month, where things turn out.
Now I can only wait for the agent to speak.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season was not such for me to choose.
So I&#39;m waiting for the phone.
The government flight at Let continues.
In January of this year, I am in the article With the care of a proper manager? he wrote, among other things, about the camp in Lety near Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I would like to recall the key passages of the article.
The camp in Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is about, it will probably be best to look, for example, at the official website of the cultural monument Pietní místo Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, they learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a concentration camp and from 2 August 1942 it became a gypsy camp. .
The following text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first air prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp by the largest transport.
There were a total of 420 of them.
A very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings, which in turn was caused to them by human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no doubt that it is necessary to constantly remember these events.
There is no doubt that the commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somehow forgotten, and in the 1970s, a pigsty was built near and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the pigsty, but this has not yet happened.
In 1998, the memorial was declared a cultural monument, and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pigsty.
So very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pigsty and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the piggery.
According to Culture Minister Herman, &quot;there are some numbers, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them.&quot;
We&#39;ll see what an expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Anyway, it will by no means be a cheap affair.
At the same time, only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a memorial, in the renovation of which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was beautifully funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which does not seem to be a threat, I think it would still be a waste of money.
Doesn&#39;t the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified place of reverence, stands by the will of history in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and whoever wants can pay homage to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let us leave it as it is, and let us maintain the place of reverence with the utmost care.
The responsible person, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should treat the entrusted property, ie also the taxpayers&#39; money, with the care of a proper manager.
At least with one, as in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above facts, I perceive the motto of the leader of the YES movement only as empty pre-election proclamations.
In May this year, I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, modified parking, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exposition, in the other an integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own place of reverence, which is made of stones placed on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as befits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently being carried out on the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would not be possible to preserve, for example, part of the exposed foundations and at least make them accessible in a suitable manner.
Culture Minister Daniel Herman could step up his efforts in this direction.
If he manages to enforce the purchase of a pigsty for state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already quite problematic work as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare for your digestive system.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps build immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
Study leader dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the weighing pans are tilted to the side of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
In the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the tolerance of the body in the stomach of mice with a specific bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins, to make cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between one type of bacterium - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that support the body&#39;s tolerance.
The more tryptophan their diets had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had. ”
He also suggested that if the same were shown to be true in humans, then the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postgraduate researcher dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas discovered in a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice kept separately lacked cells.
She deduced from this that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that commonly reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The gut of the mice was tested by DNA sequencing, and the researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the second group of mice lacked.
Mice that were housed in a sterile environment and lacked an intestinal microbiome — so they did not develop this type of immune cell — were given L. reuteri — and developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells, which were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the fluid, it has been shown to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of the mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, the number of cells dropped by half after halving the doses of tryptophan.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but tryptophan-related gene defects have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: &quot;Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells, because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase cell populations. ”
José Mourinho considers the signing of a contract with Nemanj Matić and his transfer to Manchester United to be &#39;brilliant&#39;
Manchester United added a &quot;genius&quot; to their team in the form of Nemanj Matić - at least that&#39;s what José Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday&#39;s match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a £ 40m contract, made the first match with a 2: 1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and acted as midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not take part in the team pre-season Asian tour, Matić was out of shape and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinh, needs to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
&quot;He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mindset - he thinks football,&quot; Mourinho said.
&quot;We&#39;ll help him get in shape as soon as possible.&quot;
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his 11th for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists the club has done a &quot;fantastic job&quot; and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
&quot;I thank the club for helping me get three out of four players,&quot; he added.
&quot;Four out of four would make me happier, but I admit they did their best for me.&quot;
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins Láda Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
That promising picture began to take shape thanks to a new TV show at the Prima Zdeněk Academy.
Pear immediately ventured the chance.
&quot;Dear Zdeněk, I would like to enroll in your cooking academy, because, hand on heart, I think I can learn a lot from you,&quot; he challenged him in a video on the social network.
And because the two have been topping themselves for several years, Lada did not forget to irritate him this time as well.
&quot;In return, I can teach you Znojmo from diet chicken, American cucumber or invite you to the water and show you why fried cheese is popular,&quot; Hruška said.
He really takes his participation in Pohlreich&#39;s new show seriously.
It&#39;s time to move up a level and learn from the master.
&quot;The question is, what does the boss do,&quot; he told Blesk.
But Pohlreich did not comment because he was shooting new episodes of his next show, Yes, boss !.
Only Prima reacted to Hruška&#39;s participation in the culinary academy, saying that she took the whole affair as his personal activity, which goes outside of television.
Hruška dealt a big blow to Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
Over 300,000 pieces were sold to her in a few days!
The new show, which Prima presented at a press conference on the autumn broadcasting scheme yesterday, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve culinary techniques in twelve episodes.
In the last part of his show Now the Boss is Cooking in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed-out pear ironed on the back of his T-shirt.
If he had my face there, I would laugh a lot.
&quot;I&#39;ll just smile at the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins,&quot; Lada responded.
He thinks about Lada&#39;s culinary art.
&quot;According to Láda Hruška, cooking is not even possible at home, because I won&#39;t let go of gastropunk home,&quot; the boss is clear.
I respect Zdeněk Pohlreich very much, according to him I even make chicken on honey.
But his recipes will definitely not appear on my show, &quot;Hruška did not forgive himself.
He&#39;s an idiot!
He&#39;s not a chef to me, he&#39;s a TV clown.
&quot;A gastronomic illiterate or moron,&quot; Pohlreich said of Hrušek at a lecture.
&quot;I&#39;m not twenty to be able to wave my hand over them, but I&#39;m not dealing with them that way either,&quot; Hruška said on account of the insults.
The British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and a house with a wave
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the doors to the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with the help of technology.
The implantation procedure and adherence to treatment procedures are supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam&#39;s company also offers a microchip-compatible door and car lock replacement service. The price of one lock is £ 300.
The married father of one child had the technology integrated into his house and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
The White House props cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House&#39;s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry last month was $ 24,000, according to Navy records released by TIME.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the culmination of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a showcase of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials watched a display of products from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a fork lift truck from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an &quot;emergency&quot;, according to Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1).
&quot;I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant incident,&quot; Commander HMX-1 wrote in an email to his superior, Deputy Chief of the Air Force the day before the incident.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive in South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. on the occasion of the show, which is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. 00.
The e-mail also stated that if there was a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for the return flight due to working time regulations.
The original crew remained in place that evening, along with a helicopter and a security unit.
From the records - obtained by the weekly TIME - it was not clear whether the second crew was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
&quot;We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were assured that everything was in order,&quot; the commander wrote.
&quot;Sounds like you&#39;ve been blocked,&quot; the deputy commander replied.
This &quot;Made in America&quot; show was designated an official event by the White House, so the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political overtones.
During his participation in the event, the president promoted the health care reform, which went through the senate, and spoke of the effort to keep government regulations in check.
The use of aircraft such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after a presidential plane flew in the background at his first rally as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is flooded with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
&quot;The White House is pleased with the &#39;Made in America&#39; show, which featured products from all 50 countries made by Americans from American materials,&quot; said Lindsay Walters, the deputy secretary of the press.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington and South Lawn areas and practice possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the crew&#39;s current training, a government official said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew another eleven hours as part of &quot;non-presidential support missions&quot;.
The White House said no additional props were paid for taxpayers&#39; money.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was in no way interested in negotiations to display a helicopter on South Lawn.
The HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the show is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, the reimbursement of DoD expenses for VH-3D is $ 24,380 per flight hour.
The unit&#39;s records show a time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of a helicopter are well below that amount.
&quot;It is very misleading to state taxpayers&#39; costs based on cost estimates,&quot; Walters said of the matter.
&quot;These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs, which are included in the annual costs.&quot;
According to the 2015 RAND study, reimbursement of DoD expenses does not include staff costs, but includes fuel costs, maintenance and contract costs.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of a helicopter for the show&#39;s purposes.
&quot;The idea of the show, which takes place this week, is to introduce products made in the USA,&quot; said Spicer.
&quot;I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that they provide work for hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities that count countless Americans.
It is appropriate to recall this fact. &quot;
It&#39;s not clear if Trump was to look at the helicopter during his tour of South Lawn. The only thing that can be said for sure is that he got behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump addressed a Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
&quot;I know Sikorsky very well,&quot; said the president, &quot;I own three myself.&quot;
A young woman got stuck in a swamp by Macha Lake, the police waded to her.
The girl set out for the beach on Sunday around two o&#39;clock in the morning.
Instead of swimming, however, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask a police officer for help on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
&quot;Because of this, the police soon lost contact with her,&quot; said police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková.
Several police patrols set out for the place she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
&quot;Some of the policemen had to wade through the reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt solid ground under their feet again,&quot; Baláková said.
And similarly, she was missing.
The police focused on the direction from which her call for help was coming.
&quot;In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count down aloud,&quot; the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman in three quarters to five in the swamps in the Borný locality.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
Therefore, an ambulance called her to the hospital in Českolipská.
Grandpa&#39;s connection with STAN?
The desired bride becomes a sales girl.
That&#39;s a little ironic.
With his web project hledameslusny.cz, it seems as if a billionaire was basically telling voters that STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
He also confirmed that a politically disparate group of rather lesser-known mayors and independent ones actually has no nationwide program for parliamentary elections.
Her interview candidate will simply become a decent person, no matter what political opinion, after an interview with the Old Man.
Vít Bárta used to start like this and it didn&#39;t turn out very well.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities, who may replace some mayors as candidates, as Gazdík admitted, Dědek also cancels the popular argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement are politically proven and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians and according to surveys.
They will now be easily replaced by hastily collected unknown personalities.
Gazdík also explained the total break with the People&#39;s Party, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity among the People&#39;s Party candidates.
But if STAN suspected only of identity at that time, after the arrival of the Old Man, the mere game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long opposed ANO Andrej Babiš, but in the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, stated as follows: &quot;My goal is for the ANO movement, ie the Mayors movement, to get twenty percent in the upcoming elections.&quot;
Let&#39;s hope he didn&#39;t confuse the movement.
An old man is a successful businessman and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics in the same way as Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
For some time now, STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Dědek&#39;s helping hand seems to make the desired bride even more of a sales girl.
For a while STAN went with TOP 09, then with the People&#39;s Party and now he is looking for decent people for a change.
Let&#39;s hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs practiced helicopter flights in Most
Explosives search dogs and search dogs were practicing helicopter flights at Lake Most today.
A police dog must not be timid and afraid of flying, said Petr Tomášek, the head of police cynologists in the Ústí nad Labem region.
Training a police dog takes about two years.
Both adult trained dogs and those who are just undergoing training trained at Most.
In addition to standard training to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for a lost helper, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in a helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work so that he does not have a problem with the journey by helicopter.
&quot;The helicopter lands, the dog goes and immediately searches,&quot; said Tomášek.
A dog that is restless or is unable to start working immediately on the way by helicopter is excluded from training.
&quot;Usually, the handlers keep them, for example, in the garden,&quot; Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs in the Ústí nad Labem region with various specializations.
German shepherds predominate, but there are also more Belgian shepherds.
The handler takes care of him from the puppy.
&quot;He raises him himself, he prepares him for the service that the dog will do for us,&quot; added Tomášek.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which may reveal possible health disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and timid, he passes the first test in 20 months.
&quot;He gets into a sharp hit in about two and a half to three years,&quot; Tomášek added.
The length of service with the police depends on the health of the dog.
It usually serves within eight to ten years.
They usually live with their handlers.
Trailer for Season 3 Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of the Netflix hit series
Despite the end of Narcos&#39; second season, when Pablo Escobar&#39;s killer is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service - the former has already received the first trailer and an outline of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godparents, they operate &quot;like a Fortune 500 company,&quot; with the only difference being that they intensify acts of violence and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connections with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian drug law enforcement.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will have its premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The election can only be credible if it is attended by all members of society, including women, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the UN Relief Mission, said hundreds of women were running in local elections, three women were running for vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters were women.
&quot;The role of women cannot be ignored,&quot; he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate, as well as all related election-related processes.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are being held on April 5.
The Taliban has issued several threats against the electoral process, which is moving international combat activity to the forefront.
In this year&#39;s elections, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government transfers its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said the strong role of women would strengthen Afghanistan&#39;s democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million were women.
The unique brewery brews beer again.
For a good beer in a resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobča u Mšen back to life a few years ago.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was rebuilt into steam-engine operation in the nineteenth century.
Years of prosperity followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during the Second World War, production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served as a state farm.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, new hope shone in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzový.
They began to repair buildings with maximum respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They have been and continue to study archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same appearance as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was recognized by the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture, and the building also became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, they also ceremoniously renewed the tradition of brewing beer.
If you want to taste great Lobeč beer in the picturesque landscape of the Kokořín region, visit the bar in the brewery complex.
When brewing beer, they use Kokorin water springing in a protected landscape area, malt from Lobeč fields and Satu Mare hops.
In the bar you can taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And don&#39;t miss a tour of the brewery, which takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and half past one.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind in the world?
Such a unique building was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, at the top of the ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by a large underground.
There was to be the headquarters, barracks, ammunition depots, supplies, power plant, engine room and hospital.
However, the construction was completed by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, the only massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and the underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also see it here.
The underground is already accessible from 75 percent!
In addition to the TS 73 infantry cabin with an exposition and underground, the area also includes an armed light fortification building, as well as two infantry cabins under construction, trenches and the Fortified Trutnovsko nature trail.
Refreshments, a cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been included in the list next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Trajan&#39;s Port near Rome or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chotěšov Monastery was originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building above a beautiful garden.
The list he got on, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of extinction.
But enthusiasts do not want to give up and organize a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next year&#39;s Dinner for the Chotěšov Monastery this Saturday, August 5, where Vladimír Mišík and Ivan Hlas will perform, see fencing performances and look at the places of a beautiful large building, which are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free Pl @ ntNet application will help students with herbarium creation and ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in which plant they just came across on the walk, this application will advise them.
All they have to do is take a photo of the plant and the app will recognize the species.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Center for Ethical and Environmental Education in Bratislava&#39;s Mountain Park as part of the Secret City Life project.
Pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also took part in the project, taking photos with teachers to the application database and adding plants from their surroundings.
The newly created French application is free to download on the Secret City Life website.
The main goal of the French programmers was for as many people as possible to contribute their images to the application, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
&quot;Even children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hand can go to the forest,&quot; said Ivana Poláčková, the coordinator of this project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photograph of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which it then assigns below the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute a snapshot of a plant that does not yet exist in the database after creating an account in the application.
&quot;The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial, and then add it to the database,&quot; Poláčková informed.
GMB&#39;s concerns about investing in McVitie&#39;s plant in Glasgow
The unions are demanding reassurances from the biscuit maker McVitie&#39;s managers about the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent about a possible investment in a factory in the Tollcross area.
The factory has more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
McVitie&#39;s owner, Pladis, said it had invested more than £ 5 million in the region over the past few years.
She added that employees and union representatives will be &quot;among the first informed&quot; in the event of changes in the plant&#39;s operations.
In a letter to the company&#39;s construction manager, GMB&#39;s Scottish unions expressed their concern that McVitie&#39;s &quot;would not deliver on its promises to finance and modernize production lines.&quot;
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we did not receive a clear response from the construction manager about the company&#39;s needs and the future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and the staff come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in a local factory is a critical pillar of decent work in an area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of labor, wages and benefits - and despite the outlook for Brexit, rising living costs and declining slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie&#39;s. &quot;
A Pladis spokeswoman said: &quot;Construction manager Tollcross did not receive a letter from GMB until yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago, and many issues were openly discussed at the meeting.
We spoke to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested £ 5 million in the Tollcross area, mainly in production lines and streamlining operations.
We really appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the locality, and in the event of any changes in the operation of the local factory, employees and trade union representatives will be informed immediately. &quot;
Did PSG warn Barcelona about relocating Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymara to join Neymar after depositing £ 189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona of its record-breaking raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer stirred up the waters of summer transfers. Ligue 1 is set to break more than double the previous record for Paul Pogby&#39;s move to Manchester United, which paid £ 89 million for it last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world - after tax, he will receive over £ 500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar got out of his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
&quot;I&#39;m not afraid, because if someone tries to get one of our players, we will definitely contact one of their players,&quot; Al-Khelaifi said.
&quot;We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences. &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary border when it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that it will not allow the Italian representative to leave under any circumstances. It is therefore possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for its bold actions with the departure of Neymar.
Who explains the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broad rules?
Donald Trump nodded at the anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And the day before, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything with the North Korean threat and that it will not go on like this.
This also gives rise to the idea of sanctions like straw from shoes.
You can&#39;t throw those things in one bag.
Madur&#39;s Venezuela really set out on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not just behaving as the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even an ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, can understand what it is and what system of rules the sanctions policy is based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump only tightens what President Obama has already prepared, only gives him an execution stamp.
So why such a commotion?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the US election, he would hug Putin and lift sanctions.
Terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not relaxed, but tightened.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German Minister Zypries says Trump&#39;s sanctions violate international law.
Is it that kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian sanctions in the EU.
European Commission chief Juncker is complaining that Trump&#39;s sanctions threaten the EU&#39;s energy security.
Is it as if sanctions should be applied only so weak that they do not endanger anyone?
An ordinary voter is groping.
He had heard for three years that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
He now learns that this is about the EU&#39;s energy security.
The voter is groping even wider.
Russia is being sanctioned for mounting too much where it does not.
China is being rumored for not being assembled.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country&#39;s borders.
All those punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see this as a system, order or rule?
Andrej Babiš: I&#39;m not thinking about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, cruised the republic with his visionary book and finalized the election program.
Apart from the Pardubice Region, it has already completed all the candidates.
According to him, he did not interfere significantly in them.
He even agreed that the Moravian-Silesian one should be led by the governor and shadow minister of education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
&quot;But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a deputy or a governor,&quot; Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You have annoyed many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should manage municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn&#39;t like that.
I am in favor of direct democracy, we elect the president directly and I believe that we should elect mayors and mayors as well.
I&#39;m not talking about disturbing the deputies in my book, they can easily be there.
The question is how many there will be.
During the presentation of your book What I dream about, when I happen to sleep, I heard with my own ears that you talked about the abolition of councils.
I don&#39;t remember that.
I talked about direct election and reducing the number of deputies.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1,171 representatives.
And the mayor is accused of building little and not preparing large projects, but she has no competence for that.
The same is true of a government run by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say that they did well.
However, the current prime minister does not lead anything, he only moderates the debate.
That&#39;s not how it works.
Is that why you want to enforce a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it&#39;s hard to push through.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a rolling mandate for ministers and an amendment to the Rules of Procedure of the House in order to avoid unnecessary exhibitions by Members who are to work mainly in commissions and committees, not to appear at House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that&#39;s exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the House of Commons with 101 deputies, abolish the regions and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors you will control the whole country.
Certainly not.
After all, there is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 French people per legislator, while in our country it is based on 17,000 Czechs.
However, no one accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone wins the election by a majority in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms in place to prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
The temptations for those who have a parliamentary majority are great, just look to Poland or Hungary.
There is no danger of such a thing in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team that will work in government for the people, not for their parties or departments.
I do not understand, for example, why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, cultural workers and social services will increase.
Why did they outvote me and add 21 percent to the GIBS members, who are already taking 60,000?
Would you step on that as prime minister?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency, and for the state&#39;s money they would like to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers should not argue in the government, they should discuss their differences outside it.
The finished material must go to the cabinet, there is no room for coalition rifts, power voting and business, there is to be decided there.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers behave mainly partyly?
The constitutional law is above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply, and expelled Babiš from the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has managerial abilities, he does not need such empty gestures.
It measures the same for everyone and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you already know who you would nominate for Minister of Finance?
I don&#39;t think about it at all, because we probably won&#39;t be in that government, nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don&#39;t know what I did so terribly.
So much skepticism is out of place.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur Dědek, who would like to cooperate with you, and the wing of the pro-Jiří Čunek may win for the People&#39;s Party.
I do not think so.
The CSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO; Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose it, may prevail in the ODS.
I would leave it to the voters.
YO Deputy Prime Minister and Vice President Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the Poorites are eligible as a coalition partner?
Mr Brabec claims he did not say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of Vít Bárta for VV, then he got money for his company from Úsvit, a coup took place there.
He is, of course, a strong personality.
But a little brownish.
If I take his program, there he has a broad involvement of people in the management of society, a direct democracy, one can agree with that.
I&#39;m not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views, speaks at gallows demonstrations and wants to leave the EU, is acceptable to you?
We are not considering working with Mr Okamura&#39;s party, I cannot imagine it.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
And what about the tacit support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can&#39;t even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in line, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be second.
Of course, it is important that they be able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let&#39;s go back to your efforts to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow it, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, he never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was also the reason why he fired me.
As soon as he did so, CEZ took control of the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by CEZ&#39;s management, which instructs the Minister of Finance how to vote at CEZ&#39;s General Meeting.
If you become the Prime Minister, will you change the personnel conditions on the Supervisory Board and change the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, I&#39;ll see you if I&#39;m prime minister.
I&#39;m not him yet.
It is rumored that ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with the CSSD for even better ones with YES.
For example, after the election, everything will go on again.
I know nothing about it.
I don&#39;t have any Pokorný or Růžička lobbyist, I&#39;m an independent unit and I don&#39;t solve this at all.
So answer directly.
If you become the head of government, will you strive to change the leadership of ČEZ, Czech Television or Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna, ie the institutions you are criticizing?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he has been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look up Mr Schwarzenberg&#39;s statements.
Although the state has a majority in ČEZ, it never managed it, it was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
It&#39;s a trivial matter for me.
CEZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate it, push it into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supplier competition or find a co-investor and build a new nuclear unit.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear units is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her programs are running a permanent targeted campaign against me, but I do not have and will not have any competence to fire someone.
But master yes.
I don&#39;t want to control anyone.
I&#39;m just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don&#39;t really know how these institutions are doing.
How come they don&#39;t know?
After all, the Chamber of Deputies approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the general directors of ČT and ČRo.
Look at how the reports are discussed, on the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigative files and to the Babiš lex.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push him to fire me from the government, which added a percentage of TOP 09, but the CSSD took them away.
They fear the disruption of their corrupt system, and so they talk about the threat to democracy by Babish.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-chairman of ANO, Jaroslav Faltýnek, builds his power base by appointing his son to the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with related lawyers Květoslav Hlín with city and state companies such as Prague Transport Company and Czech Railways?
We have a constant dispute over this.
I don&#39;t like it and I&#39;ve blamed him several times.
Faltýnek argues that the mentioned lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn&#39;t do that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
Unlike the Socans, we have never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, Kratochvílová, Březina.
If there was any sign of clientelism in our country, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like that happens, we&#39;ll get rid of anyone, no matter who it is.
