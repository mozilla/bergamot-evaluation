Petr Cech: Last minute transfer?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day that you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
The next chance will come in winter.
Petr Cech, chelsea's current substitute goalkeeper, is not currently sitting on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the Smíchov NH Hotel, talks to Czech journalists and prepares with the Czech national team for a game dress rehearsal with the Americans and subsequently for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualifier against the Netherlands.
Thibaut Courtois is preferred to Chelsea in the new Premier League season, while Cech has been appointed as a substitute for the first time in ten years at the London club.
Some time ago, there was speculation that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup to Atlético at the start of the season and failed to even make the start of the league season, losing 2–4 in San Sebastian.
There has also been speculation about Paris SG's interest.
He was reschedued for the French league season with two wins and two draws, and on Sunday he thousted St. Etienne 5-0.
Relatively the most pushy shoe club AS Monaco.
He has a 1-1-2 record in the league so far and broke up with Lille 1-1 at the weekend.
There were reports on english tabloid websites today that the Czech might want to play for Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Cech's last-minute departure from Chelsea is not very likely.
Skybet put a 4-to-1 odds on him.
Peter, is it possible you'll change your jersey in the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but in football, nothing is ever 100 percent.
Maybe during the day there'll be an offer that can't be refused.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(laughs) "Well, I don't know yet what an offer that can't be refused actually looks like.
It would have to be agreed by all sides First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's position whether or not the club would deal with a possible offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in your new location?
I haven't thought about that.
But there are a lot of players in that situation today, they're all at representative conventions somewhere, and I'm sure there's going to be a lot of transfers today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs on the planet could afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing to leave?
The situation where I did not catch in the first three games of the new season is new to me after 15 years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue to be a part of this battle for the Chelsea goalkeeper position and it is up to the coach who he chooses, what decisions he makes over the next few weeks.
What role does family play in your decision-making?
I take into account all the factors.
Of course, the sporting aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from a personal point of view, to which the needs of the family obviously belong.
Is it possible you could play for another club in England?
That's a question I thought would never concern me.
But anything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.

Police in Karrata arrest 20-year-old after motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it was speeding 125 km/h through the 70 km/h zone and went into the bush to escape the police.
In Karrata this morning, traffic police tried to stop a blue motorcycle on the side of the road when they noticed it was going 125km/h at the exit of a service station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then turned into bush, leaving the officers out of sight.
The motorcycle and a person matching the driver's description were then spotted at a house in Walcott Way, Bulgara.
Karrath police charged the 20-year-old with disobeying a stop call and careless driving.
He will appear in court in Karrata on September 23.
The motorcycle was impounded for three months.
George Webster accused of rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
A man will stand trial on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was made aware of the allegations during a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
Webster allegedly assaulted her while she was "not conscious, asleep, and in no condition to give her consent."
Webster is also being prosecuted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Highlands, on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set a trial date for 17 November at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Restoring the very American ideal that labor rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill to protect union organizing as a civil right.
"The way the unions work, jobs work for the middle class," says Ellison, a Democratic senator from Minnesota who is co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud to introduce, together with john lewis' model of intermittent rights, a law empowering employees.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in trade union organizing as other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-union forces
Adjusting the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees facing discrimination if they want to join a union to sue in civil court - and to sue for compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents are proposing in the bill is to reconnect with the American ideal.
Despite the union fights that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace, expand, and respect labor rights.
There was a time, and millions of Americans still remember it, when the country in the same breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that hideki toya's military autocracies were replaced by democracy.
Convinced that employees and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, they included language in them and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, collectively negotiate, and act is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to create a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Aware that employees would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, the Germans included a clause that openly states: "The right to form associations that secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Arrangements restricting or seeking to damage this right will be revoked. Measures to fulfil such a purpose are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the plaintiffs and Roosevelt included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form and enter into trade unions in order to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premisus that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to form labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote themselves in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the strength of the nation, but expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry, and raised production to unsued levels.
Those who challenge unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and we should not.
Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and extending civil rights protections to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are restoring the ideals that lifted America up and made it a true promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily blocks law that could close all louisiana abortion clinics
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that advocates say would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
The ordinance, enacing Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal's signature in June, due to take effect on September 1, would require abortion doctors to have the right to receive a patient at a hospital within 30 miles of performing their practice.
The judge's order means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and must obtain such permission in the meantime.
"The proposing party will be able to legally operate and obtain a permit in the meantime," the order from federal Judge John deGravelles states.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month so that the judge can issue a more permanent order regarding the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, the latest in a series of similar measures, and said it would give doctors more time to obtain a permit.
"Today's decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from a tricky law that is intended to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued three of the five clinics to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applies to doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs, and they are also seeking permission.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declareing such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have closed most of the state's remaining clinics were blocked by a federal judge Friday.
Women's abortion rights campaigners, along with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have such a permit places medically non-medical requirements on doctors.
Opponents of abortion argue that the measures are aimed at protecting women's health, and some also welcomed the fact that the measures would close clinics.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said that in Louisiana, only one abortion doctor has a permit.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, the doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of his safety, the group said.
In response, Louisiana authorities said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while they wait for a rights application to be processed.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, rural ovarian cancer kills more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video paying tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analysed the medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
Researchers followed the women over seven years of treatment.
Dr Jordan said the chances of survival affected women's age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socioeconomic status.
The lowest survival rates were in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that factors can be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"Gynecooncologists, who usually reside in larger cities, are best able to treat the disease," she said.
Despite improvements in remote medical services to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor suggested that strengthening the transportation service, which will allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated far from their family and friends, would help.
Dr Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geography, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, young gold coast mom Elisha Neave was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with an extraordinary decline in homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to garden centres losing up to £10 million a year when today's younger generation of consumers reaches the "primary gardening age group."
According to the report, people who rent housing spend an average of 55% of the amount spent on their gardens.
Other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated £5 billion a year, cite an increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of front gardens used as parking space and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the proportion of homes owned has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, one household has the lowest expenditure on horticultural products in Britain.
The HTA and the Royal Horticulturous Society said that sub-renting or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief horticulturist for the RHS, said: "It is very popular for tenants to grow plants in pots - when they move, they can take the plants with them."
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher proportion of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales this year due to better weather, which came after unfavorable conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After putin, at a meeting of his youth organization, which most of all reminds me of Hitlerjugend, he snorted with atomic weapons and basically let everyone know that he did not care about their views, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia exhibits many features of a fascist state.
Great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both tense nationalism and that they can transform the inferiority complex into imperialist appetites.
Time seems to be different in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars for supremacy over Europe was long gone , in the East, on the contrary, it thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and that we need to regain their international position.
Such sentiment and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis took power, followed by an outburst of nationalism not unlike today's situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the bashing of journalists, the elimination of uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, is quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of Russians, may miss a time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled before them.
Western politicians may have been self-made, maybe they didn't pat Vladimir on the shoulders enough, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted to go, and maybe they started underestimating him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He got his house in order, pretended he didn't really want to go anywhere, and sharpened knives at home.
Now he's decided to take back lost positions.
He'll start slowly, he's got time.
He's probably a life-old leader, so where would he go?
He trampled the Caucasians, now he tramples the Ukrainians, then it's the turn of the midgets of the Baltics.
They've been pinching a Russian bear in a fur coat long enough.
China, which is jumping up and down and is certainly looking for the Far East, will also notice.
And the Germans are really off vladimir, too, how well they're doing, and we put that on their asses when they were 45.
How about making one new Novorosija in Karlovy Vary.
That would be a base, and there are plenty of ours, and as they oppress them there, they've already tried to tear down some of them.
After all, our veterans still remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, that prime minister of theirs, Gospodin Sobotka, he's so soft, you can peel like an onion and eat their whole EU.
That's how they'd play to make a big Russia jump on.
They need to be reminded where their place is.
And we're going to use our friends who live on their territory as detonators.
There are plenty of Russians everywhere, and when they say they're being oppressed there, they're just oppressed there, and we're not going to let that happen, we're going to protect them.
And once again, The Russian will rule , for what else is he born to do?
After all, Europe is good as a preposition on which the proud Ivan can dance a Cossack.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report
Turkey's foreign minister has called in the country's highest-ranking U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British espionage activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said U.S. charge d'affaires and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services, according to documents provided by a former analyst for the US National Security Agency.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all major states were watching each other.
An earlier report that German intelligence had also targeted Ankara provoked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones introduces more season four tricks
Game of Thrones creators are currently filming episodes of the fifth season of the cult series.
At the same time, they were touted by how the tricks of season four were created.
The most visible are computer adaptations of the serial environment and mass scenes, when a group of soldiers becomes a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
On Friday, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and city hall officials in the Calvia autonomous region to the Mallorcan prosecutor's office.
The head of police in Calvia, on the holiday island of Majorca, has been arrested following allegations made by businessmen and bar owners in magaluf's infamous party district.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located, brought corruption charges against him.
According to the Mallorca Diario online daily, on Friday, the complainants presented evidence of extortion by police officers and city officials in the Calvia autonomous region to the Prosecutor's Office for The Fight against Corruption.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish state police on corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spain's national newspaper, ABC, quoted disgruntled nightclub owners as saying that favoritism by public officials has serious implications for their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about surviving," one of the businessmen said in court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a video surfaced on YouTube of an 18-year-old British tourist giving oral sex to 24 men while touring bars.
Island authorities have since tried to keep an eye on drunks and rioters at holiday parties in Magaful by reducing the number of infamous alcohol bar tours.
In addition, the Playhouse club where the oral sex incident took place was forced to close for a year and pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000) along with carnage bar tour organizers.
The Tourist Resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular with Britons, has also witnessed many alcohol-related accidents, including a fashionable wave known as "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
First day of spring marked by rain and thunderstorms affecting flight at Adelaide Airport
SPRING brought an icy surprise to the south of South Australia, with heavy rain and strong winds severely hitting Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of precipitation is expected in the city until 9 p.m., and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The latest rain was introduced along with a few brief showers associated with the storm and wind gusts that began just before 8 p.m. and brought nearly 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After a few early doses of spring came after winter last week, temperatures in the city dropped again on Monday to just 15.8°C.
Stormy weather is thought to have contributed to Virgin Airlines' delayed arrival from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was due to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to postpone landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport at the time were around 50km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the plane must have left the second landing and eventually landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delays caused delays on other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Qantas flight from Sydney.
Temperatures are forecast to reach a maximum of 16C in Adelaide on Tuesday and there may be one or two showers.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas. But schools in Gaza remain closed as the territory recovers from the fighting.
The beginning of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in southern Israel marked by the attacks, but signs of struggle are still evident.
In Asdod, a town in the south of the country, staff at a kindergarten hit by a rocket removed shrapnel remains from the wall and are slowly awaiting the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a kibbutz Saad resident and English teacher at a local school.
A lot of kids in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, revealed that "it's a little strange" to go back to school all at once.
"We've had some tough times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibbutz, which is close to the Gaza border, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the population.
Until last week's cease-fire ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and headed to safer areas away from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian mortar shell killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The Education Minister said about a dozen families had still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the gaza border that has been hit hard by Palestinian fire.
He urged children to study hard, adding, "We will provide you with education and safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on an indefinite peace.
While the cease-fire led to an immediate cessation of hostilities, it did not address key issues such as Hamas's demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen Gaza's airports and ports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
Palestinians and the UN estimate that more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of them civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although it has no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians died, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortar rounds at Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli military, for its own work, has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in 100 UN schools that have been transformed into makeshift shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in shelters and the ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can finish our education just like the Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza's largest city.
Willow at the meeting: I stand by Vácha.
And Lafata's worried about the temperature.
The Czech national football team met in Prague before noon today before Wednesday's preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship qualifier against the Netherlands.
Spartan striker David Lafata, who is suffering from the temperature, is in trouble from the 23-man squad.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players, and David's probably still a little bit in trouble.
But we want him to be here and be fine as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it's two or three days or he'll be fit tomorrow, we'll see about his medical condition, which will be decided by our doctor," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some pain, but it is not that they cannot train or participate in a match on Wednesday with the USA," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday evening, Vrba was called up as the last player by Spartan midfielder Lukáš Vácha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also considered.
I decided on the basis that Lukáš is a promising player who is 25 years old.
It was very difficult to make decisions, but I stand by it," Vrba said to Vácha.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latatta.
It is possible that in case of health problems, the nomination could still change.
At the weekend, for example, The Liberec Josef Šural, who scored a hat-trick, flashed a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have been showing form lately.
Let's see how David Lafata is doing.
If he is not available on Wednesday, I am not saying that I cannot nominate one of the players who have impressed in the Czech league," said Vrba.
This afternoon the national team will have training at Strahov, and on Tuesday the classic pre-match training before the duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph session.
The match against the Americans will be played on Wednesday from 8:15 p.m. and the national team will be aiming for a premiership victory under Willow.
He has won two draws in the previous three preliminaries and lost once.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9 at 8:45 p.m.
Pesice goes to Italy on the Dutch
Willow is glad that, unlike previous reunions, he has more time to train.
It's an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can rehearse certain things with them that we may not have had as much time for before.
Now we will only be able to focus on getting the best prepared for the Netherlands," Vrba said.
The Dutch will be presented in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by former interim national team coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us information that's from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have the game on film and we're going to discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there are," Vrba said of the bronze medalists from the recent world championships.
According to closely watched statistics, apartment prices increased in the winter period by the most in the last seven years.
According to the RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Housing Value Index, home prices rose 1.1 per cent in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase of 4.2% for June, July and August, the highest increase for the winter months since 2007.
Annual price increases climbed to 10.9%, more than double in the year to August 2013, but profits were not evenly distributed in the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne were leading the market.
RP Data shows Sydney house prices rose by 16.1 per cent last year, while Melbourne prices rose by 11.7 per cent.
The other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price increases averaging between five and six per cent.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was hurt by a state-mandated spending cut and where prices rose by only 1.4 per year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the continued high auction sell-off rate, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will increase further over the next three months," he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never told me, "I love you."
Henry was born in 1958, one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
He and his father, who died when Henry was 19 and who worked in a factory, had a colder relationship.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melody is optimistic.
Henry, however, had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry underwent "thorough" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You've never seen his face, you've just heard his voice say, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - they were adults when I was a kid - went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of punching in cricket.
I've never talked to him like that.
For most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading the paper.
Henry had recently visited a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father's time, he gave an glimpse of what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light nowadays, but it's still a dark, smoky, gloomy labyrinth where flames erupt and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got in the tub and just lay there, then you could hear him slowly starting to sing for himself because he was washing the foundry off him.
As I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to support his family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, say "I love you."
It wasn't until mom was sick and dying that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop with "I love you"?
Don't give me a look at me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
He and French, with whom he was married for 25 years, are still good friends.
Dawn's good.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and I was starting to show symptoms of diabetes, the doctor said to me, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to a big fitness center, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
Nobody wants to eat carrots.
The change in direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After getting critical acclaim for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theater.
This was followed by a comedy full of mistakes and August Wilson's Fences.
It's a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ spotted him on stage parodying someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent show.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time, I was the only black actor/comedian on TELEVISION."
He learned as he went.
In addition to being noticed by the public, I also had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to make working jokes, be a star and be on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed in it for five years.
My family was already in a state of resentful.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and awkward position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
But what was "for years and years an edthing major product of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decades took him adverts, documentaries, TV series and roles in films, but after his LennyHenry.tv series aired on the BBC in 2008, he thought, "So what are you going to do now, Len, it kind of looks like you're stuck in one place or a little out of the way."
Next up was a Radio 4 documentary called What's So Great About...? What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't learn it properly at school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should give it a try."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry delivered 20 lines from Othello's closing argument for the document, and he was already in on it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it's given me courage.
"That's what it's all about. It's a serious matter, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So rehearsals were hard, and I've been reading the play for months and months.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which they didn't.
He soon began staring in a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre. I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for confiscating the audience.
"A voice in my head said to me, 'Before they fix the computer, you have to entertain them for ten minutes.'"
Instead, the theater director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Um, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can handle this for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the game."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of fences was a challenge.
Panic is quite good, adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it's like a sign from God that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a resounding voice.
So I'm just staying with it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
Henry still has the comedian's brain - he interrupts our conversation all the time with humorous performances as he enters and performs from the role of an immimeasor.
I decided not to do stand-up because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I guess.
If you're always looking for something, you can get to a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I don't like it like I used to.
I asked if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps to give the outlines of the beginning, middle and end of the journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give it up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine a light on non-existent employees
Kenya has started biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the government's payroll.
According to a government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will stop receiving pay.
The government believes that thousands of people are still being paid after they have left the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to prevent corruption in the civil service.
An audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least $1 million (£700,000) a month in the payouts of non-existent employees and further abuse of official authority.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts even after an employee has died or after an employee leaves the civil service, said a BBC reporter from nairobi's capital, Wanyama Chebusiri.
All civil servants must appear at identification centres within the next two weeks where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government statement said.
He goes on to say that anyone who does not show up without sufficient apologies will be removed from the payroll.
"By identifying actual public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economic development and will also be used to clean up payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees," said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested over 'plot' against government
Local media report that a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of a "plot against the government."
The police department has not yet commented on the case.
Fourteen high-ranking officials were among those detained, according to Hurriyet Dail News.
Some of them were involved in a Corruption Investigation in December that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and phone tapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the work of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children have returned to school in Ukraine
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after summer holidays.
This day has traditionally been important for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsene Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the journalists present that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for generations to come:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1.
Not all of Ukraine is peaceful.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for hard times
It carries with it clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal co-duct of the Conservative Party.
She herself has experience on the front lines.
She began her career at bain and co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the pearsons media world.
She was executive director of the Financial Times for seven years. She resigned when her younger colleague took over as head of Pearson's parent company.
They say her severance package was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended to Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet Office.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the director's work as a chalice with poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an inner paradox in its structure.
The corporation is turning in two directions: inwards to the top layer of the BBC's own leadership hierarchy, but also to the public voice in times of unrest when things don't work out.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for thorough reform.
But which ceo would risk coming to a company as complex as a Chinese dynasty, dismeding it and the way it would take its job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - its power, its finances - and how its status is being revised.
As competition expands and new technology challenges old certainties, the immediate negotiation of licence fees for the BBC carries great danger.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying a stake in what is surely the largest media business in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, costing only 40p a day each.
Moreover, the BBC's popularity is clearly rising: to 53% of supporters, up from 31% a decade ago.
Models of using BBC services have changed: Today, I get headlines on my mobile phone, and I can watch shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a much loved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry says he didn't approve of the offensive tweet
A tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry's official Twitter account, which was posted Sunday, contained an offensive image of the Democratic attorney general initiating criminal charges against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another was posted on Perry's account, distancing himself from the previous one.
A tweet left my account that wasn't authorized.
"I don't agree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in another post.
Perry's aides did not immediately respond to messages asking questions.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it's unclear who is actually responsible for managing it.
A previous tweet posted an unflattering, humorous picture of Travis County State's Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay funds to her office, which brought Perry, a possible presidential candidate in the 2016 election, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
The caption in the tweet read: "I don't always drive with three times the legal blood alcohol limit... But if I do, I'm going to sue Governor Perry for calling me to account."
I'm the most intoyed Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office wasn't in the lead in the investigation against Perry.
He was in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found not guilty and called the charges a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team asked the judge overseeing the case to dismiss the charges because the use of the law to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry suspended the payment of $7.5 million from the State Public Interest Defense Fund, which is based in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection prompted a formal complaint from a left-leaning group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it's famous.
After finishing fifth on his party's committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might be done, tweeting a photo of him running near a lake and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to "normal"
One of London's most prestigious developers has warned that the housing market in south-east England has "returned" to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital has been the subject of high demand and rising prices, and widespread fears of a credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to introduce limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of berkeley's challenging client development company, said On Monday, "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from its peak in 2013 to normal transaction levels." It adds that this provides a "stable environment for functioning."
London's housing market did well during the downturn as foreign buyers flooded into the capital.
According to Land Registry data, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% last year alone, far outstepped the average of 6.7% in England and across Wales.
Average sales prices for private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year, climbing to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening pound has made them less attractive to foreign buyers of London property in recent months - some of whom have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "settlement tax" that politicians have come up with ahead of next May's general election.
London-day real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter lending rules, would also slow the market's growth rate for both real estate and prices during the second half of the year.
New Bank of England data on Monday showed a decline in the number of mortgages approved for July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has lowered its forecast for London house price growth to 3% for 2015, on the basis that house prices have already started to fall.
Meanwhile, transaction volumes have fallen by a quarter each year in London's most expensive boroughs such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to wa ellis.
Yet demand for housing in the capital was a boon for Berkeley as it raised cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same and as a result forward sales have remained."
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose 40% to £380m, revenues up 18% to £1.6bn.
On Monday, ahead of pidgley's annual meeting, he said berkeley's annual earnings were expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that annual pre-tax profit will be £450 million.
Berkeley shares halted at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
Hacker posted nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence online
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online because of a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of photos of hundreds of aspiring actresses.
A spokesman for the "Hunger Games" star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for "an apparent violation of privacy."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker allegedly obtained the photos, which were originally posted on the image-sharing site 4chan, thanks to a hole in Apple's iCloud internet storage system. BuzzFeed's alleged list of hacked victims includes the names of dozens of stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It's unclear how many photos are authentic, but "Scott Pilgrim vs. the Rest of the World" star Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope those of you who view photos my husband and I took years ago in the privacy of our home are happy with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, known for the cable TV series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied that the photos were genuine. She tweeted, "These alleged nude photos of me are fake, people."
It's better to cut it off in the tinge. *deliberate pun*.
Buzzfeed reported Sunday night that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the alleged photos were genuine.
An extraordinary excerpt from Howard Jacobson's much-tchauched new novel about love and the letter "J"
They melted, that's the best way to describe it, gradually decomposing like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too complex, too violent, isolated, and maybe a little immobile.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it induitfully.
He could like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this ability was an insuitful love affair, which more than usual promised to relieve him of the lonely boredom of life and perhaps even give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a frail beauty with a wild mane of hair and a fickle heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited her possessions in a damp but beautiful valley called, conveniently, paradise valley.
No one's lived in the house in years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the baths, the slugs had signed their windows as if they thought they owned the place, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage made of children's stories, terrifying and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat on folding chairs in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning in to a public station that supplied the region with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black comedian who his father liked to listen to with the blinds drawn.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they didn't play such songs on the radio anymore.
They were not forbidden - nothing was really banned - they just weren't played.
They helped them get into the desuetuda, as did the word desuetudo itself.
Folk tastes have done what regulations and outlaws could never do, and just as people choose memoirs when it comes to books, in which the poor man becomes rich, cookbooks and love novels, so ballads are chosen in music.
Kavern let himself be pulled down by the day and began playing the imaginary piano, serenading Aillina's big feet in a coarse, comical voice.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically sticking two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him he played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth for a j-word, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't very funny then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Ailinn's never heard one.
Even jazz, even if it wasn't outlawed, didn't play.
Improvisation went out of fashion.
There was only room for one if in life.
When the melody started playing, people wanted to know exactly where it was going to end up.
Same with humor.
His unforeseenness got on people's nerves.
And jazz was the humor expressed in song.
Although he hadn't heard from Sammy Davis Jr. until he was 10 years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least Aillin didn't have to say fats waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when favorite singers weren't black.
Also without laws or coercion.
A permitted society is one in which every part of it, with gratitude - with the gratitude of those who have been happy to be spared - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent with temperament and constitution were suited to fun and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent, as if naturally endeaused for electronics, took responsibility for no family being without a working phone.
The Poles who stayed were plumbers, Greeks who stayed, washing dishes.
Those from the Gulf and Levant states, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly while what happened if it happened - they were afraid of being accused of planting in the fire, in fact they were afraid that the fire would be spent next time - they opened restaurants selling labneh and smoking hooks, not alerting themselves, and inaction slowly eating them up.
Everyone by their talent.
Having only listened to ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how the dirty words Kavern had just sung to her could turn into music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people who have too big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape from behind the soundprotew sheets.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She thought he was weird.
"He thought she was funny," he said finally.
She shook her head in disbelief and shaded Kevern's view.
All the wide world could see nothing but a medd of her raven hair.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked again.
Not exactly feet.
Maybe a little ankle...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" to her, but it was too soon.
"I'm attracted to your fat ankles right now," he said.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him into trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to tame the cruelty lurking in jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe Kavern was deliberately cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons went red and rose from the sun lounger, dropped the radio, and spilled the wine.
Elder wine, so it wasn't the drink's turn.
She seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a storm in her excitement.
"I'm perversely attracted to you for being a jerk," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unassuy words and for the fear in her eyes the moment she confronted him.
Did she think he was going to kill her?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was the same in the basics as here.
The same wide and icy ocean was splrowing against them.
The same deranged men, after WHAT had happened, even more petut and grumpy than their ancestors, smugglers and spoilers, wandered angrily from pub to pub, ready to raise their hands to any woman who dared to reject them or laugh at them.
idiot?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to cuddle her - cuddling became the most common term for erotic teasing between a man and a woman: an antidote to the faint ballads of love that the radio spewed - first they anointed her, then punched her in the face.
In Kevern's view, too much sophistication, because cuddling was an act of violence in itself.
Ailinn Solomons told him not to leave.
He rose from the deckchair like an old man.
She felt annoyed herself, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave - as if watching him from an upstairs window - a man caught up with what he had done.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was closed for him and for all men in general, notwithstanding the fact that a few had beaten her.
The man turned away from her, shoulders down, ashamed, defeated, all his militancy had left him- why did she feel that he knew this sight well, even though she could not remember a moment until today, that she would ever see it again?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working at Ofnow, the non-constant monitoring system of Public Mood, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where it was mitigated or stopped, most expected if enough money and energy were spent to eliminate it.
"A lot has been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to soothe the innate aggression of people who fought many battles and won most of them, especially in the smounted, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the tops of church towers rising above hedges, a touch of human kindness has historically rarely appeared."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents sigh at sentimental ballads, devour unhappy stories and claim to firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only do old brutality in rugged areas hold up as stubbornly as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that new and offensive intolerance is emerging at home, in the workplace, on the roads, and even on sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too flowery," said her superior.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I need to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again objected to her right to privacy and silence.
feminist?
Another silence.
"That's not why I'm asking," Rabinowitz said finally, "that I have something against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
We're not prejudiced in this workplace.
We serve an unbiased society.
But a kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you have demonstrated.
Clearly, you yourself are biased against the church - things you call "cruel" and "brutal" could also be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and energy.
Keep trying to figure out what happened if it happened, like it would happen, if it happened yesterday, preparing a country with its basic life force.
As Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind him, a recommendation flashed pink on the light board that Ofnow had been broadcasting to the world for the past quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, have conversations, explain, make a deal, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, a sung word is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I completely understand your reservations," Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, when she was sure her supervisor was finished, "and I'm not saying the wound didn't heal the way we tell it to heal.
My concern, first of all, is that if we are not brought to our attention in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened if it happened.
But this time, we're not going to vent our anger and mistrust at others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips.
That was supposed to be endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe the steps that your grandparents may or may not have taken as mistakes.
You go too far in talking about venting your "anger" and "distrust" at "others."
I shouldn't remind anyone in your position that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we're not talking about "us" and "them."
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"During which, if we're honest with each other," Esme plucked up the courage, "no one is blameless.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to blame on someone, there are no things that should be remedied, even if the remedy is appropriate and possible.
But what's the point of the past but to learn from it-
The past exists to forget.
If there's anything I can add-
Luther Rabinowitz unplugged his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said, dismissing it.
The next day, as she was going to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who hit the pavement in what passersby described as "brutal and furious."
Coincidences happen.
Lesoth army says no coup planned - Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers in lesoth have denied plotting to overthrow the government and say they acted against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country and says the army has surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
After saying he had been threatened with death, the Prime Minister and his family went to neighbouring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not really a coup, but the army's response to the threat of "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"This morning, the Defense Forces Command of the Kingdom of Lesotha acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there were several groups in the ranks of the police that were planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to wreak havoc in the country," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military actions appeared to be an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has declared that he seized government power by force, lesoth's defense forces appear to be carrying signs of a coup d'etat," he said.
Military officials in lesoth said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
In Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he thought he was under attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended parliament due to internal disputes.
He said that despite the contrary claims, his actions did not undermine the government.
Euro area production at 13-month low
Manufacturing growth slowed to a 13-month low in August, according to a closely watched survey in the eurozone.
The final euro area purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August from 51.8 in June.
A figure greater than 50 is an expansion.
New orders have declined and factories have been damaged by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the eurozone's delayed recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he was considering quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to that of the UK and US during the financial crisis.
"While at least some growth is better than no growth, the drag on manufacturers from the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty is becoming increasingly visible," said Rob Dobson, Markit's chief economist.
Germany's manufacturing PMI, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driver of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands have disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The industry slowdown is likely to add fuel to analysts' expectations of implementing additional monetary or tax stimulus.
One positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the purchasing managers' manufacturing report for August is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: Euro area producers currently have a very difficult life, as rising geopolitical tensions - particularly between Russia and Ukraine - add even more uncertainty to the increasingly challenging conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty has demonstrably affected trade - particularly consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially costly ones.
He said it was "even more likely" that the ECB would eventually have to make some form of quantitative easing, "although we expect it to be limited."
Ten years of hell for Beslan survivors: Ten years since the horrors of the occupied school, children are still suffering
Ten years ago, 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the ordeal, which lasted three days and shocked the world
We returned to Beslan to search for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity.
Exactly ten years after the horrific capture of a school in Beslan that killed 334 people, including 186 children, survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to tragedy united east and west, leading to action and future in this catastrophic disaster.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who resisted misfortune, even if the memory of the hell caused by the terrorists will live on in them.
What's their biggest wish?
So that the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is over.
Girl trying to climb back into ruined school gymnasium
She was captured by leading Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov trying to climb back into a bombed-out school gymnasium in her underwear after a bomb exploded in her underwear.
Confused, Aida was desperately searching for her mother Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but in fact they survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to find my mother.
She was rescued by a soldier.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pains came back.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another surgery.
I've got bits of shrapnel left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said firmly.
"It just happened to me, and it can't be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate from Jera Gapoeva's class was killed there.
When we were kids, we used to play together and imagine going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I'll think about my family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten her captivity, but her memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my picture of myself climbing through the school window on the Internet, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the 7-year-old said, "My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand."
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She told him, "Run."
Fearing she was dead, he ran and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed the child's hand and ran away with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, "Damir told me his mother was dead."
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara staggered to freedom and lay in the hospital with a leg injury, thinking her son had died.
After they met again, she said, "I cried with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the defunct News of the World newspaper), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell the memories are fading.
I remember right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But today I can play computer games where you shoot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember kids I played with in the yard who didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted at the toy store and how I drove a convertible.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where he suffers as much as he and his friends suffered because of the war.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I feel so sorry for anyone who has to go through this horror," says Damir, who volunteered at the monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to work in the police force someday, and I'm hoping to be accepted into the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, says: "They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack. There were no children screaming and running around, and the silence lasted for months.
He vividly remembers traveling with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it's been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and helping me and Damir.
I remember Damir's appetite for borscht, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water pistol, and they ran and played with him.
And that was only a month away from the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how supportive they were.
She said, "I still think the world hasn't changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been and will be killed.
They're just like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they're bored or doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what a horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir grew up and he's a nice, quiet kid, he's not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care about that at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he's very close to six classmates, and he goes to the gym from time to time and light candles.
When he was smaller, he had problems with it - I remember sometimes lying on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying there for hours.
He wasn't sleepy, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his pistols or other toy guns. Damiro is 17 today, taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for several hours I was sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was pretty sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
"I remember shouting 'Damir, run, run!', but I was convinced he couldn't hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives go on, unlike others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
Boy whose photo taken after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Consolation: Beslan survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, grigory on the right today
As he ran for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was engraved in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the atrocity in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day and rushed to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed the yard, so my little boy was alone for three days," she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it's getting harder to think about and talk about.
Not a day goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn't feel like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments keep coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Ever-returning memories: The photo of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalised as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of a crying Grigory in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at that picture, and we keep it in the librarian's at home.
I get it, but I also think that the picture makes people all over the world know how much pain we're feeling.
Today, Grigory says, "The important thing is that this doesn't happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Tragedies like this are still under investigation, but the truth will never be told.
They're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what the cause was?
This world is about to do something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants war, so how is that possible?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
To forget a little, it takes decades.
It's had an effect on my health, I can still feel it.
I had nightmares about the attack for three or four years, but then it got better.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was terrified every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why when September 1st approaches, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to enter that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikaz.
I want to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
First I wanted to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but for my health, I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being held at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miracle: Gregori Farniyev was held at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
"It feels like it was yesterday," said Gregorij, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent but was unable to because of the injuries he sustained during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've put behind me.
I'm older now and they say children can deal with bad experiences better - I have to say that's not true.
"I went to see a psychologist in 2006 and it made me feel a little better, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - that was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'm never going there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregori Farniev today, on a laptop with a photo of him taken in hospital after the attack
The pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt, but I'm walking normally now.
But even so, due to my health, I was unable to get on and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they told me it wasn't possible.
My next hobby is animals, so I got on the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from "cats to cows".
He said, "I know I'll never tell my children about it.
It's not something that kids should know about, let's not something they should experience.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "The pain will always be there.
He's inside, getting worse as the anniversary approaches.
I'll attend the commemoration ceremonies.
I know Grigory won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there, unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God for returning it to me. There are footprints everywhere here in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregori is an adult today, but he carries on the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say he's 50% over the scare, but you can't get over it completely and forget it.
This horrible experience with us will always be.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people that I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me to lose those killed.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who never remar dmared.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost popped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
We've been a friendly country in the past, so how did we get to fight now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could pick up all these rebels and throw them away as far away as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child who was carried to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyona Tskaevu is carried to a secure Russian special commando (left).
Now she is ten (right) and has no recolcess of tragedy
In 2004, the world gasped when a Russian policeman carried little Alyona out of Beslan's captivity in his arms.
The terrorists released her, but they kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar in captivity at the school gymnasium.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a little girl named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say Alyona, who is now 10, has no recollement of the attack and has grown into a bright and happy little girl.
A close friend said that "they are a great happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids."
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.

4 tips for taking better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking photos or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment available.
The cheapest option is a compact such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor camera of type GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which costs about $300.
I took these pictures at a family party with a couple of cameras, all costing less than $350.
It doesn't matter what equipment you use, there are several rules for the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, set up your camera based on what type of photos or videos you're going to take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to dark underwater environments.
And before you do that, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are only 5 feet long, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both regular and waterproof designs.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them won't come out.
Compact cameras have LCD to help you compose photos, but outdoors don't have one.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be hard to see underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpretentious.
So always take more pictures.
If your camera has a bracketing mode that takes a series of images with slightly different exposure variance, take advantage of it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dive of light, it declines significantly.
If possible, stay close to the surface when taking photos in the pool, lake or sea.
It also allows you to capture more light in photos - the deeper you dive, the fewer colors you will see.
Get close to the object being photographed.
That's great advice if you're taking pictures on land, but underwater it's even more important because of the dimmed light.
This is especially important if you're shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill a photo frame, you need to get closer to objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could change things even in an organisation as huge as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the effects of the torture that crippled him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnoses and illnesses, treated patients are overwhelmingly interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I don't feel like myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He struggled with flu symptoms and found that he was impatient and that his wife Juliet was remorseful.
He remarked, "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague X-rayed his chest.
One or two weeks before that, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleurisy or lining of the lungs.
In most cancers, it's hard to tell what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But mesotelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos - a building fibly material that was previously described as "miraculous", but is now known to be deadly dangerous.
It wasn't hard for most of us to ignore mesothlioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even when asbestos was in use, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulation treasurers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers.
The toxin used in industry in another era now hardly seems like a cause for concern.
But such complacency is not appropriate.
As it turns out, a mesotelioma epidemic is now peaking in Britain.
The number of deaths from mesotelioma here is higher than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths from this disease per year are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelimus per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are only now sensing its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The mesothelimus disaster is not confined to veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops in which we shop.
Thus, mesotelioma does not respect the social class, wealth, occupation or age.
Privileged bastions from London department stores to public schools are no hiding place.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are the repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even think of isolation.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years practicing," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and doormans - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been to Guy's Hospital and who have developed mesotelioma in the past five years," he noted in a 2010 letter, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesotelioma when he was 48.
He was 55 when he died on February 17 this year.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesotelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
Now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to leading British mesothelioma expert Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is taking place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A cursory look at the files from the court archives, to which the disabled often turn and require compensation, shows how widespread the mesotelioma scourge has become.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Asbestos to Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw the clothing section in two stores - one of the locations being the company's flagship store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children in their 20s.
"Before it happened," she says, "I'd never heard of mesothelimus before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never dreamed he'd have anything to do with me.
There aren't many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
He got his name because of his fibrous structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Most often today, chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, can be found in buildings.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake linings.
Not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and who still consider it a "major health risk" that can cause death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (krokydolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that "there is compelling but circumstantial evidence that this was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelimus [in the UK]."
A Marsk & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider himself a typical victim of mesothelimus, but Julian Pete's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His patient study claims that "a substantial proportion of cases of mesothelimus without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment."
A significant part of this exposure is due to the "normal use and ventilation" of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
A goddard consulting report examining the Palace of Westminster shows that even those at the centre of government may not suspect that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report that found that service elevators and pipes behind parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be damaged by something as harmless as a "strong airflow."
Ministers are often accused of only caring about their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament's Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster be given a "positive medical certificate," it is now envisaged that it will take £1 million and several years of work to thoroughly inspect Parliament, upgrade electricity and remove asbestos, and that, after the 2015 election, MPs will sit in the premises of the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre rather than on the green benches at Westminster.
Goddard's report states that "the presence of asbestos is not in line with several regulations."
It is impossible to say whether this inconsistency will cost lives.
All anyone can do now is wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven," he says, "but in my case, I can't prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009 when he was overcome by something like chills.
He was 45, he was in the middle of surgery.
Suddenly I was shaking.
It came at once.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd drive home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the pleurisy, the lining around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesotelioma.
He ended up spending a month at home.
Confused doctors X-rayed his chest and introduced a chest catheter to remove fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
Yet they didn't make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time his symptoms returned, often after he had exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came into surgery with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesotelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray scans with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the space between the lining of his chest cavity and the lining of his lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was mesotelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesotelioma
Abbott started meeting with nurses from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"Asbestos has been shown to be widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to experience the disease.
So mesotelioma is now starting to apply to younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes were in the basement in hospitals, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, staff members who walked through basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often does) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, decades after the war, hospitals were a place where patients could be saved, but also a place that could have endangered the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed today.
Pupils built Bunsen's kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its excellent insulating and non-combustible properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos since school.
Somewhere in countless chemistry classes, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos pad.
A website has been created dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool sheds in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
"This is an industrial poison built into a large number of homes," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was a single contact with asbestos, which a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember, in the 1970s when the garden house was demolished.
So watch out for the way you're demolishing the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was the transition from doctor to patient position.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling confused by the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have left?"
I was told twelve months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to live to see another Christmas.
That's the way it is."
Mesotelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelimus are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is broken and fibers inhaled, they can settle in the pleurisy, lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleurisy and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which, paradoxically, is the leading center in the treatment of mesothelia.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during his time in the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, treasure says, and "breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
By its nature, it has been invasive from the very beginning.
For mesotelioma, common treatment options used in other types of cancer do not work as much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly debated.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the pleurisy," he says.
You don't get a scalpel around her.
The cancer "doesn't respond very much to chemotherapy", which has "some effect" but does not cure it.
"Sometimes there's someone who survives lung cancer," treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After discovering mesothelimus, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and advisor to equally disabled people.
When they called, he cheerfully introduced himself: "Hello, you've reached cancer control."
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning, the Abbotts offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and would probably only extend his life by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I was going to give up.
But Lawson "was able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the thorrier surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they checked me out," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a requisition and they'd have to approve a payment.
In order to get the best treatment available, the question of money is crucial for mesotelioma patients.
But when different treatments eventually inevitably fail, many patients face additional financial worries - the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're going to the courts and they want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health," morgan says.
In the 1960s, however, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan, it wasn't a "full settlement" because Lawson couldn't definitively prove that mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, following an investigation into the case, a Guy's Hospital spokesman confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminating basement was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
Seduging exposure to deadly asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces changed owners or went bankrupt.
The insurance register is missing.
And those who are now defending themselves against the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors certainly don't.
In response, important new legislation was passed this year, making it easier for mesotelioma patients to claim compensation even if their former employer cannot be traced.
The law created a $350 million financial reserve, which is covered by insurance companies and is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In that case, those affected will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally give them as compensation - around £120,000.
300 successfully processed applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like mesotelioma patients, thinks £350 million is a "good job."
"It's a deal written by insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time fell through and people with mesotelioma were able to track down former employers and sue them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Secretary of Labor and Social Affairs, acknowledged that the law "had loopholes."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that with seven deaths each year, swift action was needed.
"People are suffering too much, and they need help now," Penning said last December during the second reading of the mesothelimus law.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The operation was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski boasts a survival rate of five years in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott was strengthened.
"That's not the most important thing, of course," Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's something that drives you.
If you surrender, your condition can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The check-ups showed no signs of illness.
I went for another check-up in March [2014].
I had a few spots of [cancer] strewn across my chest.
My 50th birthday was just approaching.
It's not life-threatening.
He's into it.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
There are currently no traces of a tumor in his system.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or showing a woman how an alarm clock works on a cauldron.
When you hear bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
Like Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I'd never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very sociable and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face these conversations.
However, in patients with mesotelioma, such conversations are not lightened by hope or even a hint of a chance of survival.
The illness brings with it (and ultimately brought Stephen Jay Gould) bleak certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesotelioma does not threaten life."

Ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful injury claim due to exposure to asbestos in Britain.
World asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139 000 tonnes.

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - protesters vow revenge
Despite growing debates about democratic reform, China's parliament on Sunday decided not to allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began organizing and organizing just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We're not surprised, but we're furious," said legislator Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it's clear we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause "chaos."
Since 1997, when Britain restored Hong Kong's governance to China, Beijing has promised that from 2017 on, residents will be able to vote for executive power.
China's leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that China's leaders hold firm control of the nomination process for a committee that is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and Hong Kong" will be admissible.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of the largest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in years.
Behind most of hong kong's pro-democratic protests is the Occupation Center with Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district if Beijing does not grant them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupation in the Rain movement gathered outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would start waves of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently wanting to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, organizers said the movement "considered the occupation of the Headquarters only as a final step in case all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice left.
We regret to report that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the Headquarters is inevitable.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday they strengthened security at the government headquarters and deployed police officers and barricades.
Inciting unrest is, according to many Hong Kong residents, a sign that it is slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in products and services.
There are also growing fears that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement and say their demonstrations threaten trade - Hong Kong's lifeboat.
"The protest he's talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people attend and for how long," says regina ip, a politician who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perceptions could harm investment.
China's state media has also reported in recent days that portray democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents run by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, with 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
Pre-election agitation?
The League in Jihlava wears the name after the political movement
Approximately 1,600 amateur athletes play small football in the regional town of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is now called Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after one movement that is going to the October municipal elections.
In addition, jan Mráka, the head of small football in Jihlava, is the tenth on his list.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem with it," said Mráka.
The situation around the first league of small football has already been dealt with by the lawyers of jihlava city hall and recommended changing the system of distribution of subsidies.
Little football received about a million crowns last year, according to the city's website.
This year, it's in the hundreds of thousands.
In the legal opinion, the procedure of small football is not contrary to the law or the municipal guidelines.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for the allocation of grants and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, a spokesman for the municipality.
Drawing subsidies from the city while expressing support as a small football support in elections to one political party is probably no longer possible.
Highland "big" football has not yet received a similar demand from politicians.
That, for example, the ČSSD regional championship, ods division or KDU-ČSL 1 would be created.
And class and similar competitions?
I wouldn't be in for it.
On the contrary, I would like to see company sponsors contact us," commented Miroslav Vrzáček, Chairman of the Regional Football Association.
The head of small football of another party and movement will not allow the name of the league into the title
According to the players of small football, this sport in Jihlava deserves its own complex with six playgrounds, changing rooms and sanitary facilities.
"For example, the Na Climbs course is not ours, we are renting there," said Ondřej Lapeš from the Starlet Jihlava club.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
In my opinion, however, a nonsensical area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava, will be built there," said Mráka.
The mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small football team uses artificial grass playgrounds in rošický and na climbs streets, which are owned by the city.
We want to build playgrounds that have maximum use.
We are preparing to modernize or build sports grounds near schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think a lot of progress has been made for small football in recent years," he added.
According to Jan Mráky, other political parties in the names of leagues will not appear.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field joins us in a partnership, we don't put the other one there anymore," he explained.
"I consider the political movement in the name of the league to be an unfortunate step, to say the least," said Karel Voldán, a member of the City Council Committee for Sport.
"But let the voters evaluate whether Mr. Mráka is using the Little Football Association jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition percess into university life - freshmen can fly jets
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the uk's first luxury travel service for students.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or cars such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service has a security side.
Service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to dragg their stuff across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
With our VIF (very important fresher) variants this year, we look forward to ensuring that students arrive at university with a minimum of nervousness and maximum luxury.
A company spokesman said that as services have only just started, they don't have any reservations yet, but added, "Students will start booking in the next few weeks."
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of £9,000, they expect the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, today's students are different in terms of expectations and wishes - it is more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to do it.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unassable.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the Higher Education Union, said: "For most students, such a project is unassuable.
Many students starting university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before throwing away thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting into college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising cost of basic needs.
Feminists oppose racism and police behavior after events in Ferguson
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
Those waiting for the funeral with their hands up chant, "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz has seen a shift in the internet debates of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender over race.
With tensions rising in the Midwest that have attracted national press attention, Peres has noticed that the reaction of white women is 100% focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of black women soon after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines like "white women's reflection on Ferguson" or "Feminism isn't just about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
According to Peres, however, this represents an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privilege at that level," she said.
People felt they had to have a say in what happened.
It's characteristic of the crisis we're facing because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially motivated that they had to point it out.
According to Koritha Mitchell, an English professor at Ohio State University, Ferguson has brought to light the problems that African-American women face every day and that are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post funny stories about living with my partner on Facebook, and it gets 150 likes from people all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about people of color being trapped in their own country, it's deafening silence.
"How is it possible for a woman to speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in public spaces?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have addressed the issue of race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
Black women, she said, could not afford the luxury of clearly dividing these problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although white women now merge the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason was in almost all cases of white woman rape," Hattery said.
You needed the cooperation of white women to justify the lynching.
According to Hattery, the split between white women and black women came when suffrage campaigners like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have the right to vote.
"They decided to bet their cards on women's suffrage and focus on the right for blacks later," Hattery said.
When we realize that, we get an important insight into why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to organize against lynchings at the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first ask for help.
According to Mitchell, the upsuauce of white feminists' responses to the issues that have arisen in Ferguson - the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" on issues that black women have faced for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists in these spaces [of traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they did the right to contraception?"
The second wave of feminists who have made a career fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now figuring out what that means.
Two weeks after Michael Brown was shot dead, prominent feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took to Facebook to post a column by the Guardian's Rebecca Carroll, which called for white Americans to protest racism more vigorously.
"I hope that women who have different but still similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society - and views of race, which differ greatly in opinion polls - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem espouses intersectal feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the issue of race in America confuse some people.
Christina Sommers, an american enterprise institute expert and author of "Who Stole Feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson face criticism she has drawn before.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it elicited angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only issue that is coming to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. Border Patrol detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of immigration law reform has resuappeamed - this time as a woman's question.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to make the issue necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercad says.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position to be vulnerable when it comes to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have resonance in women's organizations," she said.
Pig's residence in Ipswich for sale
A real estate agency removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was posted, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
The one-bedroom detached house, for sale for £120,000, is on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photos included a picture of the living room, in which a pig rests with his head on the sofa.
Real estate agency Connells said that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owners.
"The photo was taken by mistake and has therefore already been removed," said an office spokesman.
In real estate information, Connells Real Estate described the former prayer room as "a unique detached one-room house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the Southwest
A lottery player in Harvey gets a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in Perth's southeast, with one lucky man taking home $1.1 million from Saturday's lottery campaign.
Newsagents in Harvey were lucky to split their fortunes for the second time in five years, the last time it was a $1 million prize in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has yet to register.
Store owner Steve Forward said the whole town in Perth's southwest was talking about winning.
It's a major topic, and everyone's upset.
We thought a win like that was a touch.
Eight winners split one win in Western Australia last month, rounding off a happy few weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five August millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier, the belmont couple had won a whopping $7.5 million.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said that winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
Millionaire Harvey is the 59th single lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Train drivers want higher wages
In a press release, the GDL called the protest a warning strike for which it deliberately chose off-peak hours.
The chosen strike time takes into account the many people who return by rail from the weekend only during the first working day.
At the same time, our thoughts are also with commuters during the day," the union said in a press release monday morning announcing the strike.
"Our first strike should hit freight transport in particular, less passengers," GDL added.
DB has not yet released an official response to the strike announcement.
It is also unclear how the protest will affect international rail links, including the Czech Republic.
The union is demanding a five percent increase in train drivers' wages and a two-hour-a-week reduction in working hours.
At present, the average salary of train drivers varies between 36,000 and 46,000 euros (998,000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
Db train drivers work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept pay increases while reducing working hours.
In doing so, they stress that the wage assessment of train drivers must evolve in the same way as for other railway staff for whom DB does not count on shortening the working week.
Krest's car was in danger of caught fire.
That's why he ended up at the Barum rally.
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was brand new, so I didn't even think anything like this would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be temporarily repaired and continued at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we'd gone straight there, yes.
But we still had two more erzets to go, and we couldn't.
It has a high temperature and the risk of the car starting to burn was great.
I can't afford that.
You've passed five speed trials at full speed.
How did they make you feel?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't go through the vint.
It was all caused by the fact that we had been driving the car for over half a year to be at some level.
The race showed that we succeeded.
You got it going so you could realistically think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car in such a way that we really had what it took to win.
The job didn't go to waste.
On the other hand, the result we could have thought of did not come.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the tech said no.
You weren't the only one at the top who prematurely withdrew from the race for the top spot.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi also dropped out.
Were you surprised that so many favorites resigned?
yes.
Especially for the spectators, it was a pity, because the race ended prematurely.
Jaromír Tarabus, to whom you are preparing a car, also moved to the top for a long time.
But he paid the price for flying off the track and 100 minutes of manko.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the podium.
He was driving the first two times.
But even Mira confirmed that we prepared the car well.
He was going really fast.
Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of riding make you a regular rally participant again?
Certainly not at the moment.
I said last year that Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't follow it.
I've decided to go again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's a chance again next year, I think I'll do it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just for you.
Did that please you?
To a certain extent, it was because of them that we started.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team continues.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't do much damage.
In addition, he wants to borrow fabia Honza Sýkora from us for this race.
Mira and I have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
To do that, we're going to have to get things ready for next year.
Can you give me a hint now?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsice Rally was part of the World Championships, you reached your highest point in the series there.
Not ingable to try the tracks there again?
It doesn't.
Oral agreement with the employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you did not get a certificate of incapacity for work from your doctor, which serves as evidence for the organization that you cannot perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify your employer of the absence.
Subsequently, it was agreed that the days in question would be registered as holidays, but the agreement was only done orally.
Although the Labour Code does not require the employer's consent to take leave to be confirmed in writing, in practice this procedure has worked.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, can be denied and absence from work can be considered as a long-term unexcused absence, hence the reason for the immediate termination of employment pursuant to Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute with your employer, you lack demonstrable evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been cancelled pursuant to § 53, only you have the given days listed in the credit sheet as an unexcused absence.
The unexcused absence from the credit note does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. the impossibility of taking material unemployment insurance), yet it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have it confirmed in writing that there has indeed been an accident that has left you incapable of working (it is not a so-called "incapacitation", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and early notification to the employer or the request of written consent to take leave.
This will avoid any complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his return to the track
Returning to the track ended just behind half of Atlanta Motor Speedway for Tony Stewart.
Stewart hit the fence for the second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172, and the race was over for him.
Stewart drove the damaged car to the garage, didn't comment to reporters, and left.
His team leader Chad Johnston said the No.14 team is disappointed, but will now focus on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I want us to have a better performance and a better finish," Johnston said.
We'll go to Richmond and hope we do better there.
Stewart hit the fence for the first time in a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Busch that required repairing the right side of his car.
"We had hopes of a good finish to today's race," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed up and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend, and to do that, he needed to win either the Atlanta race or the next race in Richmond to catch up with a spot in the table.
He returned to racing during the investigation into a tragic accident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who ran into Stewart during a race.
Authorities said it would take at least another two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm cheers before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, worked his way up to 10th at the start of the race, and then even to 4th place.
Then, at the start of lap 122, Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, came out of the second corner and hit Stewart, sending both cars into the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague chooses new taxi habitat administrators, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for new taxi station administrators.
For 103 parking spaces, it receives approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until recently, she collected CZK 150,000 a year for the same taxi drivers' seats.
Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09) informed about this.
Previously, the city used draws to select administrators.
The winner then obtained a lease for a lump sum of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently decided.
"A year after the denunciation of the original lease agreements and the opening of tenders, it has been proven that the new rental system is much more advantageous and fairer for Prague overall," says the councillor.
The most expensive spot is in Persian
The highest price was offered by those interested in the site in Na Perštýně street.
They pay CZK 2.1 million a year.
Approximately CZK 1.5 million was paid by the new administrators for seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for renting taxi stations were adopted by councillors in the autumn of 2012 and terminated the original leases in the summer of last year.
Tenders were held in four waves and 29 stations were found by the new administrator.
For the second time this year, we had to clean a well.
We released the whole one each time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured the Savo.
Unbelievable stench!
Our well in the cellar always had enough wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't technically done, grandpa dug it up on his own.
A long time ago.
She was only for three scroog and, overall, quirky, like everything else in the cabin, but like I said.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed to us that the water didn't smell.
We were wondering if anything fell in.
In the place where the pump passed, it was possible with a bit of bad luck, there the board did not quite reach, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing visible in the water, and we shone it to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a sticky package of bones on the ground.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further away.
Now it looked like a drenched mouse.
By the ceiling, where there are vi trches, Grandpa's invention, there were remnants of fish!
And heavy- and heavy!
Our basement is quirky, too.
Some would say grandpa just dug up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and floor are just smourdated sand, only the ceiling is understeered.
It's mostly boats.
And wheels.
And sun loungers for the beach.
The door with wide gaps was mostly open, as someone used to go there all the time.
Several of the aforementioned viors at the ceiling.
Without a net, so birds normally fly there and build nests on the beams.
It is useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to be lufted, and it did.
Now, however, even luft did not help.
The whole basement smelled.
So we cleaned the whole cellar.
Especially the fish on the water was nutritious!
We also threw away the things that were around: boards, heraculity boards, that kind of thing.
Our cottage welcomed passersby remotely with a disinfectant odor.
We were wondering, who could have pulled the disgusting leftovers in there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers away in the house.
She'd hardly come to our place to have a suve.
Grandpa was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite right.
Did he put that Franta in there?
He's been here practically all year round, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to guard the cellar and well and check it regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, just for washing and washing until the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water out of a forest well is not something I want to do for a long time.
We once heard the terrible anxious barking of our.
My mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass next to the porch.
The vine was bouncing over her and squealing like crazy.
Mom reviled her because she thought Reza had dug a garbage hose out of the sink.
But suddenly the hose partially entangled in a ball and partially updid.
There was a hiss on the balcony.
The vine had a hysterical fit.
We ran down.
The snake, well over a meter long and fat as a bullfighter, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Reza prevented her from doing so.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the outshot form of our whole family, she probably told us to eat it when we were so hungry, and she elegantly stretched her through the vent into the cellar.
We went to see her.
Like lightning, she jumped behind a well.
By the way, we noticed another smelly package on her record.
From the smell, I think it's a fish.
She wasn't there the day before yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a swindler.
And we locked the basement during the day.
That he would...
We went out, and there we each lay down to one vi er vi pass.
We didn't wait long.
It's sheming behind the well.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow periodes around its neck.
Then a whole snake swwed up the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to conquer inside.
Fired employee retaliated, bought laptops for the company and sold them
After his dismissal, the scorned employee bought computers for the company and then sold them.
He managed to spend the money before he was apprehended by the police.
In a short period of time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"After taking over, he took the laptops to Olomouc, where he sold them in bazaars," said Rostislav Brückner, Chief Commissioner of the Šumperk Police.
The motive for the fraud was to resemnit the employer for dismissal and also to make money.
"When questioned, he told us that he had used the money to pay off loans," Brückner said.
Police also discovered that the fraudster was a pathological gambler who had been repeatedly treated in a psychiatric hospital.
The money could also end up in winning machines or video terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money on him," the commissioner said.
The fraudster, who has already been convicted of theft once, now faces a prison sentence of one to five years.
Police have not yet said whether bazaars that bought and continued to sell laptops are also facing punishment.
"It is true that they were taking on brand new goods, which is suspicious to say the least," the Commissioner stated.
However, none of the bazaar owners have yet been charged.
Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared several changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route, which brought the destination to the embankment instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race with the rest Rungo.cz the team, but I was going to experience it a bit from the other side.
The whole team and I decided to personally greet our readers at the booth where we took pictures and videos together.
To bring my view from the other side to perfection, I accepted the role of personal conductor.
Together with my friend Káťa, we obediently joined the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before takeoff.
We greeted our friends who walked past us to the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A few minions to warm up, turn on the sportstesters, countdown and start!
Cries of cheers, but instead of a quick start, there was a squear to the starting line.
After five minutes, we approach the gate, turn on the measurements, and start at a pace of ten for an hour.
We weave through the yellow snake of runners who, like Kaťa, run their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vyšehrad almost a cheesy touch.
The throbbing masses stretching along the waterfront look as if all of Prague is running here.
On the waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally starting to show who has how many forces.
The light hill on Palacký Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before the crossing to Theatrical I see a police escort and right behind him Vítek Pavlišta flies at an incredible pace to the finish line.
I hear the admiring smourding sighs of the other runners.
I'm moving to the edge of the track, cheering him on, he's going to high-five me, but just before that, my leg spraints and our hands miss.
The run down Theatrical Street gives you a chance for a short rest and breath.
We need places in front of us where the views will take my breath away.
The turn on mánes bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are carrying me almost alone.
There's a moment of truth behind the first refreshment.
As he crosses the road, Káťa clambers against the curb and performs the jump in a swim.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm launching a series of words of encouragement so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and we continue down Goat Lane, it is one of the narrowest places on the track, at this stage of the race there is no such rush, but it is still necessary to keep a good eye on the surroundings.
I don't know yet that the term narrowest place will take its true meaning later.
Behind the Dusty Gate, we are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to clap with anyone who offers a hand, and I advise Kate to do that, because ten clapping with the fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we're accelerating again, and even though we've fallen pretty far, now the pursuit has begun.
We're getting ahead of dozens of runners when I pass someone particularly tired, trying to cheer them up with a few words: "Come on, just a little bit more, you can do it!"
No one's getting ahead of us behind the last refreshment, we're accelerating.
So far we've run for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish line will hurt, but you really need to do a little work.
The sun has already set slowly, and the end of the day symbolically ends the race.
Last run to the bridge, a turn and just a straight to the finish.
The pace we're running, I wonder where that girl's got it?
"Come on, we're going under an hour thirteen, we're working!"
We try, we sprint, and there's a target.
An hour thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set the limit for an hour and twenty.
So seven minutes under schedule.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the finish line, Kate's legs are breaking, helping her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
You can see exhaustion, but also happiness from a well-off performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of target space.
Euphoria doesn't make us think about the crowd in the locker room passages.
You can see here that Goat Lane wasn't the narrowest place.
That's right here at the finish line, which is crammed into a bursting water under the onslaught of nearly 10,000 runners.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's not the place for them.
After a while, I lose my head and wonder if the beautiful views and the more interesting route compared to previous years were worth what is happening at the finish.
I know from personal experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people join in, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year's change of route showed runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in the Yellow Spa was carried over to the runners even in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators escalated it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, when running through the historical centre, obstacles that cannot be removed must be taken into account, but I do not consider the aim of the mass race in a place bordered on one side by a wall and on the other by a river to be the best solution.
If I tell myself that the race ended with a run of finishes, I rate it as very good.
For the goal, I was a little worried about the health of those involved, but in the end everything turned out well.
Write to us in the discussion if you liked the route and what you think about the situation at the finish line.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison service employees across Bulgaria took part in a nationwide protest rally outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their call for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
The list of demands to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov also includes higher salaries.
For a month, the guards symbolically protested against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original 24-hour shifts.
Although the prison guards' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, The Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) reported.
"Negotiations are still ongoing," Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the Directorate-General for Prison Service, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Employees' Unions at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of prison service employees.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we can't see them
Physicists don't usually write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University managed to hit the jackpot in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the web of problems that many theoretical physicists are now engaged in - an effort to unify two perfectly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general relativity theory.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the search for a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the fundamental problem between two key theories (for at the moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) and solve it so imaginatively that it is worth retelling even to lay people.
Moreover, Greene handled the complex material so freshly and engagingly that he cannot be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
Moreover, he largely corrected his "mistake" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Perhaps even the author would object if his book became obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything that an informed layman with the ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little more lively in this area (perhaps because the LHC accelerator will finally go at "full throttle"), so it is a good time to enter green's non-violently open door of the world of modern physics.
How big can our universe be?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound foolish, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
Nevertheless, it is specific and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let us turn our eyes away from the universe as a whole for a moment to something more grounded, namely a long and thin garden watering hose.
Imagine stretching a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scenery from a half-kilometer away (as shown and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily notice a long horizontally stretched hose, but if you are not suffering from austereness, you can hardly tell the thickness of the hose.
Due to its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which to walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you answer it with only one reading: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we're saying is that from a half-kilometer away, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle winding a hose.
In such an enlarged view, it is clear that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of movement of the clock hands", that is, around the circular cut-out of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant, you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where there is a rotating hose on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note, experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on faulty string theory.
Chapters 12 and 13 discuss the non-disruptive aspects.
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, a dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked with a circular arrow, is short and coated.
However, there is a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the circumference of the hose is short, "ent still" and less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important feature of spatial dimensions.
That they're divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly noticeable, or, on the contrary, small, rolled up and much harder to see.
Of course, in this case, we didn't exactly pre-indust to reveal the "ent still" dimension of the hose thickness.
All you had to do was bring binoculars to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillaries - we would only reveal the entased dimension with great effort.
Kaluza sent an article to Einstein in 1919, in which he came up with the astounding idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three known dimensions for all of us.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by saying that the additional dimension provides an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be weaped into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how kaluz's observation goes together with the obvious fact that we see precisely three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly expressed and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls, claiming that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and coated dimensions.
This means that, like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of at any moment.
But by analogy with the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe may also have additional dimensions, tightly rolled into a space so tiny that it has so far remained hidden from even our most sophisticated experimental apparatuses.
To get a clearer idea of the nature of Kaluz's remarkable design, let's stick to the hose for a little while longer.
Imagine drawing a rather dense series of circles on the circumference of the hose in black.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, thanks to the drawing, we will now reveal the ent still dimension even more often, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension, it has three large spatial dimensions, together four space dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imaginations a little, let us note the illustration in Figure 3; shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the figure, we increase the view of the geometry of the space similar to how we enlarted the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in space geometry from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them on the fourth level of magnification) if they are enammed into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet observed them directly.
The square mesh represents commonly known "large" dimensions, while the circle represents a new, tiny and rang dimension.
Just like thread loops in a densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we just drew them to the intersections in the square mesh for illustration.
The background of Figure 4 shows the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - at such common scales as the meters shown by the side of a small square in a square mesh.
In each of the following images, we will focus on the small area of the image preceding; we'll enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first few levels of enlargement.
However, as we move on to the microscopic properties of space geometry - the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we suddenly see a new, circle-shaped, coated dimension, similar to thread loops in a densely weased piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists in every place in the direction of large dimensions, similar to the hose has a circular circumference at each point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have drawn a circular dimension only in some regularly placed points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity to the hose is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), whereas the hose has only one large size.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just an object within the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly entrant dimension is extremely miniature, recognizing it - as well as the circular circumference of the hose - is much harder than observing obvious, large and large dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will in fact be revealed beyond the power of our state-of-the-art magnification tools.
Most importantly, the additional dimension is not just a round bump within normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
A circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at each point of three common large dimensions.
It is the dimension on the other three dimensions independent, as are the dimensions from top-down, left-right and front-back independent (and perpendicular) to each other.
A small enough ant could move in all four dimensions, and we would need four data to determine its position, in addition to the three usual positions in the circular dimension; if we also calculate time, then data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is CZK 149.
To our surprise, however, we find that, although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional coated dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe may well be more sized than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
State-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize structures of a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
Smaller rolled-up dimensions can barely be observed.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with some ideas from just-nascent quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could be about one Planck length, far beyond the distinguishing capabilities of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluz-Klein's theory.
Wohne Honza Homola advises on how to practice on electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in a twelve-stroke harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Those who are in the dark about musical theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
Educated as a puppeteer and puppeteer whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, he has been living as a graphic designer since graduating 20 years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohne, from which, unfortunately, it is impossible to leave.
The guitarist is his father, as is brother Matěj, leader of the Wohnes.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can invent anything, just apply it to the harmonic model of twelve," advises Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what can be done with twelve harmony on two strings and how nice it is starting to sound.
If you take the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of a song.
When you finally add a fourth, beware of changing tuning, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will go back to pentatonics and try to put it together with a 12-year-old.
Then practice it honestly.
As best you can read in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school of electric guitar playing here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, acknowledges Dvorak of Hradec Králové
We take a point and we are happy for it.
We had more chances in the first half, the home side had more chances," said the striker, who scored from a penalty kick this time.
You weren't nervous playing it, but it was accompanied by a great whistling?
I didn't really notice it, although for a second goal where the home fans are, it would probably be worse.
You equalised after half an hour with a penalty, but you also got the goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We overslept the start, we were passive, it made a corner and then a penalty.
After that, you got up and the first half you were the better team with more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
It's hard to tell.
I agree that we played well after the goal we scored until the break.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep up the pace of the game after that, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the home team said something about their game at the break, they probably weren't very happy with it.
It's only the first time you've scored on your opponent's field, whereas at home you may not have scored a goal yet.
Why is it so different?
I don't think it's that different, it's up to us how we deal with it.
We got off to a good start in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, that's a different category.
Four games you waited for a goal, weren't you worried that it might be similar after the last game?
Not really, but of course we're glad we haven't had to listen to talk about waiting for a goal since the last game.
Now we've added another without waiting, but they're still only three in six games, which isn't enough for a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a crater miles away.
Lava flowing to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a crater miles away.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact worries scientists the most...
For the time being, the situation remains unchanged.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) approximately the same amount of lava still flows out of the fissure.
However, compared to the original estimates, its amount is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption on August 29, 2008, the number of people who had been in the state of the world was 100.00.
2014 is up to 50 times larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open even where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, with an intensity similar to that demonstrated by the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river and on other rivers.
A strong stench of the stench of the stench can be smelled around the eruption, clouds of steam and gases rise from the crack.
It is certainly not a tourism-appropriate eruption, as was the case with the Fimmvörðuháls eruption in 2010.
This is much larger and there are a lot more gases," says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost windless in the area in the early hours of the morning.
Traces of the sandstorm were brushed off by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange stage (second highest) applies to Bárðarunga and the yellow (third) to Askja.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings
Air day in Cheb.
The Boeing Stearman PT-17 featured aerobate Peggy Walentin, who climbed out of the cockpit to the bar on the upper wing of the biplane and also between the wings.
There she is relied only on the strength of the muscles.
The air day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers again managed to prepare several interesting pieces of air.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was not only "wing walk" performed by German acrobat Peggy Walentin, but also the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or the Beechcraft 18.
He attracted attention with his bright cover.
An acrobatics called Wingwalking originates in the USA.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to assert themselves.
But due to the large number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the air days program.
Peggy climbs out of the cockpit to the top wing after takeoff.
That's where he performs all sorts of exercises.
Towards the end of the performance, she will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," said Luděk Matějíček from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the subsequent performance of the Mustang fighter was the famous icing on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the surface with grippens of the Army of the Czech Republic in tow (so-called numbers).
This is the first time that aviation fans in the Czech Republic have seen such a line-up.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then performed breathtaking acrobatics with the aircraft from 1945.
It was made during the war, but probably never participated in it.
He was assigned to the Army Reserves.
Since 1963 he has been active in the civil sphere.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today it has its home hangar at Munich Hradiště Airport.
In the same place is also another pearl of Cheb Air Day, the twin-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, the mighty machine could not be overlooked.
Its polished aluminum cover shone into the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force also gained admiration.
A small airliner jumped behind the reschedule Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from Hof, Germany, for air day.
In Cheb, German neighbors demonstrated with reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft or a three-man formation of Bücker Jungmann biplanes.
Lucie Borhyová: Dramatic return to the camera!
Lucie Borhyová traded her parenting worries for the work ones at least for tonight.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde presenter clearly doesn't know any of this.
She was doing well on tv news, as if she didn't stop with him for two months!
It is only two weeks since the blonde ended a six-week period in which women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
Lucie, however, will not be appearing regularly in tv nova's main news session.
According to the information, she will return Blesk.cz in a month.
After all, her daughter Linda needs her now more than tv viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the tv screen and it was a shot in the arm.
Exhibitions for a year in Prague?
The hall would sell out, he's planning a bachelor party Jágr
It would be dignified if something like this were done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union handles it," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called The Golden Match, in which the stunning Nagano team reunited.
Even the players who participated in the golden hat-trick.
The players would have a taste, wouldn't they?
definitely.
It would simply be good to bid farewell to the golden generation during the Championships.
In my opinion, during the tournament you can find one or two days when it is completely free and where such a match could be meddly.
We will tell Gum (Jiří Šlégr) or Béď Ščerban (organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play New Jersey in the playoffs?
Well, if I'm going to fly in like this...
But you don't want to play in the national team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting alter your decision in any way?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and performances are decisive in the national team.
It's one thing for people to want to see me there, but performances are crucial, especially at the World Cup.
That's where players who can do it should go, not because they have a good reputation.
My decision hasn't changed.
How did you enjoy the Nagano reunion, in the first place?
The meeting with the players was great.
You've brought your stories back to life and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was the tribute to Ivan Hlinka.
And it's good to remind you of the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving that was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the bench.
Can you still remember your first representative match?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against the Calgary Flames, and three young ones: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, started in one threesome.
It was everyone's first representative start.
Well, there's no way to say we're dominating.
In Jihlava, After a long time, Dominik Hašek was catching.
What did you think of his performance?
Hashan never surprises me on the ice.
I wanted to return the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagr for the reasons why he decided to quit the national team). He just caught it very well.
Even Hnilička put on a great show.
He was training with me one night, and there he was leaky.
And now he's been catching well.
First the USA and then the Netherlands, the soccer team starts qualifying
Prominent guests came to smíchov's NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could see goalkeeper Petr Cech from Chelsea, national coach Pavel Vrba...
And over there, the figure in the black cap, that's Tomas Rosicky!
The Arsenal midfielder and national team captain arrived at the meeting around 11.30pm.
We have a beautiful match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be looking forward to it?" he said, as he appeared before reporters in the representative set.

Wednesday, September 3 Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letná)
Tuesday, September 9 Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letná) end of meeting
Rosicky and Co. can be supported by fans before Wednesday's game against the USA (8:15 p.m.
The national team opened Tuesday's training for them, which starts at Letná at 18:30.
And this will be followed by an autograph session, which rosicky and the Czech will not miss.
Otherwise, however, this national team meeting will be calmer.
This is praised by Coach Vrba, who has just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
We're finally going to focus on what we want to do.
Now we're going to focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We'll have time to rehearse things that haven't been spent that much time," said Vrba, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The national team has played three matches under Willow, all preparatory.
They drew 2-2 with Norway and Finland and lost 1–2 to Austria.
However, these results were not yet important.
That's only now.
The match against the Netherlands will kick off the qualification for the 2016 European Championships.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if they could do a dress rehearsal against the USA.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player on the 23-man nomination with health problems is forward David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he doesn't make it to Wednesday's game against the U.S., Coach Willow would call up one more striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how, after a misdiagnosis, she thought she was going to die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence under the notion that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
Around 23,000 people in the UK are thought to suffer from CMT, which can manifest symptoms in the motor skills sector such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
In those affected, numbness or pain may also occur, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms get worse.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's ataxia (FA) - a condition that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she celebrated her 18th birthday, she'd be wheelchair bound and dead by the time she was 30.
The mother-of-two, who is now 51, says: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as everyone else.
I fell every day and everything took me longer.
I could never roller skate or skateboard with other kids, and I was bullied at school because of the way I walked and ran."
When Rodgers was 13 and had several surgeries to clear her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor's leave of the room and looked into her documentation, where she learned she was suffering from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping around, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the illness in the library and wrote to the FA Association," she says.
When they answered me, I was shocked, completely panicked.
I thought by the time I was 18, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd gradually lose all my powers.
I was all alone, planning a funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she had anticipated, and asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her and said, "Sweetheart, I don't think you have the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it's going to be something much less life-threatening."
After undergoing several genetic tests, it was discovered that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of fortune," she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of cmt awareness to draw attention to the disease.
Washington-area entrepreneurs: taxes rise as the economy turns
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country grew slightly last year as the economy recovered, and firms in Washington were no exception.
Together, entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia paid $27.6 billion to state and local coffers for fiscal 2013, 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden - both state and local - rose 4.3% last year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9% last year, the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were cut.
According to a study conducted by ernst &young, a professional firm, and the center on state taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than local levies, by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56%, is from business tax, and 36% of Maryland's revenue is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, has proportionally the lowest tax revenue from business.
Researchers say that the majority of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of corporate properties, which has increased property taxes by 3.7% this year after three consecutive years of -1% growth.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York, and Texas, washington seems to be in the same situation.
Companies in D.C., Maryland, and Vriginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, an annual increase of 4.2% compared to $9.6 billion in 2012.
But the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not drive up state and local tax revenues so much in Maryland, where real estate taxes represent less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property taxes represent nearly half of state and local taxes.
"In Maryland, a lot of real estate is owned by companies, especially the D.C. tax base, the government, or nonprofit organizations that don't pay taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business income also appears to be increasing.
Companies in the region posted a corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average of 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia only, the tax increase was below average, at 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of all three districts (all of which have the same taxation), 6%.
Maryland's corporate tax rate is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and an overall more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C study did not evaluate.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces pressure from competition from the South.
North Carolina recently signed a bill lowering corporation tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and will reduce the tax to 5% next year.
If the state continues to meet revenue targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could fall to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better, and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Business tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax - a structure to offset cost increases by raising prices, according to which most companies are organized - rose 20% last year in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers say the trend and nationwide increases in business tax are likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for state and local governments rising to 6.2% over the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may lag behind others, because reducing state spending is taking its toll on the labor market.
What you missed: Tusk, Putin's Novorusko and Lafat's scissors will be europe's chief
Will a new state be created in Ukraine?
Putin calls for negotiations on Novoruska
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeast Ukraine, where government troops have clashed with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European firms that they would have a difficult return to the Russian market after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions.
The Support provided to the West by the War of the Ukrainian Army in eastern Ukraine, he argues, is contrary to democratic values.
According to him, ending the conflict depends on Kiev, so it cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has claimed the right to disagree with part of it
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is due to propose a further incursion of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, an EU summit decided last night.
Herman Van Rompuy, permanent chairman of the member states' meetings, told reporters.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to shift the form of sanctions are due as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the eu's new "president."
Van Rompuy will be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to head the European Council at the European Union summit, the so-called EU president who manages member countries' summits.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years from December.
Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini will replace Catherine Ashton at the head of European diplomacy.
The Italian, who will become Vice-President of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, it is just not talked about
Help an incurable and long-suffering patient to leave life?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not allow euthanasia, this is not legal.
Nevertheless, it is clear from the comments of the doctors who have approached LN that they hear about such requests.

According to him, it is clear that "the harsh sanctions imposed with regard to the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army."
Moreover, according to the legislator, the CIA manuscript is known.
Impossible promises.
Elections are coming up, and parties are once again offering the impossible

Joan Rivers' family: "We keep our fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a new york city hospital, but her daughter said today that she's not losing hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your kindest and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're keeping our fingers crossed.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to emergency services that said she went into cardiac arrest at yorkwill endoscopy on the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under close supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains "serious.".
The reactions didn't last long, including incredible online support from celebrities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is distorted by subtitles
That the media distorts reality with its subtitles is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know that the headlines "sell" newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who read nothing else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, the more apt is the word annoys me.
This applies in particular to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel attacked Gaza" are commonplace.
Only in the text will you read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often at the time of the declared ceasefire.
This will then appear with the headline "Both sides have violated the ceasefire".
Does the journalistic community realise that in doing so, it is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are increasing throughout Europe (and not only there) ?
Sixty years have passed since the end of World War II.
There are still survivors of Shoah.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans "Jewish schmeming" and similar infidelity, I was left with a backing.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews, the Sedibles were destined to be destroyed?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as the "watchdogs of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its people.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbours decides to destroy the Czech nation and remove the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also be aware of one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the state of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don't go among their "own", like Gaza, they answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security, and top-notch health care (I myself have seen arabs go to the top private hadassa hospital, which is funded by donations from Jews around the world, and are understandably treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
Gaza's only real help, and thus this restless region, is to rid it of Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
Report on Hamas's practices, its abuse of people as human shields.
Report that Hamas aims to destroy the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the deaths of innocent Arab children.
Inform us that Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Report that in nine years of self-government in Gaza, the region could be thriving thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, for which gaza's administrators do not pay, and even angry that power supplies are sometimes cut off at this time.
If Hamas had not invested money in the construction of underground tunnels so that suicide bombers could penetrate israel, but, for example, in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals, and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would be much better off.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed Information's claim monday morning: The online retailer - a video producer and hundreds of other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement caused surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, Google's $1 billion twitch sales seemed certain, and that connection seemed natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago by Justin.tv, was on the move to become a widely used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to broadcast online game streams to it - in the words of Business Insider's "YouTube for live gaming."
Twitch interaface.
YouTube already has popular "Let's play" videos, a kind where mugglers (mostly older) give games a version of Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes up with a lot when describingTwitch, so the news that YouTube is buyingTwitch didn't excite anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company pays off a possible competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we currently have is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision, and wants to help us deliver faster."
Another mystery is - frankly - twitch's incredible success.
For snobs like me who say they prefer to do sports rather than watch it, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about just watching games instead of actually playing.
It's one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder play Resident Evil at 3:00 in the morning, and it's another thing to watch a stranger get 20 hits in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from a player's perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that speed run games, in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age finish the game in record time, is fun.
But if someone is not a master of acting or humor, their Twitch channel probably won't be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is fourth at the peak of internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon take advantage of this?
It's hard to imagine Twitch meddling in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as you could have swallowed it from YouTube.
But Twitch has something every business would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch "believe in the future of games" and the media doesn't seem reluctant, even as - swallowed - viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation by american atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on the theme of "The Holy Scriptures are God's word."
The original video is attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that conflict with their religion, they often ask us the question: Who will you trust?
The supposed word of God or the word of man?
It's as if human exploration is completely inequest compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to the "word of God," they refer to myths about God written by men.
If there really is an intelligent creator with a purpose, then he is the one who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who has supplied further lines of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
He seems to be trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabula.
And it was the people who wrote all those lyrics that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposedly holy teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were written by none other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and least of all gods.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergénius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, a single scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not compete with such a work.
And people might not believe it blindly, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and truthful evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would permanently inspire every reader to unite their common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without common origin, and they all constantly crumble into increasingly separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, and each somehow claims God's guidance, regardless of the continuing dissent and separation in every way.
The Jewish Torah, The Christian gospels, the Islamic Koran, Bahá'u'jah's Kitab-i-Akdas, zarathushtrov's Avesta, sikh Adí-Granth, Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered "absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the one true god", and the relevant believers of each of them say that the others are averse.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is ate to some extent.
None of the above books have any advantage over the others.
None of them have evidence support, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I'm not saying I've proven that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it's not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith, as well as apologies (defenses), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities, and primitive notions once considered true that have already been overcome.
So it cannot be said that they are evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote heinous atrocities instead of morality, and many are said to have been confirmed by fulfilling prophecies - with each of them also containing prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore subject to interpretations, impressions, and perspectives of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a counter-saying, I'd call it comments on each other.
We must point out once again that we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and he's certainly not an eyewitness story!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of "Moses" and Moses do not attribute authorship to any of them, because it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (presumably by Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time, and they're all attributed to human authors.
There's no way the Bible is as old as its believers think it is.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the earliest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic voritos, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Helenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religions.
Christianity began as a gnostical faith, followed by docets and ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined in a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups like luciferians were dispeled and discredited by other revisions of the Bible.
One of these edits relates to King Ugarito, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young people of Moses, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and turned Ba'al Zebul, the "Lord on the Mountain," into Belzebub the "Lord of the Flies."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of commission decisions at the Nicaraguan Assembly.
The four gospels were received, and sixteen others were rejected simply by raising their hands, as if the reality of a thing could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of that time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter at the Jeruzalem Church?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they found themselves approaching the same gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the primordial church.
So the Council simply accepted as gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at that time.
But they also knowingly removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they were referring to books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items we find the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God's word refer us to books that are just the words of some people and/or are no longer even available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the true author of this random mix of legends, parables, and psalm lyricism?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not very enlightened, rather the opposite!
That is why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is from start to finish.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could speak, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, bewitched objects, fiery potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure them of leprosy.
We are talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and pi that was an integer.
These people believed that if they show a pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could someone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book didn't know.
If the Bible had been written by a higher being, then it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would not contain anything at all.
As a moral guide, he is completely failing because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who overlooked or supported animal cruelty, incest, slavery, slave abuse, family abuse, child abuse, child violence, abortion, pillage, murder, cannibalism, genocide, and prejudice against race, nation, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.
To justify their inhumanity by claiming to be doing God's will.
But the creationists still ignore all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't even have God.
In their world, one is the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worshipping Creation instead of creator."
But they consider the word of man to be the word of God and God himself, and even insist that the rebutting of their supposedly "holy" books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God might exist, and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate doctrine from deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were God himself because they think they're His word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their supposedly "immutable word" of any god has been invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, edited, and often deliberately altered and distorted by mere erroneous people.

Chinese school attacker stabs nine people, three of them dead
According to the New China News Agency, a man named Chen forced his way into an elementary school building this morning and attacked around 11:30 a.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in hospital.
Chen eventually killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, referring to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one child in accordance with government policy.

The youngest schoolchildren were taken by ninth graders to their classroom, where they waited with the teacher for the president to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately you don't have that anymore, you're already free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then handed the first-year girls a conundrum as a gift.

It has a sense of typography and a clean elegant design, which is the path we want to continue in the nova news visual," says Nova's creative director Alan Záruba.
Apple iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, nude celebrity images made public
Screenshot of the leaked files listing
Meanwhile, an anonymous user on 4chan is posting nude and pornographic images of American celebrities, us site Mashable.com.
He allegedly obtained them by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where disabled users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities dismiss the images as falsified, but several have already admitted to the authenticity of the images.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, best known for her title role as Katniss in the Hunger Games film series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Die Hard 4.0.
The hacker's goal is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich himself.
American magazines have reportedly expressed interest in the footage, but according to reports on 4chan, the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, this is very likely a real weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on GitHub that allowed you to obtain passwords for user accounts through brute force, i.e. by automatically repeating login attempts with different passwords.
This tool has proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
What is certain, however, is that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to different accounts before publishing this tool.
As a precautionary measure, iCloud users should change their Apple ID password.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
A length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The leak of naked celebrity images is seen as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although the servers of companies like Apple, Google, or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in homes or smaller businesses, uploading sensitive photos in an unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also wise to set up automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it only take place on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
This will give you the opportunity to move sensitive images "to safety" in a timely manner, and most importantly, you will have the space to delete failed images, so that they do not unnecessarily occupy space in the online storage.

A smart way to save on college scripts
With the cost of college scripts for many students exceeding $1,000 a year, the upcoming second-year student has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He devised a system for borrowing books from high school classmates offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
"I got a calculation book that normally costs $180 for ten and chicken nuggets for a semester," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university board, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different ways to handle those expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions like Schroeder's become students' preferred choice.
Textbook lending is on the rise, allowing students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores on campuses, says book lending has doubled since 2011.
The survey shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are bought in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Shops.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
Prices for some new books can be up to a third lower online than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson,Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" is nearly $290, but can be purchased online at Chegg.com, a textbook retail store, for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don't mind other people's notes or wear and tear, the learning texts used are a good option.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior at Brigham Young University, says Amazon.com he paid 42 cents for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The new one sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not relevant for working in seminars.
If so, older releases can sell for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's and its 1990s are also a popular alternative Half.com.
lending
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about $20 for the entire semester.
Learn about the terms and conditions of the store where you rent your book, including penalties for notes, highlighting or wear and tear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you don't return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get an e-book instead of a regular book.
Sometimes these books are essentially lent in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes &Noble Inc.
Chegg is lending "Calculus" for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, students of literary courses can find the best deals, since many classics are now available for free download, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, walk around the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start at Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees you're buying the right book.
Before ordering a book over the Internet, make sure it's really in stock, Gault advises.
He saw for himself.
The book he bought sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Mud, mud.
And then they found a torso rifle from the end of the war in the well.
The well is a short walk from St. George's Church.
We uncovered the vegetation around us and began to pull out an age-old deposit - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay bottom, we hit a barrel," said Radomil Novák.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found it torso of an attack German rifle used by SS units.
The find is said to be unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were manufactured until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," added Novak.
All wooden construction things have decomposed over time, therefore it is unusable.
However, her body is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown in by people who needed to get rid of the weapon used by the SS, probably for fear of being pushed away.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were throwing guns in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing rainbow jeseníky enthusiasts found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there used to be a lot of them all around, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully felt the mud so that no misfortune would happen, but there was nothing else down there," said Novak.
The find ends up in the museum depository at the chateau in nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian General: I have not yet freed a captured Czech
An exclusive Aktuálně.cz with Lieutenant General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Excuse me, I have to take this... I'm being called from Donetsk," Ukrainian Lieutenant General Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise director of the center for the release of prisoners of war, apologized eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz.
Lieutenant General Volodymyr Ruban in a televised debate.
With each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers, or where they were - or should be - that Ruban and his counterpart were on the other end of the phone.
"That'll be it - go there," he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk, again focusing on ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, former fighter pilot and active participant in anti-government protests in Maidan.
Yesterday - when we arranged the interview - he was in Donetsk.
He is engaged in the liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists twenty-four hours a day.
Aktuálně.cz: You may know that the Czechs are also fighting on the side of pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their numbers to be in their 30s.
But there could be many more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated serbs, Dagestanis, Chechens, one Swede, a Georgian... but not the Czech yet.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captured compatriot and we can rescue him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise czechs who join pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian volunteer battalions and are captured by the separatists, they will be shot without mercy after questioning, as will any other foreigner.
The separatists consider these men to be renting mercenaries, and they say they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Don separatists - including a Czech - they will put him behind bars and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy's just going to survive.
The Ukrainian side behaves like a state even in war.
A.cz: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand correctly, it's in exchange.
Some sources say it's already exceeded 100 men.
We stopped counting how many people we helped a long time ago.
But we just set them free... they did not save themselves from war if they choose to continue fighting.
The saviors are doctors, surgeons, but we certainly are not.
That's the way it is.
And every day, more and more come.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be a trade.
Sometimes even a human request is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: Rumor has it that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust from pro-Russian separatists... as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build the respect of both war parties?
Tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev nicknamed me "crazy general with steel balls."
I'm not offended.
And maybe it even captures the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officers' Corps, I've earned some authority before.
I never catch, cheat, and always keep my word.
No matter what, I'm being honest and telling the truth.
Even if it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or for the Donetsk or Luhansk governments.
If they torture and kill people?
So I'm simply telling them they're being toiled and killed.
And that they're crimes.
I often risk my life, even being captured in a prisoner exchange... This job could be the end for me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures do you know about?
... (long pause)... Ukrainians and separatists resort to torture of prisoners during the erming.
unfortunately.
And the executions?
These only take place on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
No indication that the Ukrainian army is committing anything like this.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I can't and won't give numbers.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
They include officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are seeking independence and perhaps democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - at least that is what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The separatists are fed up with the oligarchs and are their irredectoral opponents - to the death.
As we say, they ate them up to their throats.
By the way, people showed the same dreams and aspirations on Maidan.
And now I'm speculating a little: Russia supports the separatists, and the West supports the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large and the other to be small.
But even this sentence of mine contains an irredeciable contradiction.
A.cz: How does one of the toughest leaders of pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler, look to you?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I'm unarmed, showing soldiers or militants their bare arms.
And I'm always got both sides of that 200 or 300 meters in their sights or in an optical sight.
I can always see the faces of the people pointing a gun at me... and they can pull the trigger on their weapons at any time.
Paratrooper, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian amen.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, it's just like a small governorate in a great Russian empire.
In any case, he talks about it all the time and regards Ukraine as some sort of misunderstanding.
Such a state, he said, should not even exist.
At the same time, he is an irreplaceable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - on a Ukrainian TV talk show, you described your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk as a weak, clueless and tired "leader" who would do best to leave quickly.
I get scared at least five times every time I walk 300 meters.
So why should I hide from the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is bad for our country?
A.cz: Do you think he was part of the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians nickname Jaceňuk "rabbit".
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of Ukrainians that is fearful or has respect and authority in others.
His behavior directly follows the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, beg him, play his intrigues with him, threaten to resign... he must run the country, administer it, and protect it in times of war.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest to weeping emotions.
He is the first of ukraine's ministers.
And Jaceňuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never been strong... he doesn't fight for Ukraine, he just complains about everything all the time.
He should leave, therefore.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save revenue
Sylvester Stallone's Expendables 3 returned less than $30 million from a $90 million budget in the U.S., and Sin City: The Woman I'd Kill for returned only $12 million from a $70 million budget.
Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz grossed just $14.6 million in its first weekend, and children's films like How to Train Dragon 2 were disappointing for cinemas.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, the quality of children's films is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year of children's movies, and Called How to Train Dragon 2 a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to movies deployed to a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem isn't necessarily in the quality of the movies themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average ratings for summer movie premieres aired in at least 2,000 theaters between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both audiences and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, a change in viewer access and the increased popularity of Internet sites like Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's production of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase what's already been done.
In contrast to the current crisis in Hollywood box office, Netflix's internet service profit was $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for relying too much on comic book rights and predicted a "meltdown" in Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators say there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the release of possible big box office blockbusters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoň and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the drop in sales simply "cyclical." He told The Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer is going to be the biggest blockbuster in history, and no one's going to worry about selling."
DPRK threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has fired another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul announced.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the conclusion of joint military maneuvers by the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparation for an invasion.
Zhang Province lies in the northwest of the KDLR on the border with China.
According to DPA, a spokesman for South Korea's Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from a location in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers (125 miles).
North Korea may have fired a missile from Zhang Province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
The province is said to have an underground launch pad for Scud missiles.
It is another in a series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in an anti-NATO march.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for what has been described as an anti-summit meeting.
Stephen Fairclough monitored the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be airlifted from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went hiking in Govetts Leap, Blackheath, after noon on Sunday.
When they didn't return home, concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m.
A search party, including local police and a rescue team, was dispatched and the couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11 p.m.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition.
Olomouc only brought a point from Opava, the win was on the leg of Vasek
It was the 23-year-old forvard who could make the decision, but failed in the two best chances.
The goal was mainly called for by a close-range shot three minutes before the end, but the spot in the net ended up on Opava goalkeeper Josef Květoň.
I had it on my leg, I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," said Vasek, thinging the ashes on his head.
"I probably should have put it under the lid, it went down a little bit," he mused.
Sigma's defense didn't allow much for Opava, with the exception of Mikulov's 11th-minute raid, which was covered by goalkeeper Reichl.
After that, the Hanaks started to push, but they did not let them into the chances in the block defending the home team, and the shots from a distance were caught by Květoň.
We compared each other for 15 minutes, then took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more out of the game and Opava only threatened us from standard situations.
But vasek didn't convert the chance, so it ended 0-0," regretted Hanák coach Leoš Kalvoda.
Opava also took the point due to absences from the line-up, where petr Vavřík and three-goal shooter Petr Ševčík, who are guests from Sigma in Silesia, were also missing in addition to the two injured.
Unlike its previous policy, it did not allow them to take up employment.
Surrogates deserve discharge.
Sigma looked more footballing, but except for one standard, we didn't let her do anything," said Silesian coach Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and militancy.
A draw is probably well deserved, a point is a decent gain for us," he added.
Sigma took a four-point lead in the tie, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy club boss Josef Lébr, who, after his defeat to Znojmo, made his million-dollar contribution to the coffers subject to diametrically opposed performances in the following matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébra's warning, so there can be no talk of boys not wanting to fight," Kalvoda quimed, adding to the sleeping shooter Vasicke: "I believe it will come, and when he scores, it will start to fall.
But after the first shot, I'll immediately relieve him to save his goals for the next few games," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has twice been a source of great concern for Venice.
Film festival otherwise experiencing crisis
After the huge excitement over the inaugural film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iñárritu suddenly became one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the following days suggested that interest in the 71st venice festival had declined somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed but less appealing films for viewers, such as the 1960s documentary about genocide in Indonesia, The View of Silence and other social-themed films from America's 99 homes to Iran's Tales, there were simply empty seats left empty seats in cinemas.
Comic book heroes
Even the red carpet outside the festival palace had not yet been as crowded as in the past, and it was reportedly no longer a problem to get a last-minute seat at the hotel.
The crisis is being talked about more in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has affected such esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the world's oldest film festival.
Fortunately, the crisis does not manifest itself in a lack of personalities, but present exclusively in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who have successfully performed dramatic roles in 99 homes, the visit of legendary actor Al Pacino has in no way become a major event for all generations.
He also starred in two films.
In The Out-of-Competition Provider, based on philip roth's novel, 74-year-old Pacino has a role close to his name: an actor at the height of his fame who suffers from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as a weirdo hardware store owner from a country town in the film Manglehorn, made by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's Trophy for Best Actor should not miss him - but does an artist of Pacino's format still need awards?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, especially the Italian one, for although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly claims the country from which his grandparents come.
Points for Italians
After all, Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The black souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became birdman's first picture rewarded with a long standing ovation.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is viewed by looking at family relationships between clans fighting each other for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: quality script, camera, music and actors.
He also attracted the attention of the chamber psychothriller Hungry Hearts, who filmed Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost kills her own child with her misguided anxiety.
On the contrary, french competition films did not receive a warm reception, neither Ransom for Fame nor 3 Hearts, both works adhering to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really excellent films, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so little for the first half of the festival.
And while festival films have depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich's new film, She's Funny That Way, a witty comedy set out of competition in Venice and shot in the style of 1940s American hilarious, managed to lift the spirits for more than a day.
Police caught four meth producers in Prague, transporting drugs from Poland
"Detectives have arrested three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman who manufactured and sold the drug meth in Prague 9 between last November and August this year," police spokeswoman Jana Rösslerová said.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, a task force in Brick Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was part of the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a benefit saleser.
The next day, detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, with prior approval from the state's attorney.
The last of the four policemen was apprehended in the area of the Malešice incineration plant in the early hours of Wednesday morning, August 20," the spokeswoman said.
A woman received a third of the drug for transporting drugs from Poland
The main organizer had a wide field of work.
In the workshop of the Leten area, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Koněvova Street and other places in Prague 9, he produced meth, provided various aids and chemicals needed for its production and provided the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags and subsequently sold meth.
A 25-year-old woman, who had not yet been punished, helped him transport drugs from Poland or sell them to addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler added.
Criminologists also conducted several house searches at the judge's bestraining order, securing drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, tubes and other aids and items that experts believe can be considered complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the police then found that the main organizer had been prosecuted seven times for property crimes since 1995, the woman was not a judge," the police spokeswoman added.
The last detainee was given a suspended sentence in 2006 for the offence of sexual abuse, and the 37-year-old 37-year-old emote, who is being prosecuted, has been convicted nine times since 2009.
For him, too, it was mostly for property crime.
The investigator charged three men and a woman with the commission of a crime of illicit manufacture and other handling of nat drugs and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to 10 years in prison.
In the end, the investigator also filed a motion with the public prosecutor for custody, where the judge eventually placed them," the spokeswoman said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old repeat offender, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as fundamental as that of the other defendants.
The police are still working with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers very interesting things in its other products at very "interesting" prices.
Handmade chess with a board of 42 x 42 cm will serve as a good example in Italy.
If you like it, prepare more than 40,000 CZK.
The exact price is CZK 43,405.
The customer gets a set of wooden black and red painted figures stored in a wooden box covered with carbon fiber.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, instead of a classic rider, players have a figure of a bucking horse at their disposal.
If chess doesn't seem like a worthy gift, there's also a Ferrari 500 F2 model made (handmade, of course) in a 1:1.8 scale.
The price of this toy is CZK 318,305.
Abolishing grammar schools and high schools doesn't make sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that grammar school students have a good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been major preparations in schools in the last fortnight.
Most of the time, these are routine matters, such as transferring pots from the summer repository back to classes and shopping chalk.
They're going to be a little busy at the Hořický high school.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment, as well as literature for the library.
There has been no robbery or embezzl, the four-year grammar school in Hořice is opening and renewing its activities after three years.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the founders being so incompetent.
They had to wait to see if the existence of the school would be confirmed by the entry in the register of schools managed by the Ministry of Education, Education, Education and Training.
"The French Socialists should shut up and fix France," says Francois Hollande's key ally
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to "show its support" for a combative socialist president whose new division of office has not met with the approval of a majority of French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, applauding.
In a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not challenge France's controversial 35-hour workweek, despite heated speculation from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who proposed earlier this week that the rules be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the Socialists to remain "coherent" with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, the justice minister, crossed a line under his budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebel Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for "losing faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, leader of the extreme conservative right, scentented at the constant internal strife among the Socialists, saying she did not expect the new Valls government to last more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and So is Prince Manuel Valls. They were forced to form a new government when the previous one didn't last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for Parliament to be dissolved, saying that she believed the party could win early elections and that she was ready to run the country.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and in May the extreme conservative right succeeded in the European Parliament elections.
According to an opinion poll in the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before hollande's term in 2017 is over.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new Socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
"It's a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think there are changes in the situation," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague until the elections
Changes to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved only by the new management of the capital.
Other playhouses will not disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
Dog walking will not be restricted either.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve changes to the relevant decrees in the council before the October elections.
"Moreover, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current management of the city, which ends its mandate in a few weeks," said Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling across the board in recent weeks.
But the gambling rooms will not disappear, the gambling ordinance will not be changed yet.
It's the task of the new leadership of the city after the election.
Now we wouldn't even technically make it, given, for example, deadlines for comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current council, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on 11 September.
A referendum on the blanket ban on gambling is planned on the day of the municipal elections of the Prague 1 and Prague 8 districts.
Currently, there is a gambling ban in Prague 2 or Prague 12, for example.
For the same reasons, the decree will not be changed even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
This is particularly complained about by Prague 1, which has already sent a proposal to the municipality for places that it would like to extend the current list of banned places.
Prague 5 also does not want musicians around Anděl.
The decree regulating dog walking has been in the city for several months, it is not yet finalized.
The location of the gambling halls and the issue of busking are dealt with by city ordinances.
They can only be issued or edited by the capital city council.
Town halls have only an advisory voice, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he put victory at the fingertips of Scottish independence pros.
The Campaign for Scottish Independence was in danger of making this mistake a third time when it almost put the question of whether Scots wanted to be rich on billboards across Scotland.
But you can't reach the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets or respekting them when you start threatening them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots are far more inclined to drive money changers out of the temple than to have them dictate how they vote.
The Scottish Nationalists' leader, Alex Salmond, knows this well, which is why he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, in a televised debate whether he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence and start supporting the single currency for Both Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and he fell into this trap with a grimace.
Of course Darling won't support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
But the debate about what currency Scotland will have has been more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, jobs and defending the free national health service.
Darling backed London bankers on the currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of the health service.
By, as Salmond put it, he "went to bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with the Conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to voters in Scotland, but to the Association of "Bosses", to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron's refusal to discuss independence with Scottish First Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee landlord.
The Scots would respect him if he came to the debate with the Scottish First Minister.
At least Cameron could say that Scotland could be a "successful independent country."
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots should not jump up and accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
Pessimistic start to school according to Miloš Urban

Miloš Urban Longest Year
The end of the holidays was the best ever, the last week that went nowhere and we just hung out and hung out with grandma summer, the silence before the storm, the peace from the stress.
New clothes when you could get them from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading The Rapid Arrows, for the 50th time, the squealing of the mountain around the Imperial to the rear of Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun was stroking the back and shoulders, tapping the rays goodbye.
In the evening, slight nervousness, still holiday mode, sleep until 11:30, in a week it will be worse, the moments before falling asleep will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, then in the morning get up at 6:30.
Monday's coming up.
It doesn't usually rain, on the contrary, summer is viably sneered at in front of the school.
To come to the ground in ghostly light and feel like a plastic figure in a glass paper wasp, there's this school, elementary school, A.D.A.
Zapotocký with monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new, boys pulled out, girls bustier.
There are thugs over there, avoiding them, it's still interesting how infallibly they stick together and how early they are here.
And these grown-up-up girls who came screaming are laughing hysterically now, something's probably changed in their lives over the holidays, whereas for me everything's the same.
And new freshmen, some nervous and others excited, why are they even coming here?
Because they have to, educational military obliged.
So inside, the cold humidity of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the poisoned janitor with the mop, unfortunately still the same one who supposedly lends the pupil the key to the tin box, where textbooks can be left and of which there are still so few.
For a bottle.
The smell of the changing rooms remains in memory, now it's not happening, it's pretty aired out, but it's going to get worse in a week.
The thought of it just is a stomach ache and a headache.
A head that's even harder to hold in math, that evil game for the chosen ones, which I'm not one of, and I never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, god forbid fives, hide from rehearsals, fit in the pew and best be there, be there and not be there, exist only as a name in the classroom, and dream of stories of nicer girls and nicer buildings, antennas in space where no one competes with anyone, humiliates anyone and doesn't break anyone's leg.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only day one, now it's like years ago.
She let her daughters die.
She faces an exceptional sentence - Novinky.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the cubicle of public toilets at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without anyone's help, a little girl was born, which she wrapped in a prepared blanket after cutting the pumping, hid under her jacket and carried to the roadside, where she was dumped in bushes a few dozen meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school.
It came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I felt the need to go to the bathroom, where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors that I wore to school," the defendant described, saying she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to the scene, put the child's body in a backpack and took it away, removed the body from her backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid and left it under the staircase at her grandmother's house in Havlíčkova Brod," the lawsuit states, noting that it is not entirely clear when the newborn's death occurred.
It could have been in tens of minutes, but also a few hours after giving birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or when inserted under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding out of an untied pug.
A similar scenario was repeated the following spring.
The woman gave birth by herself in secret between February and April 12, when the child's body was found by random witnesses under a bush by a pond in Havlíčkobrodsk.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family house.
Without checking whether she was born alive without cutting and tying the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic wrappers, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his then partner took him to the pond.
Finally, a friend turned her in.
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who reportedly did not know about his partner's pregnancies.
For this reason too, he is not standing trial now, only he has been punished for an offence against the Funeral Home Act.
It was he, too, who later contacted the police.
I don't like that he's not being punished as an complicit.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it felt human at the time," said the defendant, who was allegedly subjected to and feared in a relationship with a man.
During her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly serenely.
Tears came to her eyes only when she spoke of her relationship with her parents, from whom she herself had left after reaching the age of age.
She said she didn't want to kill.
"They come to visit me every fortnight, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she sobbed.
I didn't get gear because I didn't want kids, I felt young.
I kept going to put it in the babybox, but I don't know what happened when I didn't.
I can't explain that to you," she replied to the judge's question.
However, she refused to act with the intention and intention of killing the newborn.
Moreover, she claimed, the second child was stillborn.
Even during her pregnancy, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I've limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I've also restricted smoking," she said.
Although the pregnancy was visible in both cases, she told everyone, even repeated questions, that she had health problems, that she was watered.
And so is my friend.
The trial will continue at the Hradec Králové court on Tuesday with the testimony of expert witnesses.
A verdict could be handed down by Wednesday.
The woman is at risk of a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, possibly an exceptional sentence.

Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of North American passenger volume, according to initial tender registration.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities the day after vote decision
Nearby stood a group of people loyal to Beijing waving a Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates take part in the 2017 hong kong elections.
All candidates must first win the support of the naming committee, which is likely to consist of members loyal to Beijing.
The decision made it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballot and get pro-democratic activists to renew their vows and cripple Hong Kong's financial center with protests by the "Occupy Central" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is a major cause of tension, with Chinese leaders fearing that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report in June outsming China's official authority in Hong Kong, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special district, and hundreds of thousands marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, which will be held by Premier Li, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Zhang Ronghsun, Vice-President of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, and Feng Wei, Deputy Director of the State Council of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, were also to speak at several press conferences during the day.
Cold activists said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government office this afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain had never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start negotiations with eastern Ukraine on 'state sovereignty'
According to a description of the events by a Russian newspaper, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked the Ukrainian government to halt fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "state sovereignty" of the secessionist areas.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin's remark did not intend to indicate that areas of eastern Ukraine under separatist control would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reconsidered so that the Russian-speaking region would be given the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian rebels as equals is consistent with the apparent strategy under which it has governed since the unrest began five months ago: Help the separatists secesce territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant de facto independence to the newly proclaimed Novorusk so that it can unite with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the first state television channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to re-re-enter the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seaded by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently designated the recently occupied territory as "Novorusko" or "New Russia," a term that refers to the glory days of the Russian Empire.
Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported Putin's words that "prisoner illusions" are anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon, as Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns ahead of parliamentary elections on October 26, while government troops attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately enter into meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and on the status of state sovereignty in southeast Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said Putin's allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under discussion with Kiev's leadership for months, to alleviate russian-speaking concerns about threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to eastern regions.
This is not a matter to discuss between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman's move to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored russia's leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist insurgency in the east, which is different from the open seizure of Crimea, where most of the two million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would also have much more difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of ukraine's 6.5 million people are not Russians, and opinion polls conducted before the conflict have shown broad support for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, effectively giving the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland to Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula annexed five months ago is home to Russia's main naval fleet, maritime trading facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Rostov and Crimea in Russia are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
During his inaugural address on June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections - consider changes to the constitution that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy is very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatists. Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to treat the separatists as equals followed the rebels' advance last week after Russian troops and tanks from a previously quiet area along the Sea of Azov entered eastern Ukraine.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear it is a campaign to capture strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This hastened a huge civil and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combined population of 500,000 that lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday, voing action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support besieged separatists.
The first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaysk in the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured in the interior of Ukraine a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also implicated in the revealed photos scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who allegedly stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence went viral in the biggest celebrity photo-hacking scandal.
Hacker claims to have 60 photos with the out-of-the-way Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko have also reportedly gone public due to the iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grecko last month, told Confidential magazine, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It's a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Grecko, who is now in New York, told an online newspaper, according to reporters, that the hack was "blatant" and that those who had been targeted "feel humiliated."
The hacker is thought to have obtained 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two topless pictures of her lying around the pool.
Palmer appeared in the film Love and Honor, where Liam Hemsworth was her counterpart.
Palmer, tv series star Chuck Strahovski and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen images yesterday.
A representative for Lawrence told TMZ, "This is a clear violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his Twitter feed: "Posting photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
Legally, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma's players made up with Lébra, even without a win
Olomouc - The thunder and lightning that josef Lébr, the co-owner of Olomouc Sigma, sent to his subordinates last week, seems to be a thing of the past.
Even though they only got a point from Opava for a goalless draw.
By their commitment and combativeness, they made up a little bit for the club boss.
The money for the paychecks could soon come to the club.
"I'll keep one more game, like I said last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lébr said, confirming that despite Sigma's not winning, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The combativeness and commitment we played mainly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive you for not won.
If we had played like that from the beginning of the season, I'm convinced we hadn't lost yet," says Lébr.
Sigma endured the home side's initial pressure in Opava, then levelled the game and was better in the second half.
After the victory, Kalvoda's charges reached, but they did not reach for the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not what we want.
To our complete satisfaction, however, we were only one chance changed," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in attitude of the footballers was caused only by his threat.
There were definitely more aspects.
Whether on my part, on the coach's side or on the fans' side," Lébr said.
Sigma has to take the pressure into account
The players did not want to comment much after last week's game in Opava.
I'm trying to put these things away.
I tried not to admit it," said michal Reichl, a young goalkeeper.
Without comment, the striker Václav Vasicek left a question about Lébr's statement last week, which did not convert Sigma's greatest opportunity in Saturday's match.
Eventually, however, he talked a little about the pressure.
We'll always be under pressure.
Everybody wants to take it out on us.
Today we showed that if we fight and ride all the asses, we can," he said.
They took the warnings to heart
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not pretend that preparing for the match was not the easiest, given the atmosphere in Olomouc last week.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized that, and today you could see that they had taken Mr. Lébro's warning to heart.
Even before that, it wasn't about them not wanting to fight and sloppy," said the Olomouc coach.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a while to come to terms with the toughness and realize what League Two was all about.
That it's not just about football, it's about fighting," Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next few matches Sigma will be able to do it from the beginning.
"I would love to believe that," he added.
