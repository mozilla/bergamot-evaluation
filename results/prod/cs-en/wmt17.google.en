The 28-year-old chef is found dead in a shop in San Francisco
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was on the steps of a local store this week.
But the victim&#39;s brother says he has no idea who would want to hurt him, adding: &quot;He has finally started to prosper.&quot;
The body, found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning, was identified as Frank Galicia, a 28-year-old San Francisco resident.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
The victim&#39;s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, a former ordinary chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons &amp; Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons &amp; Daughters said they were &quot;shocked and destroyed&quot; by his death.
&quot;We have a small team that works as a close-knit family. We will miss you very much, &quot;said the spokesman.
In these difficult times, our thoughts and grief belong to Frank&#39;s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in hostels, but that recently &quot;he has finally started to prosper.&quot;
&quot;He found an apartment, dated a girl,&quot; Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food and made us dinner, &quot;said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any quarrels.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
&quot;Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day,&quot; he said.

Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, the state carrier has invested over 31 billion crowns in the modernization of vehicles.
One third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernization in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually declining.
In the last six years, Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion crowns in vehicle modernization.
One third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in a reduction in average age by two years for locomotives and stand-alone units and by six years for conventional wagons.
The carrier gave a larger share of investments to regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money went, and 40 percent of the company invested in the renewal of long-distance vehicles.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, modernized older vehicles are included in this indicator as completely new.
If vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of ČD&#39;s traction vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age of 23 years when upgrades are taken into account.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic sets consisting of wagons and towed by a locomotive have gradually disappeared from Czech and global railways in recent years and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotives decreased from 280 to 223, and the number of classic wagons dropped from 2,716 in 2011 to 2,132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier disposed of mainly old vehicles equipped with leatherette seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening while driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
Among the investments that ČD plans to make in the vehicle fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework agreement for the purchase of electrical units for domestic expressway.
The contract provides for the purchase of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electrical units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can&#39;t get rid of it.
We are completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editors of the online daily Aktuálně.cz have been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where not only a tourist walk in the treetops is interesting, but also the Olympic Park.
Highway administrators know they&#39;re standing there illegally, but they say they can&#39;t do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of similar ads across the country.
According to officials, the weak law is to blame, due to which it is not possible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
A complex bureaucratic wheel is needed first.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the office is short of it.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process must begin again.
A quarter of a year ago, the Directorate of Roads and Motorways admitted: on the main route from České Budějovice to Lipno, an advertising billboard stands illegally on our land by the state road.
But even three months was not enough for officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable construction with a giant advertising poster.
As if no one minded that he was standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter protection zone, where nothing could stand for safety reasons.
Road administrators claim that they cannot simply deal with a billboard due to a leaky law.
Need to load it and take it away.
&quot;We can&#39;t just afford that,&quot; said Nina Ledvinová, a spokeswoman for the Roads and Motorways Directorate, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must precede by law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which began to follow the online daily Aktuálně.cz in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot solve efficiently and quickly.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editors counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules right next to the road or near it.
Other regions are in a similar situation.
&quot;We have difficulties in forcing the company to remove the banners,&quot; confirms Jiří Klása, head of the transport department of the České Budějovice regional office, whose colleagues solve similar stories.
According to Klása, the leaky law, which binds officials, is to blame.
First, he has a hard time reaching out to the billboard owner to put the ad away.
However, the heads of companies are often unbeatable or they know the trick that Aktuálně.cz has described in the past, when it became more interested in the issue: just move the mobile stand with advertising a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove black advertising in the trash.
This is because the office must determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
&quot;If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly do not agree, it is seen as a new device and we have to contact the owner again,&quot; explains Jiří Klása.
The new law will not help.
The change could have been brought about by a new law, which will ban billboards on motorways from September next year and restrict them on 1st class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily portable ads will remain the same.
And the authorities will not be relieved.
Companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year in renting illegal areas, and no one can afford them.
For example, a billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the České Budějovice municipality is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with her for illegally placed billboards.
The company faces a fine of 300,000 in each case.
These are more advertisements that were placed in the protection zone of the 1st class road without permission.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the České Budějovice municipality.
The advertisement that Aktuálně.cz is interested in does not yet figure among these cases, but it will most likely be added to them soon.
According to ŘSD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinová, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will thus reach the table of regional and then probably municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of the suspicious companies that fails to contact.
It does not take over the post office and abolished its official headquarters in Žižkov more than six years ago.
It is not even clear who is behind it.
In the past, the company&#39;s post office went to the South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
However, Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard leases areas from Comerz Billboard and offers them to advertisers, has in the past rejected any connection.
At the same time, this spring, when ŘSD became interested in advertising on Lipno at the initiative of Aktuálně.cz, Fischer had state officials send a letter for the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his boarding house, where the company is said to be based.
Even from this address, however, no one has contacted the motorway administrators to this day.
A futile fight.
Similar silences or opaque changes of residence are not uncommon.
We gradually fined one company two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed her name and ID number and there was nothing to solve.
The executor returned the case, the ads kept going, maybe elsewhere.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It&#39;s like fighting windmills, one of the officials admits on condition of anonymity.
No one is solving the amendment to the law in this regard yet.
Aktuálně.cz spoke with several deputies who were interested in the problem.
But they have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, deputies appeared who wanted to extend the deadline for maintaining billboards on the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic not only for national but also for regional and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand, they need them themselves for advertising in election campaigns.
I do not hold the relatively established impression that if something does not work, then it is necessary to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, statistics estimate.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Nevertheless, this year&#39;s harvest exceeds the average for the last five or ten years.
On the other hand, the harvest of rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
The cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This follows from an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of 15 July.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and assumed a tenth decline compared to last year.
But last year&#39;s cereal harvest was above average.
This year&#39;s harvest exceeds the average for the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the rapeseed and poppy harvest will be higher this year.
Rapeseed growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year&#39;s poppy harvest could be 2.5 percent higher than last year.
The expected decline in cereal production is due to both a decrease in yield per hectare by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tons per hectare and a decrease in sown area.
Farmers have sown three percent fewer fields this year.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czechia, is estimated to be harvested 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers planted it in more fields.
However, the decline will be reflected in a lower yield per hectare, which will fall to 6.04 tons.
The statistics predict a roughly one-fifth decrease in spring barley, which is most often used for beer production.
The reduction in yield is due to a reduction in sown areas by 15.2 percent, but also a lower yield per hectare.
Winter barley, on the other hand, is produced 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of rye will also increase.
The statistics estimate the rapeseed harvest at 1.305 million tons, which is more than last year.
The sown areas expanded by 7.3 percent.
However, the yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year&#39;s rapeseed crop will exceed the ten-year average by 13.3 percent, while sown in the area is a third larger than ten years ago.
Poppy fields have also been growing in the last four years.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when poppies were grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, the fields are half.
Thanks to the expansion of sown areas, this year&#39;s poppy harvest will be richer.
It will increase by 2.5 percent compared to last year to 27,423 tons.
However, the yield per hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police accused two men of assault with a knife and a machete, and the court sent them into custody.
Police accused two assailants who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete on Tuesday in the center of Olomouc.
&quot;Although the victim tried to escape, they caused him a cutting and cutting injury, which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment,&quot; said police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková.
Both apparent perpetrators were apprehended by police immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a motion with the court to take them into custody, and the court granted him on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police accused two detainees of attacking a 35-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The attackers inflicted cuts and cuts on him, and the man ended up in hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which happened on Tuesday at noon on Svobody Avenue, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, informed Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková.
A mass clash between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal argument, two assailants attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, they caused him a cutting and cutting injury, which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment, said a police spokeswoman.
The skirmish, which attracted a lot of attention in the city center and caused several police patrols and police officers to intervene on the spot, involved family disputes.
Criminalists accused a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc of attempting grievous bodily harm and rioting.
The plaintiff filed a motion with the court to take them into custody and the court granted him on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The machete was also used by attackers in the center of Olomouc during a mass battle five years ago, when it happened only a few tens of meters away, in front of the Varna disco in Riegrova Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the company, who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You will be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most glaring examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážné náměstí.
It was supposed to function as a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That it is necessary to build new and new flats and offices in the metropolis?
And what about the use of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several apartment buildings which, despite their location, size and often even monument protection, are just deserted and empty.
We selected the properties in the center with the help of the Emptydomy.cz project, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relations between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Whether the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

The Clinton earned $ 10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to disclose his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $ 10.6 million last year.
They donated more than a million dollars to Clinton for charity.
Most of Clinton&#39;s income - over six million dollars - is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
U.S. Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $ 10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of Clinton&#39;s revenue - over six million dollars - is for their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that Mr and Mrs Clinton paid 34.2 percent federal income tax last year, as well as nine percent state and local income tax.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar step, he has not yet decided to publish a tax return.
There is a possibility that Donald Trump does not pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after publishing her confession.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to the secrets surrounding Trump&#39;s income, among other things to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims, the AP agency said.
Trump&#39;s fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican candidate&#39;s reputation as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with his former first lady, today released a report on his tax payments over the past decade.
Together with his wife Anne Holton, they donated 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and paid 25.6 percent of their earnings last year.
Polio has erupted again in Nigeria.
Islamists from Boko Haram opposed thorough vaccinations and killed doctors.
Polio cases have reappeared in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccination, as two children infected with the disease are paralyzed.
Vaccines transported helicopters there.
Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram worked in the affected area, defending the vaccinations and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated there unnoticed.
Emergency vaccination of children against polio will begin in northeastern Nigeria, as two children infected with the disease have been paralyzed there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are operating, according to the AP agency.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating unnoticed in the area for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have defended vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where children with polio were found on Thursday.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from a part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
Michel Zaffran, director of the WHO polio eradication section, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria would begin next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in the state of Borno.
The area was not made available to international organizations and the government until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram was significantly weakened in this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that new cases of polio are a great disappointment to the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio had been eradicated.
The WHO pointed out that it is possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it still spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases in the world.
While polio was still present in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the moving stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met twenty former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to the police.
The pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
With this meeting, František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensification of the fight against it.
Pope Francis met in Rome with twenty former prostitutes who were released by the police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the turbulent stories of fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes František visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one each from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
According to the Vatican, they were all subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
By visiting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intensification of the fight against him, said the pope&#39;s spokesman.
František often draws attention to the fates of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican in April and June this year thanks to his personal invitation.
France will strike on the production of jihadists.
But it will not be possible without the help of Muslims.
France is to be helped by Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Vall is preparing major changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer houses.
And more will follow, the interior minister announced.
There are over a hundred jihadist factories in the country.
&quot;If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this religion freedom,&quot; said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams educated in France preach in mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad to build new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is one of the reasons why preachers who can spread radicalism in France enter mosques.
&quot;Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy,&quot; the prime minister added.
The key to ensure that these goals are met will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The country now has a French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, the foundation was to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But institutions were soon hit by internal strife and rivalry.
&quot;It&#39;s a total failure,&quot; Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate broke out over a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
Everything was hastened by further terrorist attacks in France, carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently said that a new foundation would be set up in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to secure funding for mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where he will get the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One is a special fee or tax on halal food.
In practice, halal food vendors would pay for certification.
Part of this money would then go to the foundation&#39;s coffers.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who set out for Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 go on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should work in mosques.
This should ensure that the sermon is in line with democracy.
We will close radical mosques.
The French government is currently campaigning against the radicals.
And more will follow, the interior minister announced recently.
In France, there is no place for those who proclaim hatred in mosques and do not respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have deported about 80 imams and are considering several dozen more.
But not everyone thinks that the government&#39;s actions can significantly counteract radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not the case in mosques, young people are radicalizing themselves on the Internet, said Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Center for Scientific Research.
Tracker Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint to star Baugém.
To advance to the round of 16, the Czech track cyclist must fight in repair runs.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen lost the battle with French giant Grégory Baugé, a defender of silver from previous games in London, in the first round at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after advancing from the sprint qualification among the top eighteen.
He must fight for advances to the round of 16 in the corrective races.
27 riders stood at the start of the royal discipline on the track and the best Czech tracker of today set the fourteenth best time.
He caught the two-man with a flying start in 9.969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, the fifth Baugé was waiting for him in the qualification, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
In the end, Kelemen was reaching for an experienced Frenchman, but he was watching the progress.
Gold defender Jason Kenny shone with a great performance.
The 28-year-old Briton set the third fastest two hundred in history and won the qualification in the Olympic record of 9,551.
As expected, he also easily coped with the last advancer, the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful in the line-up with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3: 50.570 in the 4 km race and advanced to the finals.
They improved the previous maximum (3: 51,659), which belonged to the British four years after the Olympics in London, by more than a second.
Young doctors pushing: They want a fresh breeze in the field
Representatives of the young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association&#39;s (BMA) Council of Young Physicians (JDCs) must ask the full council to support further sectoral events in early September.
The JDC says ministers have failed to resolve the agreement.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained &quot;silent&quot; on the issues, which helped to reject the contract.
She said: &quot;In this light, the JDC executive voted to reject the proposed new treaty altogether and request new formal negotiations on all issues.&quot;
In response to the government&#39;s silence, the JDC&#39;s executive board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA to approve the ongoing program of focused industry events in early September.
The dispute led young doctors to declare six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The leader of young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members at pre-vote meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the treaty would be a burden for medics in England.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of the &quot;Incompatible&quot;?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
Russia and Turkey leaders met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of an eight-month verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart into the luxurious hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted to long for this reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not smile, and barely radiated warmth, even to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his &quot;dear friend&quot; Mr. Putin - five times, according to one report.
I didn&#39;t count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to pre-crisis levels, but would be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper wrote that Erdogan had acted as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the lingering cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory speech: the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow&#39;s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin dealt blows around him and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The outrage was all the greater because it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, the state-controlled media led a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame.
More serious have been allegations from top state officials that Erdogan&#39;s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting came about only because Putin received the apology he had asked of President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory as well.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during the failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have visibly also shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a severe impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights that transport several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies are sure to take a break here if flights resume.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when the import of agricultural commodities from Turkey was allowed again.
&quot;Tourists there, tomatoes back here,&quot; as a report in the Vedemosti newspaper reported.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
In addition, long-standing hostility protracted talks on EU accession and Putin&#39;s entry - who are eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey&#39;s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly gained bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that this is a given for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to show what one of the analysts described to me as an &quot;alliance of the incompatible&quot;: how the forces unite two countries that feel rejected and used by the West.
However, despite publicly showing mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took on the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of introductory talks, the two presidents stated at a press conference that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question of the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two states can find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland
According to the bank&#39;s executive director, the RBS brand is to be suppressed into the role of back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank&#39;s global ambitions.
It eased when they almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategic brands used &quot;RBS&quot; to protect other consumer finance brands.
It cost millions of pounds to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations Rugby Championship to Winbledom Champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to make national brands stand out more.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that come to the fore - Coutts, Adam &amp; Co, Drummond, and Holt&#39;s Military Bank.
During trips to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan&#39;s questions.
He told BBC Scotland: &quot;The RBS brand will no longer be our investor brand and the brand our employees work for, as we are now becoming much more of a brand bank.&quot;
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in its own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, it has prepared a profile of individual brands of sports sponsorship.
&quot;The time has come for us to move towards a brand bank, because the basic question (which we ask ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?&quot; Said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would become a great bank for customers and introduce those brands.
But as we focus on customer needs rather than our own, I think there are a lot of changes going on.
We can recall these marks again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori led the 3000th winner to the finish line in Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory at Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in Britain at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - the Predilection horse, coached by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in flat races.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion, Dettori, who had previously won Ghayyar, said: &quot;It&#39;s weird.&quot;
I am very moved because my family is here too
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because that is where I landed 30 years ago.
It&#39;s not a great event, it&#39;s not Royal Ascot - it&#39;s Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I was relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations as he brings Predilection after the victory
Two jockeys have reached this milestone in obstacle races - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has reached more than 4,300 winners during his record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical string that distinguishes him from other riders in the weighbridge.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn&#39;t just ridden on weekends and big races, he would have had 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie has ridden the winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that&#39;s really something.
It has a lively nature, which is good for British racing. But more importantly, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump
From flying finishes to flying jumps - Frankie Dettori has been a messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
Inexhaustible numbers of winners of major races, including his famous &quot;magnificent seventh&quot; in Ascot. But he also survived a plane crash and was banned from taking off due to drugs.
He stagnated for the first time three years ago when he returned after a 6-month start ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and returned to his best form despite all the skeptics.
And maybe it won&#39;t be the last time - Dettori has said before that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin has fired the head of the presidency, Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidency on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin&#39;s closest associates for many years.
Ivanov, 63, has been appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin &quot;released Ivanovo from his service as head of the Russian presidency,&quot; but no reason was given.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivan&#39;s deputy since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno used to be a diplomat.
He was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later worked as head of the presidential protocol and presidential office.
Speaking to Putin, he said, &quot;Thank you for your trust.&quot;
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vajno replace him.
Will smiles convince?
This step completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin&#39;s closest associates and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidency, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, the two men said they were leaving the post of head of the presidency at their own request.
But the smiles in the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the result of a power struggle?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official claim that a man who had once been thought of as a possible president suddenly longed to lead Russia&#39;s environmental policy met with great distrust.
The Kremlin website quotes notes to Putin, in which Ivanov states: &quot;It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very demanding post, you could even say a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was the head of the presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
There was even speculation at one time that Ivanov could succeed Putin as head of state after his second term, because a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
However, this post was taken over by another of Putin&#39;s close associates, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later before returning to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, star of the series Thoughts of a Criminal, was released after hitting the director
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange on stage in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday for announcing his dismissal.
There were creative differences on the stage and disagreements.
I am sorry that this happened, &quot;he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS, details of how Gibson&#39;s character disappears from a series that follows the stories of an FBI team are a little later.
The 54 - year - old actor, best known for starring in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has appeared in the series since the first series in 2005.
&quot;I love the Thoughts of the Criminal, and for the last twelve years I have put my heart and soul into them,&quot; Gibson said in a statement issued Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end. But that will not be possible now.
I would also like to express my thanks to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The series is expected to return to the twelfth series on September 28.
Fish mysteriously landed in a garden in Banff
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish may be sand eels left behind by a tornado.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film of his discovery on the Periscope Canal, believing that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
The £ 1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern plateau and the Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the &quot;platform fans&quot; that are now almost complete around each of the bridge&#39;s three pylons.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 suspension ropes.
The £ 1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: &quot;This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnessing how civil engineers, on a truly impressive scale, used more than 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required exceptional precision.
A total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge is now in place, concrete for the last parts of the platform is now poured in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project manager, said: “The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the pinnacle of building construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the expanding North Tower platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and it was necessary to pull it with a gradient of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Moelfre Bay Rescue: Three Men Are &quot;Happy to Be Alive&quot;
The three men are &quot;happy to be alive&quot; after being washed away by water from their fishing boat off Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station sounded the alarm on Friday at 1:20 p.m. British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety as their boat continued uncontrollably.
&quot;We saw their boat circling near them and we had the worst of it,&quot; said Moelfre lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones.
&quot;Fortunately, a strong wind blew him away from them before we left,&quot; he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a life jacket exhausted holding on to buoys.
They were all transferred aboard a coastal lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station
Jones said: &quot;The three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely unharmed.
The ship&#39;s engine had an emergency stop rope, but somehow it was disconnected from the person driving the boat when it overturned.
Someone from above the boys was holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of Tluchoř&#39;s wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three deputies who, according to the indictment, were to receive political news from Prime Minister Nečas and his then head of the cabinet, Jana Nagyová, ie a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Schneider, Fuksa and Tluchoř enabled him with their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
That is why they also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, unjustifiably, and thus received a total of almost 2 million crowns in compensation.
Tluchoř now acts as a witness in the case, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in the courthouse at the Fruit Market and resolves civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be careful (dealing with criminal matters - editor&#39;s note) and avoid possible objections.
The case will probably be taken over by another Prague judicial district.
At the same time, the Queen has twice acquitted Jana Nečasová, formerly Nagyová,.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
In this case, Tluchoř did not figure.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I do not think that impartiality can be interpreted in such a way that a court is excluded if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I&#39;m afraid nothing could be judged then, he noted for the diary.
&quot;I find it sad,&quot; he added.
Roman Boček, a former official, is also accused in the case of political newsagents.
According to his lawyer Petr Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 heard the indictment of the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nečas, Jana Nagyová (now Nečasová), and other defendants in the case of misuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nečasová and her husband come to court.
Tluchořová was supposed to deal with statements about Peroutek.
For example, the exhibitor&#39;s wife was to judge President Miloš Zeman&#39;s statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutek.
Zeman said of him that he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by Allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two girlfriends of the same age from London Gatwick Airport last February.
The British Home Office has not commented on her death report.
Young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border, according to police.
According to the media, Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana went to see their other former classmate from the London school Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year provoked a huge wave of attention and also tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security forces estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
The work of dreams for a hundred thousand salary.
Great paid work that you don&#39;t even need college for.
This is how the work of the ajťák looks at first sight.
And often to the other.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech conditions (in Prague you earn up to CZK 180,000 by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is the huge shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, there are almost 20,000 IT specialists in the Czech Republic.
According to statistics from the Grafton personnel agency, the most sought-after are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Thus, candidates will not compete for a job position, but job positions for candidates, comments Jitka Součková, marketing manager of Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for Ajťák students.
Higher education provides a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate&#39;s intelligence and educability, but it often has little to do with knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which a university once graduated will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
He earns the most in Prague.
The wages of the Ajťák people are well above the national average everywhere.
The most money will come from Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hit parade.
&quot;Wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague,&quot; confirms Kubačka.
Technical directors will achieve the highest earnings.
In Prague and Brno they can cost 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it does not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
Upon boarding, they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
There is also a struggle for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this is not the case for students.
If companies pull over and overpay for an expert from another company, they are happy to reach for a graduate.
They can raise him to their liking.
They can&#39;t do without a tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but at least a decent English is necessary for Ajťák students.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker speaks more foreign languages, he is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds director Kubačka.
Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like Google aint for me either.
Czech employees can only quietly envy employees at Google.
Of course, they have flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various part-time jobs, not only for mothers.
&quot;The company gives new fathers an extra four weeks of vacation after the birth of a child,&quot; said Martina Joneková, a Google spokeswoman.
Pampering also includes health care for employees and family, meals, transportation, training, wellness or massages at the workplace.
Those who want to learn have a green light and it doesn&#39;t matter what they want to learn.
But that&#39;s not the end of the benefits.
Such a full refrigerator for free is definitely not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (breakfast and dinner in some locations) is available on site daily.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchens in all the offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the spokesman reveals.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, so what is not eaten is put in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible advantages in Czech terms?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
&quot;It&#39;s not important for Google that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions,&quot; the spokesman added.
The UN has sharply criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra&#39;ad al-Hussein, the UN commissioner for human rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government &quot;raises serious concerns about Bulgaria&#39;s failure to comply with international law,&quot; Zeid Ra&#39;ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He noted that &quot;it is particularly worrying to witness the importance of public and influential public figures in publicly supporting criminal armed militias who brazenly organize refugee hunts on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey.&quot;
&quot;One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who enter Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested,&quot; Zeid said.
What&#39;s worse, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized, despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, up from 21,000 last year.
Pokémon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It&#39;s fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the last decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people off the couch and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens originally shrank on television, later on video games and most recently on smartphones.
It&#39;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I&#39;m talking about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 90&#39;s (later there was a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest in the United States, Australia and New Zealand before the launch of this new game in early July.
Launches in other countries were then postponed due to strong interest, which led to server congestion.
Pokémon Go gained more users than Tinder in a few days, and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out looking for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can &quot;take a picture&quot; (via a screenshot on the phone) or &quot;catch&quot; them.
Mania has captivated a generation that played the game at a young age, lifting it from its seats and driving it out looking for Pokémon.
In the USA, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the &quot;average&quot; person takes every day.
Apple&#39;s 35,000-user Cardiogram app for smart watches recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people trained for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - they only see rough data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns to get people to &quot;find 30&quot;, &quot;get up from the couch&quot; and &quot;be active every day&quot; have fallen to barren ground because most public health messages are boring and aimed at people who don&#39;t look good.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity contributes to weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we cannot list here in full.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover the three pillars of health - exercise, fresh air and the sun&#39;s rays. And fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting for Pokémon.
As usual, there are, of course, those boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk in the door.
And what?
There was a breakthrough.
In their day, smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our activity, but they didn&#39;t give us a reason to do something like this game.
The news is revealed and interest in it begins to wane at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, more games will emerge that combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity and help many people hunt for activity, health, and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in the women&#39;s all-around gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to it all.
Dynamic on the jump.
Effortlessly on the balance beam.
When simple, everyone was speechless.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
The nineteen-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in all-around on Thursday and overtook the others at full speed under the Olympic spotlights.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over the silver medalist and member of the &quot;final five&quot; team Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a performance on the balance beam in the finals of the individual all-around in gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the all-around and the fifth overall, confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
Tears appeared on her face when her overall final score was on the board and her long journey to this point was over.
This success places her in the same league of unique athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold. Her stunning sets are a mixture of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her &quot;the best gymnast she has ever seen.&quot;
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the competitors, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything but returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be perceived as disappointing.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning a gold and silver medal in the women&#39;s women&#39;s all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was an exclamation mark in celebration of the outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she has never looked forward during her long journey to the top, which is not entirely true.
Part of her line-up in the simple - the one that contains her typical triple somersault with a double turn - is set in Latin music, which would just fit home, into the streets outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
That is not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and her talent was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman&#39;s mother on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and gained strength.
She hasn&#39;t lost the all-around competition since the summer of 2013 - it&#39;s a sequence of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafin took the lead for a short time thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
The balance beam and the simple - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back in the lead with 15,433 points for the balance beam - and finished with 15,933 points in the freestyle.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score — a mere formality — and tears appeared around the glittering red, white, and blue shadows as the wishes she had once written as a child had been fulfilled.
Raisman&#39;s performance was a bit of a revenge for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but then she won bronze due to the sum of the three best groups.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call &quot;Grandma,&quot; was far ahead.
After her voices, she sent airy kisses to the crowd, overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where she became a complete hit, has a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial killer shot dead while listening to music in a car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis&#39; daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked in the driveway.
The report states that an armed man stood on the passenger side and fired eight rounds with a handgun. Then he fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the robbery is not worth the triple murder because the attacker did not take the wallets or the amount of $ 2,900 that one of the adult victims had with them.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had anything to do with any of the previous four attacks.
A total of nine attacks were killed in two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods in four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
&quot;It&#39;s happening in a residential area in front of houses,&quot; Howard told CBS&#39;s KPHO branch earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to divulge what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis&#39; daughter Maleah died on the spot.
The witness told police that it was not uncommon for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, targeting an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder. Police believe that this serial killer was the perpetrator.
Investigators found cartridges and assembled a bullet from the remains of bullets in the seat and under the hood.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: &quot;His condition is improving&quot;
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, the first thing that occurred to me was that I couldn&#39;t do this.
I can&#39;t do this.
I&#39;m not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are ready for it, &quot;she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
&quot;My first reaction was that I thought people weren&#39;t doing this today,&quot; Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until the age of three, he could not sit or crawl. And he&#39;s still not talking.
However, it is slowly filling some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth demonstrates sign language, with which Edmund says &quot;please sing to me.&quot;
&quot;We teach him sign language,&quot; Picciut told CBS News.
But it&#39;s not ordinary sign language - he says that Edmund invented some characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciut is reminiscent of the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I keep asking, &quot;What&#39;s next?&quot;
What will be next?
And she&#39;s still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall forecast was, because I don&#39;t expect anyone to be able to tell me at all.
But Picciut has encouraging news for mothers of all children suffering from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your baby and your baby will love you.
Heavy rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and extensive flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rains are expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme rains, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are spilling out of their banks and threatening large-scale flooding.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor&#39;s office for national security and crisis preparedness, said they were receiving applications for water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa County alone had asked for ten thousand bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The meteorological service said in a statement that it could rain another 8 to 13 centimeters over the sea.
In South Alabama, a flood patrol was on alert on Friday as rains continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River at Baton Rouge and the Amite River at Denham Springs are forecast to peak at the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of houses in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He added that downstream flooding in Ascension County was a danger, with these flooded flows flowing slowly into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level as early as 9 a.m. local time on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking up people from torrential waters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were already rescued at Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other stepson, who lives nearby.
&quot;We woke up and the water was coming,&quot; Hansford said.
We had her up to my waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said crisis workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that as the heavy rains continued, the floods &quot;spread quickly&quot; and the authorities are considering an evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rain had fallen from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid roads required rescuing residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and canceling teaching in five school districts.
A WWL branch of CBS reported that 200 homes had been flooded, according to an elder from Tangipahoa.
Residents have been evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the high water.
Shelters have been set up in Amite and Hammond for evacuees.
&quot;They will be able to return home when the water begins to recede,&quot; he said.
More than 20 streets in the Tangipahoa district of Hammond were closed due to the floods, and locals were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
&quot;We had the last major floods here in March,&quot; said township manager Lacy Landrum.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, Crisis Manager at Harrison County, Mississippi, said the rain was continuing on the Gulf Coast.
He said a flood of houses was announced on Thursday, but none of them appeared on the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
&quot;I&#39;ve seen water in several places I&#39;ve never seen it before,&quot; Townson said, &quot;and it&#39;s still there.&quot;
Mahaj Brown (6) - &quot;a boy shot like a sieve&quot; survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot dead in Philadelphia. This week is the second shooting of a child aged 6 in the city.
The child&#39;s grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including the groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious during transport to the hospital.
&quot;He caught too much of it, his small body was covered like a net,&quot; his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I ca&#39;nt believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that the boy should recover.
He was to start the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three other men were shot dead: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, the other two victims are in stable condition.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle together with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there was probably a shootout between several armed men.
Cartridges from assault type weapons belonging to various assault weapons were found on the spot.
Apparently it was definitely an ongoing battle.
There were cartridges on both sides of the sidewalk on the street.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved, &quot;said Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi for the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been detained and police are reportedly investigating video footage from cameras.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday in front of a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine a women&#39;s gymnastics team for this year&#39;s Olympics, for several reasons.
First, I&#39;ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second: There are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren &quot;Laurie&quot; Hernandez, who have inspired so many young girls of color.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish descent, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
Finally we have a team that looks like America.
He also strengthened the presence of black women and Latin Americans at the forefront of the sport.
The number one gymnast for the past four years has been an African-American woman.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the champion of the Olympic Games and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in the women&#39;s women&#39;s all-around.
And team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing a sporting peak, but it does not look like that in gymnastics classes in the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie completed the same journey to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the &quot;final five&quot; because the team of gymnasts for the next Olympic Games will consist of only four female athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi trains.
The fact is, however, that gymnastics is a costly sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, equipment, trips, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their charges and families). ). And that&#39;s not all.
Most of these sports clubs are in affluent suburban areas that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for families of gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles&#39; coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez&#39;s coach, both coached the athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls that have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Hispanic) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that&#39;s great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It&#39;s a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simon, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing &quot;girl power&quot; and winning Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt&#39;s proposal, the young doctors are ready to go on further strikes
Ministers hoped to see an end to the revised agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) to end disagreements over the changes. But 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who voted rejected the contract.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to enforce the treaty, saying the NHS was in &quot;no man&#39;s land&quot; and further delays would have a detrimental effect on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures in order to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Commission for Young Physicians, said in a statement last night: &quot;Young physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labor crisis will increase and therefore all physicians will be treated fairly. &quot;
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors come under a new contract, progress is needed and time is running out.
The BMA&#39;s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with a reluctance to involve dr and often with deafening silence on the part of the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt&#39;s promise last month that the option is still open.
&quot;Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement and address the concerns of young doctors.&quot;
If this does not happen, then the young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed because nurses and specialists were called in to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
Ministers hoped to reach a disagreement on the changes following the conclusion of a revised agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA).
The BMA wants higher payments for weekend work for 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS&#39;s employers, called on young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: &quot;The industry action will do little or nothing, but will put pressure on already overburdened teams and services and increase anxiety, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families.&quot;
Over the past two months, we have met with a council of young doctors, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as workload, training flexibility, further training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and the gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health take the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
A medicine for sixty crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take a drug that costs around sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend administering it to more patients over a longer period of time.
The anti-clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a seizure recurrence in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizures.
The NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another stroke or heart attack.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is torn off, a blood clot may form, block the blood from entering the heart, and cause a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely to form.
The draft NICE directive, published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: &quot;Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack who suffer another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences.&quot;
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the patient&#39;s quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased to be able to expand the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from Ticagrelor&#39;s preliminary recommendation.
As information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - particularly on the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, treatment beyond this period is not recommended in the proposal.
With computer culture, fraud in Muslim areas began to flourish
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, linked to a government report
A culture of political correctness has led to the disregard of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said today.
Former Secretary of State Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticized police, election inspectors and City Hall for ignoring voter abuse for &quot;ethnicity and religion.&quot;
A former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said intimidation of voters based on their religion was so bad that police should make cordons in front of polling stations and protect frightened voters.
He recommended that voters take proof of identity with them and be able to prove who they are during the election.
At present, voters simply provide their name and address.
The report also proposes applying indelible ink to people&#39;s fingers when casting a vote to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for the press to be given greater access to meeting documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
&quot;This is not only about protection against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand,&quot; he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of an election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman &quot;cynically intervened&quot; the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
According to Rahman, &quot;he ran his campaign so that it was the religious duty of devout Muslims to vote for him.&quot;
As many as 300 votes have been challenged or as a result of identity theft, where a person votes and marries someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the correspondence vote fraud - which allegedly claimed that senior members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they had elected.
Sir Eric, pictured, made some recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presenting proof of identity
The report said: &quot;Evidence has been provided that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially in communities in Pakistan and Bangladesh.&quot;
&quot;Concerns have been raised that ... state institutions have turned a blind eye to such behavior due to &#39;politically correct&#39; hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.&quot;
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including forbidding political activists from manipulating correspondence votes to prevent &quot;vote extraction.&quot;
The report, which is currently being assessed by Theresa May, also calls for more rigorous registration checks to prevent the use of electoral rolls for immigration and benefit fraud.
Consider asking voters to provide proof of identity before voting.
Use indelible ink on people&#39;s fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Carrying out systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Limit requests for automatic correspondence voting to three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating cast correspondence and election envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around polling stations.
Amend laws to make it easier to prosecute people under illegal pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit taking photos in polling stations.
Require only English (except Wales) to work in polling stations.
Strengthen training to ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to the polls individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it is &quot;surprising&quot; that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
&quot;The election court has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices,&quot; he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of the evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the fruitless &quot;check box checks&quot; in the town hall voter registration departments.
Sir Eric said: &quot;Last year&#39;s court decision in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and covert spread of electoral fraud and the rejection of some institutions threaten this reputation.
The madness of the cycling double of Duchess Kate and other doubles of celebrities at the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games have gone crazy this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete seeking gold this year who can boast her own celebrity double - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities that are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL women&#39;s column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
Like hunted game: Brady Ellison (left), a member of the American archery team, has been compared to Leonard DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate&#39;s double on the bike path, many people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonard DiCaprio.
A racer from the American archery team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his images appeared, in which he strikingly resembles a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he had heard of his resemblance to Lee since he was a child.
&quot;He doesn&#39;t see much resemblance himself, except perhaps a beard,&quot; Brady told the Huffington Post.
&quot;He&#39;s a dude and he looks good, so I think that&#39;s a compliment.&quot;
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized even more this year: the striking resemblance between the British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin, with her large, expressive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been likened to Gell star Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan is an &quot;athletic version&quot; of the actor from the movie Inception.
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov boasts not only the same brown skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And fans say Nathan Adrian of the United States looks like an &quot;athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.&quot;
Capable women: football star Hope Solova (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eye shape
Not just one: The Twitter user was very pleased that the others noticed the similarities
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similar appearance of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction on the site that &quot;the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical.&quot;
Football star Hope Solo and actress of the Dexter series Jennifer Carpenter have a really incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, or gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who boasts a beautifully wide smile that seems to mimic the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of Bravo. , girls!
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying she &quot;exploded&quot; about Chinese swimmer
Viewers of Wednesday&#39;s live broadcast of the Olympic Games on CBC were outraged by the analysis of the performance of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women&#39;s 4x200 m freestyle relay race
The Canadian station CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that the fourteen-year-old Chinese swimmer &quot;stretched like a stench&quot; and &quot;exploded&quot; during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was muted when he began spewing his own opinions at the end of the women&#39;s 4x200m relay final.
MacDonald, who was to bring a &quot;revival&quot; to the CBC&#39;s team of commentators, said, among other things: &quot;The little fourteen-year-old from China gave up, you fool.&quot;
Too much excitement, it stretched like a stench, it exploded.
Thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race at 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to catch up with China.
Viewers in Canada quickly began to respond online and were horrified by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: &quot;The CBC announcer said that the fourteen-year-old swimmer from China&quot; exploded &quot;????&quot;
The idiot didn&#39;t notice he was still on the air. &quot;
Ai Yanhan from China in the finals of the women&#39;s 4x200 meter freestyle relay race was described as: &quot;The little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool.&quot;
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides, and many demanded his dismissal
When Twitter users found out how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn&#39;t hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: &#39;Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we&#39;re a bunch of racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald&#39;s live commentary and said, &quot;We apologize for the comment on the swimmer&#39;s performance that escaped the broadcast.&quot;
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we are sorry that it happened. &quot;
CBC eventually apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment
Co-commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
The CBC then copied and pasted their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald&#39;s comments
The station also quickly apologized and made a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, not to get on the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers and those who watch us on social media.
To be clear, Byron&#39;s comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized live and tried to explain his remark by saying he didn&#39;t want it to sound like a personal attack.
&quot;I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women&#39;s relay,&quot; he said in an Olympic broadcast on CBC.
&quot;I meant the performance of a swimmer and not the person of a swimmer as such.&quot;
&quot;Needless to say, I didn&#39;t mean to disrespect and I&#39;m very sorry.&quot;
Customers at Primark are outraged by a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman undressed to try on her panties in the sales area in the middle of Primark, shoppers weren&#39;t sure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to fit her size, took off her panties, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and finally tried on four pairs of panties in a store at Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Flokestone.
Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before putting them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a two-child mother who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman &quot;re-dressed and left the store without buying anything after trying on her underwear.&quot;
She said, &quot;People couldn&#39;t believe their eyes.&quot;
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own tights and panties, and put them on.
&quot;She didn&#39;t even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, cheeky like a monkey.&quot;
&quot;Everyone just stared as she took off her panties again, and she obviously didn&#39;t like it because she put it back on the shelf.&quot;
She did the same to three others before finally deciding she didn&#39;t like anything, getting dressed again and leaving.
&quot;She didn&#39;t seem to mind who was watching at all — not even to think of the man who might buy the panties she was trying on.&quot;
Miss Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and no one cleaned them. That&#39;s disgusting. &quot;
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added, &quot;When she left, I collected things that she was obviously trying to pull off the sale - which is also the only right thing to do.&quot;
&quot;I would be terrified to bring home new panties and find out that another woman was wearing them, taking them off and that they were not washed.&quot;
A spokesman for the Primark store said: &quot;Primark knows about the incident that took place at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th.&quot;
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend against a weapon attack using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but with this video from Dailymail.com, it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhon Mizrachi, Grandmaster of the Krav Magy Federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over the rapist, whether he approaches you from the front or from behind.
If he approaches you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you need to do is turn around to see your attacker and &quot;have a free trajectory.&quot;
You then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then a knee follows into the groin, and while the attacker writhes in pain, you twist the weapon out of his hand, hit him in the face with the main head, and begin to retreat, keeping the weapon aimed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it&#39;s a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab a weapon and twist it so the villain can&#39;t shoot.
At the same time, put strength in the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip and start to retreat, still aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of an ambush - unless you are Grandmaster Krav Maga - is to spend all your cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler decided to put his immune system and gag reflex to a severe test - by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Traveler moderator Ian Wright (51), a Suffolk-born man, used his tongue to lick a euro bill, a Piccadilly Circus railing, a flush button on a train toilet and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting himself into.
However, the experiment that led to Lickhiker&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength yielded interesting results.
The idea of licking a flush button on a train that has been used by thousands of other people may seem utterly repulsive, but there are actually many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink, for example.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about boosting the bacteria in the gut flora and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left anything worse than taste in his mouth.
Ian Wright became famous for testing the resilience of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public railings at train stations to a flush
In the film he made about it, he says: &quot;I haven&#39;t taken much care of my health since I was a child, and I&#39;ve put everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and muddy water.&quot;
He certainly confirmed his reputation in the film.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swab, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have made a traveler&#39;s film called The Lickhiker&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in various places, such as in the bathroom.
In the film, he said, &quot;This is almost the most disgusting thing I&#39;ve ever felt in the bathroom.&quot;
There is nothing dirtier than this!
I won&#39;t lick anything because it&#39;s disgusting here.
Lickhiker&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio&#39;s senior vice president of snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something to watch with interest while allowing us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea &quot;let&#39;s call Ian.&quot;
Interest in gut health is said to be becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a worldwide phenomenon, and through this document we have provided consumers with more detailed information in an interesting way.
I also think that there is a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: &quot;Let&#39;s put it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted from him - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.&quot;
It was naturally easier for Ian to lick some things, while others were pretty hard.
I&#39;m glad we filmed licking some of the dirty stuff. &quot;
In 2015, Valio conducted a survey according to which 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent of respondents stated that they used products containing added lactic acid bacteria, at least occasionally.
A family of socially needy destroyed a municipal building in Saltash, Cornwall, before moving out
A family of socially needy left £ 50,000 in damage to their townhouse after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their homes in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, the housing association officials were shocked to find that the property was in a state of disrepair.
There were holes in the walls, the flooring was torn, garbage was rolling everywhere on the floor, and the walls were smudged.
The family has already moved out and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried that the house would be salvaged.
She said: &quot;It was a nightmare for the people here and I don&#39;t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property is likely to become known as a &quot;not so nice part&quot; of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their names are notorious.
The couple has three sons, who have occasionally stayed at the house, and police said the family&#39;s horrors included street fights using baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug use, drug distribution and loud shouting, quarrels and swearing.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned in the lease, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
Smelly garbage was found in several rooms in a house that may be demolished.
The house where the drugs had been distributed in the past had a torn floor covering
Neighbors say they saw them fighting in the street, and people called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after being given an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors relieved welcomed the eviction, saying that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, &quot;They didn&#39;t care about anyone at all.&quot;
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always like that.
The number of times we have seen the police here cannot be counted at all.
&quot;We couldn&#39;t sleep this morning.&quot;
We got up because there was an incredible silence - we&#39;re not used to it!
It&#39;ll be nice when they&#39;re finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisory manager in Cornwall Housing&#39;s neighborhood, said the family was unable to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Garbage and old toys lay in the overgrown part of the town hall
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant was unable to accept responsibility for her own behavior and for the behavior of her family. Eviction is always the last step Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to a witness, must have terrified her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bring with it the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said all three tenant sons who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress that remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after moving out
Workers will now have to remove the piles of rubbish left behind around the house
In 2014, shelves raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, scales, equipment and £ 1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of the Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended for the foundation of a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth after the eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crow of Den and Cornwall police said the eviction was a clear message to other tenants who would continue to break the rules.
&quot;This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity and to those who would like to follow such behavior,&quot; she said.
The Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after a low-flying military jet over the beach
Tourists enjoying the sunshine in Aveiro, Portugal, were scared to death
The aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion flew incredibly low
The Air Force stated that this was a training flight and insisted that there was no threat to safety
As the low-flying jet descended over the crowded beach, frightened tourists panicked.
The dramatic footage shows a military plane approaching a distance almost to the touch from sunbathing people on a sandy beach near the town of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet engines, without seeing them emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic flight on social media, said: &quot;The plane flew twice really low and at one point seemed to crash.&quot;
Nuno Arroja adds: &quot;I was surfing and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.&quot;
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a plane flying low appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing boat off the coast and had to fly low because it was the only way to inspect the boat.
The plane allegedly flew a little lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the Air Force insists that human safety has not been compromised.
This summer, forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to thick fog and smoke from fires that blocked his view
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (CTIA) found out during inspections in the second quarter.
According to her, funeral services most often do not inform the survivors about their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The CTIA imposed 41 fines for this in the total amount of 73,000 crowns.
Today, its spokesman Jiří Fröhlich informed about it.
Inspectors found errors in 47 of 95 inspections.
In addition to information on prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labeled and once the seller used an officially unverified meter.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
This concerned urn packaging, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
&quot;As the law is still being violated in this specific area of services, the inspection will continue in the next quarter of this year,&quot; Fröhlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who had left London last year to join IS, had died in Syria.
Tasnime lawyer Akunjee said the family learned of her death in Rakka, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that it was probably killed during the Russian air attack in Rakka, which is the bastion of the group in the country.
The sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
&quot;One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers of going to war - is to discourage people from ever making a decision,&quot; Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana&#39;s family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within a few months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, she will keep Garland as a Supreme Court candidate.
Senate Democrat leader Harry Reid says he believes Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is nominating Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland&#39;s appointment, although President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person to replace the deceased Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
During a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he believes Clinton will select Garland &quot;with a degree of credibility.&quot;
Reid&#39;s spokeswoman later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he was only speculating.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to &quot;rock the ship&quot; by choosing someone else.
Garland is chairman of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Reid said Republicans who block Garland&#39;s appointment are &quot;minions&quot; and &quot;henchmen&quot; of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was out of office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars for &quot;women and men&quot;
Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to publish a calendar for 2017, inspired by the Pirelli calendar from the 1970s.
But instead of revealed celebrities, they are trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nudity magazine is different from old-school Playboy because &quot;Playboy is for men.&quot;
I do it for women.
Evidently he believes the calendar as well.
&quot;We need to return to depicting timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of a woman&#39;s body,&quot; Shaw said in a press release to release the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it&#39;s a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl going: who really buys turntables?
Vinyl is loved by lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to flood the comments section with peppery notes under the pseudonym Not All Lonely Men in Middle Ages, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of gramophone records is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to enjoy the originality of owning a physical object, but with the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who recently bought an album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It&#39;s not really about accumulating an enthusiastic fan - it all has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov&#39;s results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a television report, the camera would watch me strike the busy streets of Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesturing widely. Then I would stop, reach out, and say something authoritative, like, &quot;Let&#39;s take a look.&quot;
So let&#39;s take a look at it.
As Soho&#39;s charm and charm slowly fade from the heart - buildings once occupied by independent vendors are now filled with hotels, restaurants and canteens, ready-to-wear and office supplies - several fantastic specialty record stores remain.
I&#39;d probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I will stand close to the various men in these stores and try to observe their age and emotional state.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and is looking at shops to fill several hours of time.
I ask him if he is a collector.
&quot;I think so,&quot; he says.
I have about 3 or 4 thousand recordings.
All those recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me a photo by e-mail, I didn&#39;t follow him all the way home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy records that he couldn&#39;t afford when they were originally released, and he buys what he sold when he was young and didn&#39;t even have a windmill.
&quot;A lot of what I buy is from the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s. These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12. At that time, I was too small to buy them, ”he says.
He agrees that those who buy recordings are probably introverts who like the company of themselves. He adds: &quot;I don&#39;t smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez, 25, works for Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who have heard of the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old records back.
According to my interviews, people got rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their records and bought CDs now sell their CDs to buy back their records, ”he says.
This could explain the boom of turntable lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramophone records?
It doesn&#39;t take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you will find a pleasant community of like-minded people in music stores.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly outraged by the contactless payment system.
Some record fans may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of record covers, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
&quot;I think filling a gap or owning something tangible can bring some comfort,&quot; says Wez.
I&#39;m a collector myself, that&#39;s how it is for me and I think for a lot of people as well.
It&#39;s an easy way to fill the space in your head.
&quot;We are all like their social workers!&quot; Says a co-worker from a pile of gramophone records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not have a turntable.
At this point in the report, he was probably looking seriously concerned about going through a pile of bossa nova compilations.
The &quot;trophy&quot; aspect and the revival of interest is something that Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of the Universe (count: three middle-aged men), noticed.
&quot;Someone recently came in and said,&quot; I don&#39;t have a turntable yet, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can display it on the shelf, &quot;he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It&#39;s more about the product side than the music.
People come to us who say, &quot;I don&#39;t have a turntable.&quot;
These are younger people, not older, grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has a much more diverse number of visitors when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn&#39;t as relaxed as it used to be in stores - the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex is heard from the speakers instead of dragging jazz, it&#39;s good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but intrusive mental trauma is hard to guess when you&#39;re standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks in Fopp for a few minutes and looks at various gramophone records at a discount.
She is one of those who looks at shop windows rather than spending frantically.
According to her, she doesn&#39;t make much money, so it is out of the question for her to collect gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It&#39;s easy to listen to music on your computer or something. But gramophone records have their charm ..., &quot;he sighs longingly.
I can&#39;t explain it - it&#39;s unique.
My last stop is a shop that allegedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and watch a group of teenage girls gather around Polaroid cameras. Then the father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase covered by the gramophone records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It&#39;s purely a &quot;vinyl trick&quot;.
But because any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there&#39;s not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where more time and money are more likely than in other areas, is also the one where most is spent on the most luxurious goods that vinyl certainly is.
But while in my findings, YouGov&#39;s results seem to be accurate - at least in record stores, they don&#39;t take into account the large number of vinyl collectors and lovers that actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn&#39;t spend Thursday morning wandering the record stores on Berwick Street, going through the recordings, and avoiding the sight of a strange, 30-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland Shark is the longest living vertebrate - video report
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters
A court in France has refused to demolish shops in the Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected an order from the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to thousands of refugees.
During a trial this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to close a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents or basic meals in makeshift restaurants. for a few euros.
The prefect&#39;s office in Calais argued that the sites needed to be demolished because they were a parallel, tax-free economy and because of the risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations said in court that shops and restaurants were vital and that the free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups did not provide food for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
The disputed makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from operating 72 makeshift businesses, but said the prefect of the prefect of Calais was &quot;perfectly understandable.&quot;
Judge Jean-François Molla said food stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role to play than just serving food to people who &quot;live in extremely desperate conditions.&quot;
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites threatened with demolition was a non-profit cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the &quot;children&#39;s&quot; café.
The Guardian received a letter stating that closing the café &quot;would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.&quot;
The charities Help Refugess and L&#39;Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp had risen to more than 9,000 after a sharp increase in arrivals during the summer - the highest ever.
He thought he was dead.
Ulč resurfaces itself and the volleyball team Ústí.
&quot;I have been able to train normally since March,&quot; he reported at the start of the summer training in full force.
What did you feel?
I had bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems.
Because when I was at the Universiade in Korea, I didn&#39;t know I had any blood problems.
So the long flight to Asia caused trouble?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn&#39;t know about it.
It hurt, no one found anything.
Then the precipitate got up.
There is a damaged vein in the calf, it will still hurt, especially when it is wet or the weather is changing.
But nothing that would limit me, more an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
He had.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnice, I didn&#39;t know I had an embolism, and I couldn&#39;t move there at all.
I vomited blood in the evening.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was completely settled for five days.
In fact, in Dřevěnice, I thought I was dead, as were my girlfriends and family.
I&#39;ve seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it&#39;s just going up.
I know I have some blood problems, I have to watch more when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Just when I wanted to return to the preparation of Příbram last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything is fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I&#39;ll knock it, I&#39;m physically better than before.
What do you expect from Ústí?
I&#39;m looking forward, the bunch looks good, I know most of the guys.
I&#39;m curious about two more foreigners coming.
Maybe we&#39;ll sit humanly to make it fit together.
Will you lift Ústí?
It had a reputation as a bat, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now it is second.
There is a new team in Ústí, only a few players remain.
It was the last in the extraleague, so there is a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We will see after the first rounds who will be beaten up, we probably won&#39;t.
Is Coach Brom a Guarantee of Success?
He is already experienced and has experienced a lot, he will think of better than the last place.
But my arrival was not related to it, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I am a great friend with one and it was agreed that he will work here.
I won&#39;t say the name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I&#39;m glad.
He has a big name, he has been in good clubs, he has been coaching for many decades, he is a good former player.
It will move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to talk and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top team.
I was in Příbram for two years, but Ústí is more of a challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, Australian Boehm is already training in Ústí.
How it looks?
Coincidentally, I know him, at the university we played against each other in a group.
And we had fun there a few times, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the matches, so we already know each other in a friendly way.
We beat them 3: 1, I immediately poured it at the start of the summer training in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he is a nice guy.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to an American, he looks like a nice boy, a Brazilian knows how he will know English.
Did you contact the American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I&#39;m a recorder, so the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player he is, I found him playing on the internet, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the boy jumps, he&#39;s tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he would fit in with us.
How are you looking forward to the position of record number one?
I didn&#39;t want to take anything else.
After all, I will be twenty-four and I do not have the character to take turns.
I&#39;d rather be at the center of the action, I&#39;d rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I probably wouldn&#39;t want to play anymore if I had to be the second recorder and devote myself to it at full time. When something isn&#39;t done to the fullest, it&#39;s worth it.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in Příbram, when it was not possible for Kust as captain, he was injured, then there were problems with money and he left.
We&#39;ve been climbing up ever since and I&#39;ve been playing all the time.
In Brno, of which I am a pupil, I alternated between one and two.
An excellent year was in the Old Town, after that I had a lot of offers and I chose Příbram.
Budejovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I didn&#39;t finish the season due to the embolism.
Now it&#39;s a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short half remains Phelps&#39; domain.
&quot;Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever,&quot; Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancée and mother cheered in the auditorium again, this time Boomer&#39;s son slept peacefully with headphones on.
I&#39;m having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It&#39;s crazy - I started swimming competitively 20 years ago and it will be over in a few hours, he said moved.
In the final, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won a long position, lagged behind Phelps by almost two seconds.
The bronze was won by the Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year&#39;s World Cup.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to dominate the same discipline in four games in a row.
For most of the race, Phelps was led by another American, Ryan Lochte, and home team Thiago Perreira.
While the gold advocate in the final cadre fifty deployed to a crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the position, the butterfly advanced to the finals of the 100-meter race.
The legend could not be overshadowed by compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won a double of the mark - after a hundred he won a double track in Rio.
In the final, he left behind 37-hundredths of the Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third was finished by the Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While from last year&#39;s World Cup Murphy has only the fifth place out of two hundred, in Rio he became the king of characters.
He removed Larkin from the imaginary throne, who managed the same double at last year&#39;s world championship.
But at the Olympics, he only won a medal.
Canadian Penny Oleksiaková and American Simone Manuel shared the gold medal in the crawling hundred.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiakova it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuel the second after the silver from the relay.
She was the first African-American woman in history to win swimming gold at the Olympics.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sport becomes love for them and they get to where I go, said moved Manuel.
The third was the Swede Sarah Sjöström, who won the world record in the 100-meter bow tie in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the crawling two hundred.
Australian world record holder Cate Campbell finished sixth.
The breast race was won by the Japanese Rie Kanetová, for whom it is the first Olympic medal in the age of twenty-seven.
She has no precious metal from the World Cup, her maximum was fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver medal in Rio was won by Russia&#39;s Yulia Yefimova, who, despite her doping past, is struggling with the hostility of spectators and opponents.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court and I don&#39;t know why I should always answer these questions.
I&#39;m so tired of it, said the Russian swimmer.
She only demanded the right to start in Rio at a special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, should they go to an arbitral tribunal, she added.
Hermann: Disappointed, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don&#39;t remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
Only less than an hour before the match, they learned who they would play against.
They had to master tactical training in a flash.
And then, in an unconventional time, they started the match on the small court number 1.
The first set did not start well, then they caught the lead of the opponents, but at 19:19 they did not manage the end.
In the second, they were clearly better and leveled, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
Above all, a number of broken services meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
&quot;We could have defeated the Russians,&quot; Hermann regretted.
How would you rate the match?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start, before I started, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, in the last balloon, the reception I was used to before flew by.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set, we boarded them with an overview of the field, another defense and we pushed for service.
There were terribly bad serve in the tie-break, we took it there on this side.
It was a disappointment because we could beat the Russian.
Sluková: Too bad at the beginning of the first set, we missed it there.
We were able to download it, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and the third was decided by the service.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was five of them, we hesitated a lot there.
It&#39;s a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the small yard number 1?
Slukova: Similar to China in the backyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one o&#39;clock in the morning, complete silence, no music, nothing anywhere.
That was the difference from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
How was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was weird.
We started warming up for the match without knowing our opponents, so we couldn&#39;t do tactical training like the other teams.
But Simon (coach Nausch) prepared tactics for almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so we were pretty well prepared for this.
Remember ever starting a match at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at half past ten, but not at twelve.
Russian Birlov&#39;s block in the preliminary round of the playoffs at the Rio Olympics.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermannová in an embrace in the preliminary round of the playoffs at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: Since we have played the last two matches in the group since ten, we had the mode shifted earlier.
This was two more hours.
It&#39;s weird, I can&#39;t imagine another sport having athletes who have to perform at their best at twelve o&#39;clock.
But I think we prepared as best we could.
We knew it would be like that, but it&#39;s not entirely typical and it probably won&#39;t be my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the progress from the group was our goal, it&#39;s okay on the one hand, good.
We did what we said.
But now I&#39;m sad after the match.
Sluková: I will sleep from it and from tomorrow I will only remember the Olympic tournament positively.
Big brother is here, the first scrambling SIM is coming.
You won&#39;t escape her.
The new rules are to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to obtain a SIM from one of the local operators during their stay in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-stay visas who, for example, work or get married in Thailand.
Takorn Tantasith, Secretary General of the National Broadcasting Authority and the Telecommunications Commission, said that there would be no exceptions.
The plan for the sale of SIMs intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The authorities intend to introduce a new measure to monitor their location within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security, which will make it possible to solve crimes committed by foreigners.
In addition, the so-called tourist SIMs are intended to help detect people who exceed the permitted length of stay.
Within six months, special SIMs for foreigners should appear at retailers alongside SIMs intended exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently switched on for cards intended for persons without a Thai passport.
It will not be possible to turn it off.
&quot;This feature is not for Thai people because we can always easily track them,&quot; added Tantasith.
It is necessary to add that in Thailand subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators distributed free start-up SIMs to tourists at airports.
They were thus completely anonymous.
Ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are also considering introducing the same measure as Thailand.
Mandatory SIM registration still applies in them, however, legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not mean an obligation for foreigners to obtain a local operator&#39;s SIM when entering the country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
Operators in a given country only know the relevant network information after crossing the border, ie after the SIM logs in to their network.
So they know the phone number, but not the information about the owner.
However, the difference between roaming prices and local operator rates is so abysmal that even most tourists start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities&#39; efforts to monitor the movement of foreigners have legally received immediate criticism from foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in connection with the protection of privacy, compares the planned system to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order to monitor a particular person.
Any misuse of the system will result in an unspecified penalty.
&quot;If the service provider monitors the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a crime,&quot; Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While at present a specific number will be recycled after a 90-day period has elapsed, after which the SIM has not logged on to the network, in the event of leaving Thailand, the number could be renewed after only fifteen days.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and whirlpool on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the care for the property will be taken care of by the administrator.
The condition was enough parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified older buildings.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with swinging the floor, high energy consumption and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old buildings are not able to offer.
You can find other interesting visits in the magazine Moderní byt.
The whole interior was designed for you by the architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you address them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with an architect to everyone if he designs an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client&#39;s wishes, are able to match the interior appropriately.
We have already worked with the architect Lenka Langerová on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation from another client, and given that everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us when reconstructing our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social and living space with adequate facilities for a family of four, conceived as a modern but not cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and implement intelligent home control.
And, of course, the quality of the design had to be monitored.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you intervene in the final form of the interior yourself?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and material samples, however, the design always came from the architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špála or Otto Gutfreund, helped the architect to orient himself in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the architect&#39;s idea as well as the individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then verified whether they fit together together using visualizations.
Did there arise any complications during the implementation, due to which you had to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, accept new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the construction site when it was possible to ascend to the height of our floor for the first time, and found that the views we had planned actually overshadowed the surrounding buildings.
That&#39;s when we literally changed the layout from the ground up overnight.
Granite was used on both the kitchen counter and the paneling of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, for example on the upholstery of dining and bar stools Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you planning any changes or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I think that this is a modern airy interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
We are not planning changes, most of the modifications after moving in took place in the level of shading and inhabiting the terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, where walnut wood turns out to be too delicate for a household with a dog.
Word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the top floor of a new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several other modifications within the construction.
An important element for the interior is the placement of light guides in the ceiling of the corridor and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight in the darker areas of the apartment.
Also direct access from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications, which was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and hot tub.
You are not negative compared to the French, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live everywhere before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, not far from the Spanish border.
I&#39;ve moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, thanks to which I got a job in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I was beginning to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn&#39;t want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere among the people.
It occurred to me that every Frenchman was terribly negative.
People in France are in a negative mood in general, but it has gotten worse lately.
It is interesting that you mention negativism.
This is how some people evaluate the Czech nature.
Believe me, you are not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not find it so when they come to France, because they don&#39;t perceive it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
Money is a big topic.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is also the problem of people&#39;s behavior towards Muslims.
This is completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, on the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
As if I were some evil.
That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I admit that I didn&#39;t know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn&#39;t know what to expect from Prague.
I&#39;ve been here for three years now and I can&#39;t imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly due to a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t speak Czech, so I can&#39;t catch any negative reactions or swearing, but I feel that people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress any way and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is still looking at you uncomfortably, for example when you have special clothes and the like.
In Prague, I started to feel really free.
I think Praguers don&#39;t care about such things.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then another friend and I set up a website where people offer and look for shared housing.
So far, we only operate in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are half Czechs, and two more Czech friends.
I must say that another specific feature of the Czechs is that they initially keep their distance more.
He won&#39;t let anyone get to his body right away.
That&#39;s quite the difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone is hugging and kissing on the cheek.
It&#39;s different here, but I understand it&#39;s a cultural issue, so I&#39;m trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don&#39;t speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it&#39;s quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in convenience stores or in groceries.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don&#39;t have that much time.
And because everyone can communicate at least a little in English, I don&#39;t have that need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there is someone to help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you&#39;re a Muslim?
Basically not.
Maybe it&#39;s also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience strikes me.
My leader, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something along the lines of: It&#39;s not the French, it&#39;s the Africans.
That quite touched me.
But that someone has a problem with being a Muslim has not happened to me yet.
This is despite the fact that a colleague once alerted me to some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go downtown to curse me.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels may happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that anything can happen anywhere today.
Until recently, for example, I could not imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it&#39;s not just Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
To me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur&#39;an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists are protected by your faith?
It&#39;s very difficult.
I feel ashamed and guilty, even though I shouldn&#39;t feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence too much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that is not really my fault.
I&#39;m a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met on the square of George of Podebrady.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians demonstrated against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn&#39;t know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they do not agree with violence.
I don&#39;t think they have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty about something they didn&#39;t cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues are, for example, from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religiously based than I am, so we sometimes have quite wild discussions about Islam because we each perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through another education, for example, they learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate position of a woman.
How do you perceive it?
I don&#39;t feel submissive in any way.
On the contrary.
I am a woman, I have strength.
This is also related to the fact that you do not wear any headgear.
For example, the hijab?
And it is mainly the way I was brought up to sign that.
For example, my mother is a truly principled Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn&#39;t wear a headscarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone how he interprets it.
When one reads the Qur&#39;an, one should form one&#39;s own opinion on those things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur&#39;an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet&#39;s wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I arrive in Iran or Saudi Arabia, for example, where scarves are required, I take it.
Do you plan to stay in Prague?
So far.
Nowhere else did I feel so good.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I&#39;m great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
In my opinion, Prague is an ideal city for that.
Czech Muslims, along with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
The wind in Rio blew the yacht Kozelská Fenclová to the rungs.
Friday&#39;s rides at sea in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were published by Czech yachtswoman Veronica Kozelská Fenclová.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved up to tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure the Czech Republic&#39;s participation in the final race.
You collect packages like Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea to use the already planned trips for the transport of consignments is TV director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, they breathed life into three applications with different geographical reach.
We launched the national Převez application in May.
At the moment, a thousand cities are uploaded to it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we first want to learn this before we focus more abroad, says a 41-year-old manager in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How does Převezu work and who can benefit from it?
Download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and information on how big a package you can transport and how much you want for it.
Someone may be asking for a transport that day.
When the route and the delivery time are suitable, it is paired and both are notified.
At that moment, a chat opens where the couple arranges a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register in order for each package to always find its own courier?
I don&#39;t know the ideal situation, I can&#39;t estimate how many registered and how many trips are needed to ensure optimal coverage and each offer is matched by the demand.
It already works on the main routes and it is logically easier than, for example, on the way between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
So far, people are also building their trust and finding out that no one will run away with the package.
So far, you haven&#39;t had to deal with such a case?
How many users have the service two months after launch?
We currently have about 5,000 to 6,000 people creating roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that others will emerge.
Isn&#39;t there a danger that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be a competition for large conglomerates simply because we are able to deliver the thing on the same day, for a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you pay, for example, a hundred or less, because this is a path that someone is already taking.
Should traditional carriers be worried about a possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, with huge multinational carriers feeding here, as well as retail chains where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality did not match what they were paying for.
Nobody wants to find a ticket in the mailbox with the message that they should pick up the shipment at the branch, at the earliest the day after 7 pm.
At that time, I had needed the package for six hours and was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that will not bother anyone and send a signal to the competition, no matter how hard they try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
Neither has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned trips between the world&#39;s capitals, especially by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to develop a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD, for example.
The programming lasted three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
They started developing the Převez application in December last year and released it in May this year.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mesík and Mesík Profi application has been developed since January this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to make all these applications from the beginning, which will one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
Shared economy has been a topic lately, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Are you not worried about operating in an area that no one can say much about, where the border of sharing is and where the gray economy is?
It&#39;s the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the side through the gray economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to circumvent the tax authorities and tax audits.
Every user, on the one hand or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make money from it.
How do you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns or reduces travel costs.
That is the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we would like them to bring this one closer together.
Nice stories can be made, people are happy to help someone and will talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
In my opinion, people have been missing a personal approach for a long time, we say about this application that it is a service of people to people.
So how do you ensure that the courier does not run away with the package?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans the ID card and states the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give credibility to the service and to the person.
Couriers also collect stars based on sender ratings.
We also offer insurance, we are still tuning the details.
The courier is liable for the uninsured consignment in the event of loss or damage, but does not accept liability for the content under criminal law if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a submachine gun or ten kilos of hashish in a closed package in his suitcase, criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
If necessary, the registered persons can be traced by an administrative body, which will be the only one able to look into it, nor are we able to see them ourselves, the data are protected against misuse.
How much money will the courier receive after the successful delivery of the shipment?
The courier determines the price and receives the full amount he asks for.
The sender is charged an extra percentage for arranging the contact.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent because we want to push for volume.
Also, no one can accuse the courier of not delivering the shipment when it actually delivered it, and receipt and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a platter of eggs and as large as a bass of beer.
Then there is no further restriction and if someone has a place in the car, they will take the refrigerator, for example.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don&#39;t even have to pack the thing if you don&#39;t want to hide the contents.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier&#39;s hand and that&#39;s it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
A friend got the idea more than two years ago, at that time I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational reach, which is aimed mainly at air passengers.
At that moment, I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put savings into it.
The development took another year before we established Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the entire product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on now.
No, we focused our marketing on the Czechia, where we are trying to catch up with the application, because it all had labor pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to respond to feedback from customers and we are not dealing so much with the foreign market at the moment.
We know it&#39;s a long run, but we&#39;re not rushing, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgrades.
The transfer originated when we thought that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application by Mesík is local, for the city.
But it can send the package to the exact address to the other side of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Transport, but the difference is that in it, as a courier, you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your mobile phone.
We called the application for couriers who want to make a living from the Profi Month.
So can anyone earn extra money by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded in Prague, for example, by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to travel to work.
As everyone is fooling around with those Pokémon now, they can collect this just the same.
One sees where the orders are in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it must be delivered and transports the shipment.
It&#39;s set up cheaper than competing services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface, which will be crucial for companies to send shipments, they will fill in data about them on the web, ie they will create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them for the use of the service, for example, every month.
Are you working on the project full time now?
It benefits us, but we normally have it at work so that we can feed and develop the project.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with other stimuli and ideas.
We are now looking for an investor strong enough to catch up with us, not the Czech market, but who, with the pardon of the ball, should go with us to a global product and become another huge player in the market such as AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be more varied than in Call of Duty, according to the first information.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of net competition in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to freedom of movement, which in addition to running also includes the ability to use a combat titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will include levels focused on agile movement.
They will resemble platformers and include puzzles.
For example, double jumps, running on walls and a rope slide are essential to overcome them.
Sometimes, in addition, it will be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to raise and lower platforms and close massive doors.
You will modify the shape of the battlefield.
As a result, the pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and calmer moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We will play as Jack Cooper&#39;s pawn dreaming of a pilot&#39;s career.
At the start of the campaign, Cooper and Captain Lastimosa are shipwrecked on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And the wilderness there won&#39;t be forgiving to him either.
In addition, Lastimosa will receive fatal wounds in an accident, so Cooper will be tasked with putting the captain&#39;s titan into operation.
His dream of a pilot career will come true sooner than he expected.
But the first step will be to steal the battery needed for the robot&#39;s repair.
Cooper&#39;s calls with titanium will also be significant.
It will serve as a source of information for players about the soldier&#39;s past, but at the same time humorous moments will be created by the robot&#39;s depersonalized communication.
For example, if the titanium dryly lists all the injuries that Cooper is threatened during the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was provided by the Polygon server.
In addition, it will be possible to assess the result in just two months, and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28, for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original label remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the THQ publishing house in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the company name.
Thanks to this, Nordic has released, for example, the Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition or the Red Faction Collection.
In addition, another 23 games are being created for the publishing house, and 13 of them have not yet been discovered by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a man twenty years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - at first she obviously tried for a long time, then they got together.
He&#39;s such a big guy, probably her type, because she dated a similar person in front of me.
She went completely crazy for him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girlish, amorous voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I watched it all.
He was then out of work regularly at half past three, so she always left at three to buy.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later, I found out that they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there.
I got the keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don&#39;t know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I could never go there, take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife controlled me mentally.
I soon found out that I was controllable, that I would do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I&#39;m just such a slippers.
At the same time, the neighbors then indicated to me that they also knew about it.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
Only the daughter knew that it would affect everyone in the family.
So I always put it off, over and over.
But once I went to his apartment to see that I needed help with something in the laundry.
He went there with me and I told him that I had gotten an anonymous, that he was dating my wife and that everything indicated that.
I asked him what he would tell me.
He stood there, shrugging, looking at the ground, and didn&#39;t say a word.
Then at that time I also met his wife on the way out of the store.
I told her, but she didn&#39;t believe it at all.
She didn&#39;t react to it and she didn&#39;t tell me anything.
Nobody told me anything then.
I am such a person who has never gone much anywhere, who has a problem meeting someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn&#39;t even think about divorce.
I kept counting on it to end one day.
I thought I would forgive her for it all and life would go on.
But it was not so.
And I basically never dealt with it all.
I still have it in me.
I used to tell her quite often, but in the end I left it for peace.
He continues to live in the house next door and I continue to live with her.
It&#39;s just that my housewife is more like my wife.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She is hardworking.
In my opinion, she always tried not to have another reason to complain.
And you can say that she is also good.
But sometimes I want to stroke her, hug her and she won&#39;t let go.
We go for walks and shopping together and everyone thinks how happy our marriage is.
But she once told me she never loved me.
That she loved me and loves me, but that she didn&#39;t love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, he is her god.
And I don&#39;t like such a life.
Even when it started and I bore it very badly, I once told her that I didn&#39;t want to live and asked what she would say if I finished it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that&#39;s what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, &quot;But there&#39;s plenty of room here.&quot;
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
Following the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up the fight against radical Islamists and calling on the government and the local Muslim minority for help.
&quot;If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion,&quot; said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual educators in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where preachers inoculated with jihad often come with the money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Even then, it was to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, she was struck by internal contradictions, so she never worked properly.
&quot;It&#39;s a total failure,&quot; Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are about 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and several dozen more are considering the move.
This week, German police also intervened against jihadist clerics.
The imams allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated an area where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate erupted in France over a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
Everything was accelerated by further terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists on behalf of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to secure funding for mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
However, it is not yet clear where to obtain funding, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, ie especially for meat from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food vendors for the granting of a permit.
Part of the money would then go to the foundation&#39;s budget.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims going to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them set out from France for the traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, only preachers who have undergone educational programs at universities should work in French mosques.
As a result, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
&quot;We have closed twenty of them since December and more will follow,&quot; said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
&quot;In France, there is no place for those who proclaim hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,&quot; he said.
Zaragoza.
An unknown shooter was seriously injured by his ex-wife on Friday morning at a shopping center in Zaragoza, northern Spain, the Independent reports.
The shooting took place after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the mall, from where he also started firing.
According to witnesses, the man then turned his weapon against himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for a man in critical condition.
The crime took place around 11:00 in the central part of the capital of the Autonomous Community of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame seaweed, ginger and chili sauce.
Summer wishes for light, easily digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so the summer gardens smell of grilled necks, bacon, pork knuckles.
Nothing very healthy, nothing too light, even so sometimes except for salad or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecuing is time and dish saving, in addition it is a social affair and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to make good delicacies that make dining special, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to boil, bake, fry or stew anything for a long time.
And they also contribute to our health.
Whether it&#39;s homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality ingredients and a few well-masted griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today&#39;s recipe.
This eliminates even more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be softened into water for a moment, and then it only depends on the chef&#39;s imagination how he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
Algae is not like algae.
The advantage of many dishes of Asian cuisine today is that the ingredients are usually commonly available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic delicacies accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can also prepare it at home, but real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and at the same time delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
All you have to do is buy a bag of the right size, and the side dish with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used mainly in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate dishes as part of various ceremonial occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed leaves of the banana tree are very widespread in many countries in Asia and South America as well as a &quot;tool&quot; for the preparation of various baked, cooked and fried foods, which are packed in them similarly to foil.
The banana leaf then imparts a specific flavor to the dish.
You can buy them in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into circles.
However, choose only the leaves are deep green, and therefore healthy - uncracked and without spots.
It is similarly easy to prepare a salad of wakame seaweed, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought frozen again.
Anyone who eats or prepares sushi often will probably know especially nori seaweed.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which so-called nori leaves are made by chopping, pressing and drying - plates intended just for making sushi.
Wakame - a dark green alga growing in the waters around Hokkaido Island - is also eaten fresh and dried and is as popular as nori algae.
By the way, who doesn&#39;t know miso soup with wakame, Asian women have reportedly used it since time immemorial for postpartum recovery.
And in general, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and mashed wakame also serves as a spice, for example to flavor rice.
Fresh algae is first infused in water, then rinsed, placed in boiling water and cooked for half a minute.
Then they are cooled in ice water, the central ribs are cut out and further prepared, for example as a favorite salad.
However, buying it ready-made, frozen is the simplest solution.
All that remains is to wrap a roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomb.
If you resist and don&#39;t throw in an extra grilled bacon.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
All you need is a few special ingredients and a little dexterity, and you have an interesting fresh food that deliciously combines tastes.
And it&#39;s done once or twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g white radish, 100 g green asparagus, 60 g cucumber salad, 60 g wakame seaweed and 60 g sweet chili sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chili sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First we prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, cook the asparagus sprouts briefly in hot water, and after about three minutes, let them cool quickly in ice water so that they do not lose color.
Put the vegetable filling on the allowed paper and wrap it.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrot and cucumber, which we cut into fine strips, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and place on rice paper.
Put asparagus shoots on a banana leaf, add rolls and finally garnish the whole dish with wakame seaweed, pickled ginger, a slice of mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain has to settle for silver in seventh rugby, Fiji&#39;s selection takes gold
The impressive performance of Great Britain in seventh rugby ended with a devastating track on the last hurdle, Fiji defeated the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43: 7.
The Fijians demonstrated a master&#39;s lesson in processing, dump, dodging, support play, line running and brutal force - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unseen consolation prize in the form of a silver medal - the third for Britain on the day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Seven Rugby Olympics, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The won over South Africans 7: 5 in the semifinals on the same day may have froze in the final.
However, Fiji in its form would defeat a 15-member team in full health.
It may not be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their neck tomorrow: the main coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former head of England at Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan&#39;s leadership, they lost every match in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began magnificently, reflecting the British penetrations for pleasure.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his other teammates, it was like running behind a row of buses in motion, and the World Cup champions led 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from around the corner.
The timekeeper showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which there was a conversion.
12 - 0 and Britain could hardly touch the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only slowed down the Fijians.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw a touchdown in the right corner and the British lost 17: 0.
Nakarawa added another when he returned, and there was still more than 1 minute left in the class ... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouva then penetrated the sluggish British and rushed to the line, where he scored.
The conversion to 29: 0 was followed by a break.
It was as if Fiji was born for 7s rugby, while the British were still learning to pass.
That&#39;s exactly how it is.
The British made mass changes at half-time and stopped the onslaught of the Fijians ... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Joshua Tuisov&#39;s penetration continued after the brilliant Fiji interlude.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, throwing a touchdown into the left corner to raise an 36: 7. But the people of the Pacific Islands have long since won the match, and their fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was hard not to admire the utterly delighted attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the victory of the Fijians with another attempt.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell to the lawn completely subdued.
Earlier that day, Fiji defeated Japan 20: 5 in the semifinals, and the United Kingdom defeated South Africa in the close semifinals - by a difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown took the South Africans in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the defensive line thanks to his dazzling footwork and scored under the hook in the second half.
The great late dump of Marcus Watson, Anthony&#39;s brother of England&#39;s 15 team, secured the victory - and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired by the coach&#39;s battle with cancer to win the rowing race
You won&#39;t find more emotional gold in these Games - and that&#39;s what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing exhalations into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though there were two by the oars, there were three voices in the boat. When the boat whistled across the surface to meet the second Olympic gold in a row in the women&#39;s doubles race, the voice of the still present coach Robin Williams was still with them on the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sport to achieve such a result.
Their dominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent female athletes flying on the water surface with the elegance of a swan - does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every gold medal from rowing is a battalion of helping hands, which bit by bit make a difference. And no hand was more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn&#39;t know 30 months ago if he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that can be operated on, and I underwent this operation.
Anything could happen without surgery.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your view of things a bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Luckily for the whole trio, he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, and thus reduce the outage to a minimum - if we can call it that in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was the impetus.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps were enough.
That&#39;s how it started.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts of Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to manage his own restlessness.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, which has a mission in Afghanistan, said, &quot;I&#39;ve been at the bottom with emotion this week, maybe it&#39;s a little extreme, but it means so much.&quot;
It emphasizes again how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so did Robin.
So far, it&#39;s been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn&#39;t be anyone, so he deserves a huge thank you, he&#39;s the best coach in the world.
I couldn&#39;t wish for a better person for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair set a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were maximally focused at the given moment.
Helen shouted, &quot;Don&#39;t stop, don&#39;t stop.&quot;
It&#39;s really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn&#39;t want to achieve something famous.
We weren&#39;t looking forward to today&#39;s fireworks, we just wanted to hang out well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple takes a year to think before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, with her upcoming television adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn&#39;t want to say it would be my last race.
That would put too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it, &quot;she said.

Prison?
Rather, let people drive people for free, says taximia hunter Rubeš about the groundbreaking indictment.
According to ČT, six taxi drivers and a former municipal official in Prague are indicted.
You have made a number of reports in which you have revealed fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in a group that will stand trial.
You faced several unpleasant skirmishes with exposed actors.
How groundbreaking is the groundbreaking report on the indictment of members of an organized group?
I expected there to be a trial.
I&#39;m mainly curious about the verdict.
But I don&#39;t think they should be in jail.
This is useless.
They should primarily return all stolen money.
And they should return them by driving all people for free.
This is a somewhat peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you do not perceive a possible punishment as sufficiently effective?
It is enough for me that some of them are so afraid that they are no longer doing the job.
For example, one makes a pingle, another delivers pizza, and one completely coughed it up.
Defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with imprisonment.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in that case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to society what they have taken from it.
For a quarter of a century, they committed the destruction of our country and vulgarly robbed people.
So let them make a good business card now and deliver people for free.
I can&#39;t imagine it any other way.
It would work as a community service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they&#39;ll get a condition eventually and they won&#39;t care.
They&#39;ll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříček Film Academy in Písek and subsequently at Tomas Bata University in Zlín.
He is one of the people in the Czech Republic who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as an editor for the internet television Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, and is currently preparing the Prague Guide program, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rubeš advises them on which services he prefers to avoid in Prague and which, on the contrary, he recommends to use without fear.
He used to shoot a series called How to, Scam City ?, Living in Luxury, Enough! and Prague vs. Dust.
The indictment refers to them as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be described as mafia?
They are such cute mobsters, not the ones we know from the Godfather.
These are more mobsters - juniors, but they are definitely organized.
Only in the fact that they watch each other with stepladders (taxi ranks).
Prague is all subdivided.
I found out that, for example, the main railway station doesn&#39;t like Paris, the Paris doesn&#39;t like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Lázně (disco club)
Everyone just takes care of their place and each group is somehow organized.
It is probably a complex network.
However, a total of only seven people are accused, six taxi drivers and one former municipal official who warned drivers against checks.
As you say, the side effect has not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of Prague fraudsters in the taxi service, according to your estimate, is this?
It&#39;s a very small percentage.
The worst on the street are still there.
I am talking, for example, about Aleš Ryjáček.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by Charles Bridge and carries people.
The last time I rode with him, he wanted me seven hundred in three kilometers.
For some reason, his police did not detain him.
Only a few people from the whole large group were chosen.
However, the situation is the same in other locations in Prague.
The indictment of seven people therefore makes it difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague scandal, which probably has much larger dimensions.
Of course, it&#39;s completely useless.
It will help, but all evil will not be eradicated, it is true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still appear in the same places you showed in the reports, ie at Charles Bridge or in Pařížská Street?
Yes exactly.
They stand in these locations every day and break the ordinances every day.
Both the city police and the Prague City Hall ignore it.
It&#39;s not even a boy anymore, but complete indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Nevertheless, some of them, even if they are only part of the group, will go to court.
This is already a breakthrough.
I must therefore ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be for the center of Prague to improve.
And even if I feel that it needs to be a little better, I will continue to do so.
You need to push the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to eliminate him.
You can&#39;t be satisfied with that.
But this is not the case, of course there are more.
Are you still trying to confront them right in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it&#39;s still bad.
Just last week, I caught a taxi driver from the same group, by the way, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was the amount of 56 crowns (he used a trick with a decimal point).
He had a receipt for it, the police officers arrived, and this taxi driver was so cute that he still went to the police officers and asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver pasted a decimal point on the taximeter and robbed tourists of 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the audacity of fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed in your shots the faces of those who charged meaningless sums for a short ride?
Their audacity is still unbelievable.
What happened to the taxi driver demanding 56 crowns?
Police sent him away, saying they could not argue with him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And I think that will be a problem in the court as well (six taxi drivers and one ex-officer).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other side the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the municipality may not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming parts about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
But I always wanted to use the shots only for reporting.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them in court?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns per kilometer, because he would not make a living from it.
You talked about a trick with a decimal point, which is shifted by underwater taxi drivers, especially in front of foreign clients.
Is it still current, or are they afraid to continue to use this trick after publishing your reports?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I recently went with a taxi driver, bragging to me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed a black cardboard stuck to the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what it was there for, he told me, &quot;You do know what it is.&quot;
If fraudsters have not worked very well on fines, can they be warned by a court and their colleagues?
Is there anything that can deter them from fraud?
You talked about the fact that you think they would always find a way to cheat.
I don&#39;t think anything can discourage them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I must say that fortunately the fair taxi drivers in Prague predominate.
But do they want to go against those who ruin the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack art.
They can&#39;t walk much in it and they can&#39;t say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to a proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it was not very clear what they really wanted.
Once they said that they did not protest against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they claimed that they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they only blocked Prague and only the best possible advertisement for Uber was created.
Overall, how do you evaluate the approach of the Prague City Council in solving the problem of fare overcharge?
It can be seen that only the criminal police had to step in to solve something.
The municipality was short on that.
They had a mole there that carried information, which meant that the taxi department had been doing its job completely unnecessarily for several years.
I hope the official is charged to the last check for all the failed checks to realize what he did.
That is the worst thing for me.
I was even on one control ride with him, which I only found out from their schedule.
It has been several months since the last episodes of the series were published.
What is the response?
I think mainly of foreign viewers, on which the series is actually the most focused.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play the videos for them.
And when we walk around the Old Town Square, they are surprised that the same people who are seen in the footage are really standing there.
Infamous famous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I would build a fence around them for people to look at.
Museum of Communism right on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need to?
Clearly.
I go with services where I don&#39;t have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatch centers that are fair.
I only took a taxi on the street once since.
The driver told me after getting in the car, &quot;Well, you have the courage.&quot;
Bem disguised as an Italian tourist.
Fraudulent taxi driver practices were reported as early as 2005.
In the same year, former mayor Pavel Bém set out on a control ride disguised as an Italian tourist, and on the very first attempt, the driver cheated him by two hundred.
But editor Rubeš had worse experience.
The drivers of the taxi service charged him 820 crowns for the journey from the Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which is about 195 crowns per kilometer, as calculated by the creators of the reports.
The Prague City Hall set the maximum price at 28 crowns per kilometer.
There are also other surprising sums in the recorded report: for example, a two-kilometer journey from Pařížská Street to Truhlářská cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
For a ride to Anděl, which is 2.5 kilometers long, they charge, for example, six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemicals and the longer, the better.
Dirt goes well from it, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it has to be excavated from the folds.
It is not easy and it is not fast, the restorer Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichov in Háje presented her work.
Hat down in front of her: the tombstone is surrounded by scaffolding, which you have to climb up and down countless times.
&quot;The restorer should be careful, patient and easy to work with,&quot; she said.
This is far from the first restoration work in the Frýdlant region.
Thanks to it, the stone elements of the facade in the rear wing of Frýdlant Town Hall were restored, it also restored the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John of Nepomuk in Frýdlant, Pieta in Frýdlantská Okružní Street, the Marian Column in Frýdlant or Atlanta in the spa facade in Nové Město pod Smrkem .
The restoration of the tombstones of Melchior, Kryštof and Kateřina of Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; they will either be anchored to the wall or to each other.
Surface treatment and conservation is also waiting for them.
The inscriptions on the tomb are gilded again.
&quot;Then it will start with gilding the inscriptions on the marble slabs with pure gold leaf,&quot; said Věra Sobotová, a clerk at the State Monument Care of the Frýdlant Municipal Authority.
There are no records in the past of the tombstone undergoing any repairs.
On closer inspection, the holes drilled in the marble columns are fascinating.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the decoration of the tombstone.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years&#39; War, everything disappeared.
They literally combed the tombstone, Sobotová remarked.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, the restorers are at home with a slight exaggeration.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombstones that found themselves under water, the baptismal font, the murals in the tomb and now the tombstone were restored.
&quot;We would also like to start stained glass in the future,&quot; Sobotová revealed.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redern tombstone will cost a total of 128,000 crowns.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not invest any of its money in this part of the renovation.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from winning the regional round of the Historic City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns will be a contribution from the Ministry of Culture, specified the mayor of Frýdlant Dan Ramzer.
The council decided to release the prize for the restoration of the tombstone.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) at the horizon of one month and a half.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year.
The US S &amp; P500 index, which underwent a 12% correction in February, is now at a new all-time high and has gained 7 percent since the beginning of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interests of central banks in the long run, which in the end have always achieved their goal.
In a situation where US stocks are at an all-time high, volatility is disappearing again, currently the lowest since 2014, when markets grew contentedly and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the US Federal Reserve and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below 12 percent.
And not to.
Although the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual rise in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England also joined forces to buy £ 70bn bonds over the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative easing is thus pushing already low yields even lower and contributing to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That, of course, is a million-dollar question.
But there are currently no risks in sight, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilizing and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US stocks continue.
Too bad Juncker isn&#39;t studying Klaus!
I am very glad that my friend Michel Barnier has taken on this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, European Commission chief Juncker said when he appointed a French politician (really experienced because he had so many different transnational political functions that we would find it hard to find a better example of the so-called European elite) as the European Commission&#39;s chief negotiator from the EU.
Juncker&#39;s choice brewed signs of hope that it was in the EU&#39;s serious interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most of the British media adopted the name Barnier as Juncker&#39;s act of war.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates Great Britain.
As EU Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He conceived it as only he could conceive it: a hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon conception of the free market and the model of capitalism.
A supporter of multilateral regulation, he co-authored the concept of the so-called banking union and, in spite of everything that came from the City of London&#39;s financial center, enforced legislation on overly harsh financial sector and services regulations.
Thus, this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, adamant and probably ruthless negotiator.
That&#39;s probably not good news.
How not to remember in this context the calm and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
That is why today Czechs and Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this -.
It would be for everyone&#39;s benefit!
The earthquake around Putin?
The ruler of the Kremlin released his loved Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidency on Friday.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
The Russian media reported, referring to the announcement of the Kremlin&#39;s press service.
Putin indicated that he was dismissing Ivanov at his own request.
During a meeting broadcast by the Rossiya 24 television station, the president said that he was responding to Ivanov&#39;s wish when he took office that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The news of the exchange at the head of the president&#39;s administration, which will now be led by Ivanov&#39;s current deputy, Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is described as one of Putin&#39;s closest collaborators.
For example, in the past, this former KGB officer served as Minister of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the chair of a member of the President&#39;s Security Council.
However, Ivanov said during a meeting with Putin that he was actually a record holder for the length of his stay at the head of the administration of the head of state.
He stayed in it for four years and eight months.
In this context, he reminded that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already taken up this position.
Kvitová and deblists Strýcová and Šafářová will not play in the finals.
So far, none of Friday&#39;s tennis matches has managed to turn into a final participation.
Petra Kvitová was the first to lose her fight, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets 4: 4, 6: 1 and 3: 6.
After a while, Kvitová was followed by the Czech deblist players Šafářivá and Strýcová.
Although the Williams sisters&#39; defeats reached for the first set, they wasted two sets and the Russians eventually captured the set in a shortened game.
The second set was then lost by a ratio of 4: 6.
Czech rowing was half a success in the morning program in Rio: skier Ondřej Synek won his semifinals when he defeated the second Damir Martin from Croatia, despite a slowdown at the end, by almost a second.
Good today, conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said Synek.
Unlike him, his opponents had to fight for progress.
So it took away some strength, it could be easier tomorrow.
But I&#39;m not saying that it will be easy, it&#39;s just playing cards for me, said the rower of Prague&#39;s Dukla.
But Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not follow in Snyk&#39;s footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower has finished fourth in her race in today&#39;s semifinals and on Saturday she will start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place.
Gold from London will not be so defended.
For the first time at the Olympics, I did not advance to the finals.
I&#39;m a little sorry, but on the other hand I rode a quality race and I put everything I could into it.
The opponents were simply better, Topinková Knapková bowed in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed that she would be among the elite six in her fourth games.
She gave up the fight just before the finish.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could advance from the field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could advance to the finals via the Austrian.
Unfortunately, there was a life race today, said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio, a young shooter Filip Nepejchal remained, who did not manage to break out of the qualification for the second time, this time with a small shotgun lying down.
In it, Nepejchal took 33rd place.
The qualification went best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky advanced from the first place with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Nepejchal&#39;s shot was 620.5 points.
For the first time, athletes, including Czech heptathletes Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová, also spoke to the program in Rio.
Cachová is the eleventh place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, the Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is the 22nd.
It is led by the British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both took care of the historically best climbing performance in heptathlon.
They still tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who is worse?
Apart from the absurdity of the question posed in this way: German society has undergone deep self-reflection, while Russian society has not.
Dictators emerged in the two great Eurasian nations in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks made a large contribution to the 94 million victims of communism mentioned in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanely wiped out about 6 million Jews, and the total casualties of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
Both the Germans and the Soviets carried out atrocities in the occupied or abandoned territories.
Not only a few individuals were guilty in Germany or the USSR, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or just cowardly or by sticking their heads in the sand.
This is not the specificity of only these nations, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, immediately after the end of the war came denazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they started asking: Daddy, Grandpa, why did you take part in such atrocities?
How could you!
This brought real reflection and healing of society.
Until recently, German elites cared mainly for the country&#39;s prosperity, the eradication of poverty, and the well-being of its citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly do not want to reconnect Alsace-Lorraine or someone - to revenge - to attack militarily - perhaps everyone will recognize that.
After the defeat of the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes finally closed at the turn of the millennium, when a former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin&#39;s Russia is revenge, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and future of one&#39;s own people are of no value to the supreme.
Beat yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only through those decades of the despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from the rise of tensions around the Crimea?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea has deteriorated.
Who benefits from rising tensions?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
The reports from both opposing sides are, of course, contradictory and difficult to verify independently, so we only have the opportunity to think about the old familiar question, who benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there were terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of members of Ukrainian special forces in Russia came from a well-known answer from the case of pilot Savchenko that they were allegedly abducted in Russia.
If we agreed to the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around the Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly on the part of the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and intensification of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, against the background of the immigration crisis in Europe, attention has waned from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already completely lost credit to its people, when the current support of President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine&#39;s economy would have gone bankrupt long ago without the generous financial injections by the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime urgently needs to draw attention to its country again in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to prove themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
We can only hope that all those who are trying to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both sides and stop their hostilities in time.
Bulgaria reported inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous period of 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1, 2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as the previous month.
The US secret services reportedly monitored Russian hacker attacks for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was dealing with an attack on the servers of the Democratic party headquarters.
However, no official report is mentioned on Russia&#39;s involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied involvement in the attack.
The report on the alleged Russian attack was top secret, because its disclosure would reveal that the US secret services are monitoring the hacker attack and could reveal the way they do it and what resources they use.
It is said that two Russian intelligence services took part in the attack.
New Cyber Security Advisory Board
The material on the Russian footprint was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called the Gang of Eight in the United States, were informed.
It consists of the chiefs of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the chairmen of the Democrats in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the congressional defense and security committees.
Democratic Party&#39;s incumbent leader Donna Brazile announced on Thursday that she was setting up a cyber security advisory board to &quot;prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection for the Democratic Party&#39;s servers.&quot;
There was a dangerous parasite in smoked salmon from Alberta.
The string apologized.
Based on the consumer&#39;s suggestion of health problems after consuming food, Wild smoked salmon - pieces of 100 g, expiration date, November 22, 2016, Prague hygienists performed an inspection in the Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Můstku.
The inspection found that batch L23012562 / T4 with the expiry date 22.11.2016, which was pointed out by the customer, is no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch with the expiry date 11.12.2016 was removed.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and human-eaten live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, said Šticha.
We apologize to customers for problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the mentioned batch from sale and for preventive reasons we also withdrew all other batches of this item.
An error occurred on the part of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested ourselves, Albert spokeswoman Barbora Vanko told the News.
If the customer has bought this product, he can return it in any of the chain&#39;s stores and get his money back.
The larvae are destroyed by frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrňata.
Hygienists informed the Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary administrations about the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the bezpecnostpotravin.cz server, people can get anisakiosis after ingesting the parasite, which manifests itself in severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can go asymptomatic, CTK reported.
Symptoms appear one to two weeks after consuming insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually leave the digestive tract spontaneously.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, so they are killed either with sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or when it is frozen.
Veterinarians have currently inspected salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined contained parasites.
According to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS), the consignment with 1,700 products arrived in the Czech Republic at the beginning of April.
The vast majority shipped to the Ahold chain have been 919 packages to date.
Currently, unsold stocks of the product are being withdrawn from stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told ČTK on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately forbade the sending of other products from the warehouse immediately after finding positive samples.
The 17-year-old British wanted to flee Rakka, she was apparently killed by a Russian air raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and quick marriage to the jihadist, who was soon killed, sobriety came.
For the British girls, the expected paradise of the caliphate turned into a hell on earth from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She repeatedly called her to Britain and confided that she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without thinking, The Telegraph quotes the lawyer of the deceased girl&#39;s family, Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks led to Rakka, from there the girl spoke for the last time.
Then came only the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, because the house where she was staying was razed to the ground in May, according to British ITV News.
Television added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane attacking the IS bastion in Syria.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the danger area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) was thinking of fleeing the territory of the Islamic State, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, was publicly beaten to death.
I think (Kadiza) interpreted it as a warning and decided not to take any risks, according to the BBC, Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shami Begum and Amira Abas, set out on 17 February last year.
At home, they just said they were going out.
However, they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey to IS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl&#39;s family did everything in their power to get Kadiza back.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your baby out of the danger area, and this family did everything they could to strain to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without the risk of being caught themselves, the lawyer added.
According to him, the only positive is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
&quot;There are many cases where people have gone there, realized how things are there, understood how different it is from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return,&quot; Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiza&#39;s classmates is unknown.
But because they also fell silent, their families had to accept that they were most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go behind bars without committing a crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray was the county center and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
From the middle of the 18th century, courts were held at the town hall and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts lived were deplorable, and many prisoners tried to escape.
Lots of them even successfully.
Therefore, city officials decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for a long time, its closure took place for economic reasons as early as the end of August 1889, as smaller correctional facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay off much.
Stories of convicts and hunting for ghosts.
The prison opened to the public a century later, and visitors can compare the old building to the new one to see for themselves how different the conditions prevailed.
Guides in period costumes further enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room on display, where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked up in one of the cells, mostly for a souvenir photo, or to evoke the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland&#39;s most famous sites, where it is said to be haunted.
Several groups of hunters of paranormal activities have already set out there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
However, such a night costs 300 pounds, which is roughly 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
The &quot;animé&quot; effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by an animate, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identities in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that seems to stand out from a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved self-plays every day.
Any error will be posted immediately.
Snapchat filters have been criticized in the past for accusing the app of promoting blackfacing or promoting white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it offered users a filter this week to have slanted eyes, crooked teeth, and puffy faces, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - &quot;yellowface.&quot;
And they asked if these repeated controversial issues pointed to a greater problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outrage spread quickly, and Snapchat said the very next day that he had resigned.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a manifestation of accounts with anime characters, not as a cartoon of Asians.
But for observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
The others without packaging refused to compare with the anima.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea, whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was &quot;at least harmful and embarrassing.&quot;
She added that &quot;it is difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is tightened to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate halls to Holywood and the facilities we all carry.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - may mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
&quot;When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to a user,&quot; Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday, &quot;it&#39;s very difficult to go unnoticed today, as it used to be.&quot;
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account on Thursday and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed racially motivated issues reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment.
Katie Zhu criticized the company&#39;s overwhelming white, all-male leadership and ended the article with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
&quot;It&#39;s either that there is no diversity among people and people of color at the time these things are decided,&quot; said Zhu, who is of Sino-American descent, &quot;or people of color work there, but not in positions to they felt safe or comfortable to speak. &quot;
Other observers share her view - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures regarding the diversity of its employees, as it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial background of its employees, but according to the spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on the under-represented population and internal inclusion management.
Zhu adds, &quot;I&#39;m wondering if they really need other users who can say it&#39;s not right,&quot; but said their account will remain terminated.
Army officers have misrepresented intelligence about IS, says a parliamentary committee
A parliamentary committee said in a report issued on Thursday that officers at United States headquarters were changing intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events in the country.
A preliminary report by a Republican chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense found &quot;widespread dissatisfaction&quot; among central intelligence analysts, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of the US effort to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Headquarters, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A press release on the report said: &quot;The intelligence intelligence outputs approved by Centcom&#39;s senior officers usually offered a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism efforts than those confirmed on ground, and were consistently more positive than analyzes obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.&quot;
&quot;What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are harmed when an erroneous analysis is presented to senior policymakers,&quot; said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of Centcom&#39;s management extends to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the persisting problems of the Central Staff in describing and analyzing US efforts to train the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that top officials in the Obama administration have ordered the reports amended, the report said analysts felt they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State. , or IS.
&quot;In the first half of 2015, many of the central staff&#39;s press releases, statements and statements from Congress were significantly more positive than they actually were,&quot; the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq&#39;s second largest city, remains under Islamic state control.
&quot;This is clear after months of investigation,&quot; said Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican party.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top US intelligence staff manipulated staff intelligence output to downplay the dangers of IS in Iraq.
Republicans set up a task force after learning of analysts&#39; concerns that intelligence information about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, must be followed by further investigation.
Another investigation by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense is underway at Centcom&#39;s intelligence services.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the Republican Working Party&#39;s conclusions.
&quot;Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling information on IS and Iraqi security forces,&quot; said Adam B. Schiff, chairman and Democrat.
According to Adam Schiff, the process &quot;led to a distortion of intelligence output,&quot; damaged morality among analysts, and &quot;did not take dissenting views into account.&quot;
However, Schiff and Democrats say they found no evidence that the White House was trying to pressure Centcom analysts to tailor their findings to the &quot;draft or political situation.&quot;
Preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon&#39;s Inspector General, which was launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report because the Inspector General&#39;s investigation was still ongoing.
However, he said that &quot;experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these crucial national security issues.&quot;
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the American-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now proclaimed by a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year&#39;s allegations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can count on the Central Staff to sincerely assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence has reflected conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote research stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the objections of many analysts - was defending a small unit in Iraq and devoted only little time thinking about what will follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic State&#39;s intelligence services.
Authorities announced last year that Hooker&#39;s team had concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, the air strikes against Islamic State refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group&#39;s financial resources as the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not passed on to headquarters.
Centcom Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found the Senate&#39;s testimony too positive a rating of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The USA won the field match in the fourth match in a row, so today the decisive match will be played in the Great Britain team
In the match against Japan, which ended in a 6: 1 victory, Katie Bam scored three goals and just a day later scored the first two goals of the American women&#39;s field hockey team, in which America defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is a success to remember, but Bam (27) said she wasn&#39;t sure if she had ever done such a thing.
&quot;I have no idea,&quot; she said.
I am not one of those who score their goals.
But he knows this: the Americans lead the 4-0 matches at the Olympic tournament and share first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after the 2-0 defeat of Japan.
The UK and the United States will clash on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide which of the group of six teams will finish first and who will finish second.
The team from the first place avoids the strong Danes, who are at the head of the second group, for a little longer.
Whatever the end of Saturday&#39;s match, the Americans caused a stir with their surprising ride, four years after they finished among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was also on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became its youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she did not make it to the final list.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team were very successful.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
&quot;Cultural change, mental change, physical change,&quot; Bam said.
In London, we did not have the pace of work we have today.
We made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bamová started in the first half by scoring a goal with a backend from nearby.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and maintained a score of 1: 0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the field, then looped into the middle and scored the ball into the goal to get the Americans into the lead 2: 0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who helped to score one in each of the three victories, was the first in the tournament.
It is in excellent shape.
Like Bam.
&quot;We&#39;re in a good place now,&quot; Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday&#39;s game.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic frenzy
It doesn&#39;t matter where you are, it doesn&#39;t matter what time it is - it&#39;s the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro show a persistent, indescribable and preoccupied alternation of competitiveness and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay pin passed from an archer to a swimmer, a gymnast and a triathlete.
You can&#39;t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor&#39;s conversation in line at a coffee shop without hearing about Simon Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the animosity between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there&#39;s Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names sound in prime-time homes between commercials and sponsors&#39; spots if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, Calif., Is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumping.
The Olympic flame does not shine in all the same way.
Farther from the center, a bit in the shadows are sports that are not universally recognized: shooting with air pistols, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always succeed in the classic swimming style - and it will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first staged at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, the sport remains almost unnoticed - many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic sport.
It can be regional indifference.
The USA never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012, none of the athletes even made it to the finals.
Prices in the men&#39;s category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the women&#39;s category between China and Canada.
This year, gold medals from London will be awarded to Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But jumping on a trampoline has another bad luck, partly because the uninitiated&#39;s ear will seem more suitable for a clown university than for the Olympics.
I must admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has a comic potential - comic vibrations of endless reflection - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word &quot;trampoline&quot; is derived from the Spanish &quot;el trampoline&quot;, which means &quot;ski jump.&quot;
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them to a height of almost 10 meters and perform sets with several elements (somersaults, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to design, difficulty and &quot;time in the air&quot;.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Gold medal fighters must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
He tries not only to catch up with the finish line or the starting wall, but also, according to television news, another imaginary line: a world or Olympic record.
This unanimous endeavor is classy, admirable, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I also think it&#39;s a bit exhausting when you&#39;re watching the Olympics.
Trampoline jumping brings relief in this regard.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she bounces as if they are weightless as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then effortlessly up again.
It is not possible without competition and, of course, no difficulty, but for the duration of the set there is no fierce struggle to reach the goal, no measuring of distance, but only perfect, graceful suspension of time and gravity.
This is the closest this is when the Olympics and Zen approach.
The women&#39;s qualifiers and finals take place on Friday afternoon, at 1 pm Eastern time, and the men&#39;s competition on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will broadcast the finals as part of the afternoon block, which begins on both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will probably miss over other fights.
And if the focus is only on male athletes looking in love and materializing, as US gymnasts recently suggested by the Wall Street Journal, then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new breathtaking fans.
The &quot;protesting generation&quot; in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been gripped by anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government&#39;s response was ruthless.
Witnesses say police shot and killed hordes of unarmed protesters.
The circulating videos of the protests, which probably date from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show members of the security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand by the wall.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
&quot;It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even harder to take a step forward,&quot; said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa project leader for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
US military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and few, if any, African countries are receiving such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia&#39;s economy has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - human rights organizations are constantly talking about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many were expelled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
However, this may change.
&quot;When you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough,&quot; said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at a university in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
A whole generation is protesting.
There are many complaints, covering everything from land disputes to absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year&#39;s elections, which were widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now control 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing. The conflict along this inaccurately marked, controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
The Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to take advantage of the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, now years of smoldering beneath the surface, these bitter feelings have flared up again.
The first is seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social networks only in the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even if the government denies access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly the case during protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide their location.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oroma and the Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amharis are not natural allies.
For long ages, the Amharas, mostly from the Christian hills of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade and used the Oroma, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that is also changing.
&quot;We are on our way to a unified leadership,&quot; said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oroms.
The biggest protests took place in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amharis and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6 percent of the population and control the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unspecified disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterful in detecting initial signals of dissatisfaction and using envoys to process opponents and win over him.
&quot;The current regime lacks basic knowledge,&quot; said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigraya region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such riots was in 2005, after thousands of people protested what analysts called an election that the government confiscated and then stole.
This was followed by a crackdown, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in previous months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia&#39;s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning such as the new commuter train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked Tigers-owned businesses, and resentment against Tigers on social networks became increasingly common.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a predicament.
The US government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said the base had been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to fall apart in an already volatile area.
&quot;That,&quot; said Abdi, &quot;is a very sharp edge of a blade.&quot;
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and IS funding as &quot;sarcasm&quot;
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to downplay the latest controversy that is flooding his campaign, saying he didn&#39;t mean it when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the &quot;founders&quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate&#39;s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward situation, who vigorously defended him in stormy times, and must explain that he may not have taken his remarks seriously.
Following this proposal at a meeting Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he did not really intend to say that the president and H. Clinton had created the IS.
However, in a Twitter post on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of an old one&#39;s claim just one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his reminder by recalling that Obama was seeking to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate for president did not respond.
The latest storm comes as Trump tries to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in election polls are declining.
Trump and Clinton took part in a duel on economic issues in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this topic.
He warned on Twitter again that Clinton&#39;s proposals were linked to tax increases, and said he said her speech was boring.
Trump had used sarcasm defense before.
At the end of July, when he garnered a wave of criticism, when he suggested that the Russians should break into Clinton&#39;s e-mails, he later explained his remark by saying, &quot;Of course I&#39;m sarcastic.&quot;
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and moderate them as needed.
&quot;I think it&#39;s his way of testing the extent to which some reports have a response from his supporters to see how they react, and then, depending on the reaction, &#39;one way&#39; &#39;explains,&quot; said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language both candidates used.
But I also think that he is deft in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be interpreted differently.
As polls continue to decline in his favor, Trump has taken an even more annoying tone in recent days, instead of moderating things for the general electorate.
A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed that Tump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind Florida.
Trump tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he makes, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faced heightened attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump&#39;s jokes put his devoted followers in an awkward position, who must stand behind him in public, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump&#39;s most prominent supporters, had to extensively defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
&quot;I think what he says is a legitimate political comment,&quot; Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump&#39;s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he mistakenly called a newcomer. And it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed IS to flourish and to manage the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Prior to Friday&#39;s rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to fire a fire on the media on Twitter for breaking his every word and being biased against him.
He laughed at the &quot;poor, pathetic&quot; TV scholars who were trying to understand him, and said, &quot;They can&#39;t do that!&quot;
Several Democrats smirked at Trump&#39;s apology, saying it was just another proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
The cafe was pushed out of the market by prices. He is now returning to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of the growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: &quot;New York is a change, I know, but I still can&#39;t believe the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is looted and Verb is now a soap shop.&quot;
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original staff work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is also still good.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original café, who is also the owner and CEO of the new position.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same pastry supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even used the lighting from the old Verb again.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
Ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings such as capers and fried onions are on offer.
You will also find bowls of brown rice here.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original regulars.
&quot;Many original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg due to prices,&quot; he said.
Last Sunday, there was one such customer, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs. Oliveir, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited Verb Cafe often.
It occurred even after the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
&quot;I&#39;ve found that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb,&quot; she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but that day she took mixed chai, another novelty, instead of her usual iced coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been going to Verb since 2003.
He walks before work and always orders the same thing.
&quot;At a quarter and eight, I come here every day, like a watch, and they prepare my bun with everything and butter for me,&quot; he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he has bacon, eggs, and ham on his bun with everything.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry the soap shop had taken his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and to use filtered coffee from the café as an ingredient.
&quot;I think we could still use it,&quot; Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also welcomed the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish, and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to display it soon to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new place has even more advantages.
A local fruit juice producer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
It is possible to expand the café to a neighboring building.
Many customers only need to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, it was said to have broken his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop reopens, going in and having coffee is like coming home.
&quot;I missed the smell,&quot; he said.
Depressive food from the crisis - in &quot;Square Meal&quot;
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
Gourmet President Roosevelt enjoyed select dishes from 5th Avenue, such as goose liver pate and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: devilish-style eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and plum pudding for dessert.
&quot;It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,&quot; said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: &quot;It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.&quot;
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe&#39;s latest book, &quot;Chop Suey,&quot; was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane, in her book, &quot;97 Orchard,&quot; tells the life story of a house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work &quot;A Square Meal&quot;, published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed culinary solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg&#39;s sandwich shop, a small, austere buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the crisis since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a chopped olive sandwich, Andrew (57) had turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the couple said was great for talking about food during the crisis.
&quot;Meatballs were very popular,&quot; said Miss Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and bean burgers were sold.
They were made from that ingredient and other cheap food that set the ingredient.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grinned.
&quot;They would lie in your stomach like lead,&quot; he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served as a buffet to eat what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers, and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. &quot;A Square Meal&quot; looks at the ways in which the nation has come to terms with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
&quot;It was a time when food became a focal point for the American people,&quot; Coe said, explaining why he and his wife had decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious dishes, such as meatballs and pots, spread as a &quot;wonderful way to use leftovers,&quot; Ziegelman remarked as chefs could hide unaesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the focal point of American food - has become an economically allocated luxury.
Strange blends, which were to serve as a caloric and nutritional filler, took precedence over taste or even common sense in cooking.
During surveys for the recipe book, Miss Ziegelman prepared a period meal of roasted onions stuffed with peanut butter.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t a favorite addition to the evening table,&quot; Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman emphasized, &quot;It was surreal.&quot;
Peanut butter and roasted onions do not go together.
It was typical of a lot of homemade recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of the Home Economy from 1923 to 1943 - controlled the country&#39;s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take the reins of the budget, and turned sizing, such as creamy spaghetti with carrots, into delicious food.
The book &quot;A Square Meal&quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies.
Above all, the cakes arose in the government&#39;s response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover&#39;s &quot;I&#39;ll have a cake&quot; pose.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm cuisine of his childhood, he dined as the chosen millionaire he had become.
&quot;He enjoyed eating continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumber sauce,&quot; Andrew Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not made him lead by example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in taste at all. As a result, the White House was &quot;not only served almost the most gloomy meal in all of Washington, but also prepared in the most unhappy way.&quot;
Many of the eating habits of the crisis faded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy remained in our constant study of calories and nutritional values, says Miss Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple says that while writing the book, they better understood Ms. Ziegelman&#39;s mother&#39;s eating habits - for example, why she couldn&#39;t throw away food.
&quot;She was really afraid of wasting food,&quot; Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman reminded, &quot;She was sick of her.&quot;
There was an accident with the profiteroles.
When Eisenberg&#39;s tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
&quot;It&#39;s called plum cream,&quot; Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Each reluctantly plunged the spoon into a thick brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a good housekeeper, he said to his wife, &quot;A little chopped walnuts would be useful.&quot;
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most refugees who roll into Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the series would look like if we shot it.
A group of Russian artists who call themselves 2D Among Us are making fun of their homeland.
Using photoshop, he creates collages that humorously show what it would be like if famous series and movies were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to legal expenses in the case of a patent against hepatitis C against the Merck Group
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbursement of attorneys&#39; fees incurred in the C-hepatitis C patent lawsuit against drug manufacturer Merck &amp; Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was ordered to pay $ 200 million in damages for infringement of two Merck patents in connection with Gilead&#39;s highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge found repeated illegal actions by Merck, among others. lie under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a file on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for next-generation C-jaundice drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with the disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming to own basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead&#39;s drugs.
American-backed military forces say they have gained full control of the city of Manbij
US-backed troops have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now combing the city after the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city left.
Troops have freed more than 2,000 civilians detained by radicals, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF and Manbij&#39;s military council told Reuters.
&quot;The city is now under our full control, but we are still searching it,&quot; he told Reuters.
The Clinton earned $ 10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which states that the presidential candidate for the Democrats and her husband had revenues of $ 10.75 million that year and paid an actual tax of 34.2 percent.
The Clinton donated $ 1 million to charity in 2015, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $ 5.3 million in lectures to the joint coffers, and the former Secretary of State acknowledged $ 3 million in revenue from Simon &amp; Schuster for her book on her work in the State Department.
The Clinton co-candidate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton have published 10-year tax returns.
In 2015, they paid an actual tax of 20.3 percent.
&quot;Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model of financial transparency,&quot; said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, hides behind false excuses and backs away from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit by the U.S. Treasury Department&#39;s tax department as the reason for his refusal to disclose tax returns.
&quot;Your move,&quot; Hillary Clinton, a campaign aide, said on Twitter, following up on the Democratic candidate&#39;s tax returns.
Michael Cohen, Trump&#39;s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to file tax returns until the audits were complete.
According to Trump&#39;s critics, including Republican presidential candidate 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, his refusal raises questions about his net profits, charitable contributions, business transactions and various other relations, including with Russia. .
Clinton speaks strongly on the issue and released a video on Friday recalling how high Republicans are urging Trump to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, he will mention the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
&quot;She refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades - to publish their tax returns,&quot; she told people.
Politico said Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants as saying that this may be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the presidential election.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett, which would ensure that everyone who earns more than $ 1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, home to Buffet&#39;s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway.
Buffett said he also passed an IRS audit and that Trump was not &quot;afraid&quot; of the tax office, but of voters.
Clinton&#39;s campaign published tax returns back to 2007.
Clinton, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average of 32 percent federal tax and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clinton tax return for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, their wages are as little as $ 100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported dividends and interest income of $ 109,000.

Condoms filled with chillies or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox method to prevent elephants from entering human dwellings by throwing condoms filled with chili powder on them.
This practice has proved its worth, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this practice and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to protect their homes and crops in four steps using this nonviolent approach. without harming the animals.
Many of them used to use spears in their defense.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
&quot;Since they developed this ... set of tools, we have seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them, &quot;said Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
The first and second steps are to illuminate the passing elephant with a flashlight and start the horn.
If this does not discourage him, the so-called &quot;chilli cloud&quot; will be thrown out.
The chili powder mixed with salt is wrapped in a condom together with the firecracker, the end of which is knotted so that only the wick looks out of it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine chili powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually one gust is enough and the elephant will go in another direction.
The last option is to set off fireworks, which will cause a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director leans against Berlin hotel for removing code for calling to Israel at Arab&#39;s &quot;request&quot; - RT News
A French film director of Jewish descent caused a stir in the media after finding out that the Kempinski Hotel Bristol in Berlin did not have a code to call Israel, according to the employee at the &quot;request&quot; of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary about the Holocaust &quot;Shoah&quot;, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Hotel Bristol in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in a list of codes for calling at a hotel.
However, the state was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016, Israel was removed and erased in Berlin, the capital of Germany?
Written by Lanzmann.
Kempinski Hotel Bristol instead offers the possibility to call Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with a problem.
According to him, the answer he received &quot;shocked&quot; Lanzmann.
A hotel employee replied that the measure was &quot;decided at the discretion of Kempinski Hotels&#39; management.&quot;
The reason for this step angered the director even more.
&quot;Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the Israeli calling code be deleted,&quot; Lanzmann quoted the employee in a letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel&#39;s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a &quot;great disgrace.&quot;
We were horrified and shocked by the event.
That in itself is a huge disgrace.
The fact that something like this has happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain is an even greater shame.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, &quot;he said.
The event provoked a strong online response, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel was simply &quot;lost&quot; in the demands of Arab customers.
&quot;Shame on you,&quot; says another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the classy Kurfurstendamm, is close to the synagogue.
According to the daily Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dismissed any allegations by calling the event &quot;overlooked&quot; and &quot;apologizing&quot; to Lanzman.
&quot;There has never been a direct order&quot; not to include Israel in the list of codes for calls, according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, a representative of the Kempinski hotel.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
A clash between students and police took place in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday as students gathered to demonstrate against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement services tried to disperse the students, which resulted in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students to express their concerns about the plans.
San Paulo Governor Gerald Alckmin&#39;s proposals to save money include closing nearly 100 public schools and relocating 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration could be seen spraying signs on the wall against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff, when the country&#39;s senate decided to charge her.
Trade between Russia and Iran grew by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
As the ambassador said, since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, &quot;said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $ 856 million.
Specifically, Russia&#39;s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $ 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The jump in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, &quot;said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of tourists from Iran to visit Russia this year.
Last year, a Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued around 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran is among the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran to Russia from last year will be surpassed, &quot;he said.
At the same time, however, a relatively small number of Russians visit Iran. The ambassador hopes for a change.
&quot;I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,&quot; he said.
Cattle Callum Skinner rushes home after the British win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in the men&#39;s team sprint at the Rio velodrome as the UK trio defended their London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of a brake taken by Sir Chris Hoy as his Scot, and the young man was delighted by the legend when he rushed to the finish line and stole the victory at the hands of favored New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago, and Hoy won fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the specialized introductory racer Jamie Staff.
So Hindes appeared just in time.
Koy Emadi and Matt Crampton also tried to fill a place after Hoy&#39;s departure.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was with Hoy the champion four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic qualifying record, but the jersey was taken over by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, as Hindes went on a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep up.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes stepped on the podium, he did not take his eyes off them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: &quot;It&#39;s a flattering comparison.&quot;
I&#39;m here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win it.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew the remark and Britain&#39;s rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
There was no such problem around this victory this time.
Hindes said, &quot;With all those British flags in the stands, I felt like I was in London.&quot;
In the last three months, we have all come together as a team.
We have lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a successful five days await us at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny showed, it is inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy&#39;s success and win three gold medals at the same time in one Olympics.
That would be the birthday of March 23 for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy on the day (this date seems sacred to British sport, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also celebrate birthdays on this day) - meant a total of six gold and one silver medal.
As much as Hoy got.
Next, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will last for another three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, &quot;I&#39;m enjoying this one now.
A team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, &quot;If he wins two more gold medals, he should receive a knighthood.&quot;
It was the only medal race of the day, but there was more good news ahead of Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the four-kilometer team race.
They finished with a time of 3: 51.943.
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3: 51.659.
The first round and the final (22:42) take place on today&#39;s second day of the race, which Wiggins will certainly focus on.
He debated with the commissioners yesterday before the qualifying race, when the judges invited him to measure his height.
In a similar women&#39;s race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a world record with a time of 4: 13.260.
Team VB relied on its strong track cycling team and dominated the middle season of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, proving absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations fell during the preparations for Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of CTO Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of careers for greats such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the velodrome races, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
The uncertain future of the Portland smelter following the termination of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain due to the power plant, which supplies the company with electricity and which announced the intention of one of the smelter&#39;s owners to terminate the electricity supply contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
The move comes after the Victoria government decided earlier this year not to extend the subsidies that keep the business going.
The fixed twenty-year subsidy will expire in November.
At Alcoa Portland, up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk.
Up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk if closed.
And because the smelter consumes about 10 percent of Victoria&#39;s total electricity produced, there may be further avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa&#39;s Portland plant is downstairs and threatens to close.
The move follows several years of speculation about the company&#39;s future, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to plant production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity to the large aluminum smelter from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, small business shares are held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
&quot;AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, the strong demand for electricity from the smelter will continue,&quot; she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts are so-called &quot;reinsurance contracts&quot;, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
&quot;The AGL continues to anticipate that the contracts will share in the profit for fiscal year 2017,&quot; the power plant said.
Any potential impact on the AGL&#39;s profits from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it had already written $ 187 million worth of contracts under its books &quot;in the event of termination.&quot;
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract &quot;does not affect its ... ability to operate the smelter or secure the supply of electricity to the smelter.&quot;
The American company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was to take effect in November this year, although it has yet to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the industry.
AGL operations manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland was consuming about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both companies withdrew from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer, &quot;he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian real estate TV show - he is now the cover of September&#39;s Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and fourth daughter of the mother-clan manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the cover of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the ambassador of the Estee Lauder brand, which showed at the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
&quot;In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page,&quot; Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply continuation of Kardashian humor?) Staged video featuring the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar rioters Rob and Caitly, along with everyone&#39;s favorite show business uncle, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). They forgot about their sister&#39;s cover, just so that the scene could end in a classic twist: they are preparing a secret party.
It&#39;s a well-drawn storyline in almost every &quot;birthday&quot; episode of a children&#39;s television show (Seacrest says, &quot;Did you think we forgot about you?&quot; With the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o&#39;clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure the other girls could feed on this publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue, we have definitely entered a new era of the Kardashians.
Older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
The edition, which is more reminiscent of a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that out of 832 pages in last year&#39;s edition, 615 pages were with advertising content).
The unveiling of the star, which will appear on the front page, is eagerly awaited, so it is no wonder that in the past two years, the magazine&#39;s images have leaked before its official publication.
Women who have appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, more &quot;celebrities who make models&quot; have appeared on the front page than &quot;models who are celebrities.&quot;
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar winner and ambassador for the Dior brand, appeared on the headline in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Laga Gaga.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall - whom the magazine describes as a &quot;breakthrough model&quot; of her generation - will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of celebrities, or the stars of real estate shows, or the children of today who know how to make a well-edited video (although Jenner presents all this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, which appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner&#39;s success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult due to her participation in reality shows.
Stephanie Seymor, the original model of Victoria&#39;s Secret, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June, calling them &quot;whores of the moment.&quot;
These feelings flared up again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September&#39;s Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He performs for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of her daughter Cindy Crawford, whom she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she acts on a reality show, perhaps only as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community legal aid centers reject 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in community legal aid centers, and in the sector itself they are preparing for the effects that further funding will have on already overburdened services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without the financial means to fight unfair evictions and the like - are rejected when they seek free legal aid and representation. .
Community legal services, which are already so strained to bursting, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of community legal aid centers in Queenslad, said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers, five thousand people were rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said the situation would worsen without the federal government&#39;s decision being overturned.
&quot;Community legal aid centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,&quot; he said.
People who have escaped from a relationship with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families in separation, workers who are being unfairly dismissed - all of these people have problems with the legal dimension, and this report shows that they do not have a chance to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which will mean that thousands more vulnerable people in Queensland will have to navigate complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on Queensland&#39;s Attorney and Senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this cut in funding so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
Last year, the state government met its commitment to provide funding for legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and the community of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
A lawsuit against Donald Trump&#39;s campaign after a staff member allegedly aimed his weapon
New York: Donald Trump&#39;s campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after being told that the North Carolina operations director aimed a gun at a staff member while driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a court file handed over to Vincent Bordini, a former software campaign trainer in the state, on Wednesday at the state court in Charlotte.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that &quot;it will not.&quot;
Director Earl Phillip &quot;pointed his pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and aimed the barrel at Vincent&#39;s cup,&quot; Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The file states that Bordini found out after a complaint to the local and regional campaign management that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
&quot;Weapons do not have to fire to cause damage,&quot; Bordini said in a lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate provoked a stir when he told North Carolina voters that owners and holders of arms (as regulated in the Second Amendment to the US) could intervene if his rival, Hillary Clinton, is elected, and will be able to appoint its judges.
Trump&#39;s campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump&#39;s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the report with a request for comment.
Attempts to obtain a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local intelligence agency in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one answered the phone to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services in a short time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is leading a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London 2012 was, when we made a special effort to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics have brought huge benefits to both Startford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and our local unemployment around the airport alone for our local communities.
As before the London Olympics in 2012, there will be those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too great.
I have been told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympics and that we will be ridiculed on the world stage.
Doubters were wrong in 2012, and even in the case of Heathrow, they turn out to be wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and businesses, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £ 211 billion, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has set up a £ 11bn infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, from Terminal T5 - which has been voted the best terminal in the world five years in a row - to Terminal T2, which was built between the two busiest runways. in the world.
They are now ready to deliver a third runway worth £ 16 billion in private investment.
The London Games in 2012 were a huge success for the UK, and I am convinced that Heathrow will be an expansion.
It is time to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure future trade and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Minister of Commerce of the Treasury.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the game of cat and mouse in ad blocking
Attempts to circumvent advertising-blocking programs have become a game for cats and mice for online marketing companies. At least that&#39;s what one of the companies that programs such software claims.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site stating that users could update filters in their program and re-block ads on their desktop sites. this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website would change the encoding around the ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to determine which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already been bypassed.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that &quot;this kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those trying to circumvent it has lasted since ad blocking was invented,&quot; and that Facebook is likely to come up with another own repair.
The fact that the company with the world&#39;s largest social network has joined the war only proves how big of a problem ad-blocking has become for industry.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair last year, Adobe uses ad filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times as many as in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook advertising profits, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
However, the spokesman said that the company is going against desktop advertising filters because mobile advertising filters for mobile applications for the social network and Instagram do not work.
Desktop ads are still high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it will update the &quot;ad preferences&quot; tool to give people more control over how their ads appear.
On Thursday, Facebook said they were concerned about Adblock&#39;s new filters, as they could also block non-advertising content on the site.
&quot;It&#39;s not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,&quot; a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail statement.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, so we&#39;ve focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
The woman was hit by a car on the Swiss highway
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking to witness an incident in which a woman who probably tried to commit suicide was run over several cars on the highway on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actress of the &quot;desperate act&quot; was lying in the dark on the road and was run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but police have not all identified them. Police are calling on these drivers and all others who have witnessed the accident to report.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a &quot;logical&quot; step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
The plaintiff must find out this, &quot;said Hofstetter.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years, it seems that drivers will not be held liable.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian to cross the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent killings after she knocked down and killed a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court said that the victim, at the age of 22, drank alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who had responded to the emergency call - had acted reasonably and that the man&#39;s presence on the road was &quot;a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,&quot; the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday&#39;s incident near Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (AČCKA) expects that up to 20,000 visitors will come to Prague as part of Prague Pride.
Kateřina Petříčková, Executive Director of AČCKA, announced this on Friday.
The sixth year of Prague Pride started on August 8, the festival brings closer the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people took part in the event.
&quot;Prague is one of the most popular destinations in the LGBT community, due to the high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized companies,&quot; said Petříčková.
According to a survey of the organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of 3,100 crowns per person per day.
To support their travel, gay tourists have access to special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague&#39;s gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
&quot;For tourism in general, LGBT clients are very lucrative, they are interested in staying at higher prices with a high standard of travel services and spend more than others,&quot; said Petříčková.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is taking place this year as part of the festival program.
Experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China give lectures at it.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also address several thematic areas, such as the family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival on Saturday will be the traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
The parade, which has been attended by thousands of people in recent years, will pay a minute&#39;s silence to the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate forty years.
The irreplaceable do-it-yourselfers Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertaining small and large viewers for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series by director Lubomír Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries around the world, were cartoon jokes by artist and director Lubomír Beneš, which he invented for a magazine with two do-it-yourselfers, Mr. Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the playwright Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimír Jiránek to collaborate and together they created the film Kuťáci.
The characters got their current form with a yellow and red trick and a beanie and a radio in 1979, when a series for Slovak Television began to appear in Krátký film Praha.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the DIYers in 1985, this time it was shot directly for Krátký film Praha.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own animated film studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of which were attended by Beneš&#39;s son Marek.
At present, there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these do-it-yourselfers, who pour everything in their hands, but never get angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and do-it-yourself enthusiasm, and it is done!&quot;.
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and the theater, and characters and other toys depicting Pat and Mat are a hit at every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is marked by fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sports and one from life.
They both have a good ending.
So let&#39;s take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
And what things do people spend the most at airports?
This is Friday&#39;s survey of the world&#39;s websites.
The first medal from the Olympic Games.
The island state of Fiji is celebrating historic success.
The rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the British team in the final of the Seven Rugby Olympics.
This is the first medal that Fiji has won for itself at the Olympics.
It took sixty years from the first expedition to the Olympic Games to wait for the first precious metal.
Coach Fiji has a lot to do with the success.
However, it is ironic that it is Brit Ben Ryan.
He has been leading the team since 2013 and after the finals, as a British citizen, he could be satisfied, unlike his compatriots.
&quot;Let&#39;s play freely and easily and see if we can handle the biggest match in our history,&quot; the coach said before the final.
Fiji eventually took control of it, and a small country of 900,000 people is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
The news was brought by the French daily Le Monde.
New friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without arms and legs since she was 11 months old.
A doll that looks like her.
&quot;Mom, she&#39;s like me,&quot; the two-year-old girl rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her arms and legs and then sits together without prostheses.
Harmony was diagnosed with meningitis type B in less than a year of her life, and doctors gave her only a ten percent chance of survival.
There&#39;s nothing I wouldn&#39;t love about her.
She is beautiful, smart, funny and never gives up.
It also has an overview.
I saw her introducing herself to the other children with the words Hello, I&#39;m Harmony and I don&#39;t have hands, the mother added.
See how happy the doll was.
What do we spend at the airport for as much as possible?
CNN finds that people at airports spend the most on bottled water.
Hudson&#39;s travel essential stores have released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products most customers buy in their airport stores.
The water was masterfully the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
The ninth place was taken by a large package of M&amp;M candies with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who closes the top ten?
You can&#39;t eat as the only one of the above.
According to CNN, it is The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Rowing sovereigns.
We&#39;re just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
Rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have sovereignly ruled the category of doubles without the helmsman for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the disparate pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and have been crushing the competition since 2009.
In the lagoon of Rodrigo de Freitas, they scored their 69th victory in a row in Thursday&#39;s final.
How are we different from others?
We&#39;re just nicer, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta when he had to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Honestly, we do nothing different from others.
We just train hard, very hard.
And we&#39;re constantly trying to improve our technique, that&#39;s our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is also remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is almost a two-meter and 100-kiloch firefighter, the academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
In addition, they are of a different nature.
Bond studies and specializes in finance, Murray has a charity boxing match, for example.
That&#39;s why they don&#39;t spend much time together outside rowing.
Eric basically gets on the ship with the understanding that we can&#39;t lose.
We&#39;re just going to win.
I tend to think about what could go wrong, Bond admitted, demonstrating at a press conference that Murray was dominant in the crew.
He always answered first, and Bond waited for his chance.
On the water, however, it destroys opponents with calm force.
They are going at their own pace, and although they are often not yet in the middle of the track, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to drive the first kilometer.
We&#39;re just trying to set a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 37-year-old Murray.
With his partner four years younger, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when both members of the Golden Four were without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to switch to number two without the helmsman.
At the Olympics in London, they probably made up for the biggest defeat of their career and confirmed their dominance in Rio as well.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us and didn&#39;t ask anything.
It was a little more fun this time.
We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well, Murray said.
We know that they all want to overthrow us.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we try to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to projections by NASA&#39;s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA&#39;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, free of water and saturated with CO2, conditions similar to those on Earth could exist.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rotational speed of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, it seems that Venus may once have boasted a sparse Earth-like atmosphere while rotating slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planets were probably drier on Earth than on Earth, but there used to be enough water and geographic diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to also use the Sun, which was 30 percent thicker.
&quot;In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus exposes its diurnal side to the sun for almost two months at a time during slow rotation,&quot; explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This heats the surface and creates rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that act like an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than at present on Earth.
The model compiled a story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past - over several billion years - it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapor was burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen escaped, leaving only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of a greenhouse gas - this is Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche&#39;s hockey operations on Thursday, citing the inability to participate in the team&#39;s decision-making process.
Colorado Executive Vice President / General Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
&quot;For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,&quot; 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
During the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needed, and take it to the next level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and vice president of hockey operations are in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that affect the team&#39;s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
&quot;Patrick informed me of his decision today,&quot; Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league&#39;s best coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division. But Colorado battled Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, and over the past two years, he has not always struggled after the season.
The Avalanche team scored 39: 39: 4 in the 2015/2016 season and lacked five points to win their second wild card in the Western conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who has entered the Hall of Fame, has won the Stanley Cup four times - twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers on an oil rig in the North Sea are resuming talks and interrupting the strike
The leaders of the negotiating parties said that the strikes over wages for oil rig workers in the North Sea were suspended while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against Wood Group&#39;s oilfield services company sporadically took place on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
&quot;Wood Group and the unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve the current disagreements,&quot; the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is to protest wage cuts by up to 30 percent.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for offshore companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would give companies room to cope with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell removed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to modernize its processes - immediately following a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain&#39;s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Earlier this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes in a generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region&#39;s economy.
&quot;In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some,&quot; he said in a statement.
By comparison, in 2016, nearly $ 1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years has been around $ 7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the rotational speeds of stars from the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster are spinning at different speeds, as well as how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
&quot;We hope to compare our results with other clusters to learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age and even the history of its solar system,&quot; said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech&#39;s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have formed over 125 million years ago.
It now rotates the fastest.
At moments of maximum rotation speeds, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, so does its rotational speed.
Kepler measures the speed of each star&#39;s rotation by measuring the time between the appearance of recognizable points on the stars - similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull likens stars to dancers, larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
&quot;In the Pleiades &#39;ballet,&#39; we see that slower-spinning stars are more massive, while those that spin the fastest are usually very light stars,&quot; Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star quality and rotational speeds.
&quot;The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, for younger and older stars,&quot; Rebull said.
There is still a lot to learn about how, when and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation and, so to speak, &quot;hang their dance shoes on a clove.&quot;
Rebullová and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the Pleiadian rotational speeds in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not apply, then would the qualification agreement not be concluded and I could move to another hospital after a few months?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without enrolling in specialized education?
The point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a slightly more distant hospital, but in about half a year a vacancy could be made available in another, where I would then like to work.
So I don&#39;t know how to deal with the situation in about six months, the question continues.
Responsible Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legal regulation stipulates the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
The qualification agreement is a legal institute regulated by the Labor Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the return of the costs associated with increasing or deepening the employee&#39;s qualification.
In the field of healthcare, there is long-term pressure not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the job mobility of healthcare professionals, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
Pursuant to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., On the conditions for acquiring and recognizing professional competence and specialized competence to perform the medical profession of doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is explicitly true that participation in specialized education is considered to deepen qualifications (not to increase it). ).
This means that, according to the Labor Code, a qualification agreement can be concluded only if the costs amount to at least CZK 75,000.
No legal regulation even stipulates the obligation to enroll in specialized education.
The law only stipulates the conditions of the application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to practice the profession of a doctor already by completing the necessary university studies, even under the conditions stipulated by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized qualifications in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which the professional education of a doctor may include professional practice completed in another field of specialization, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
Theoretically, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the interviewer&#39;s situation.
However, given that I do not know the details of this case, it is recommended to consult with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions), as the Ministry of Health provides legal and advisory services related to inclusion in specialization and its course.
The counseling service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from Halab, Syria, are asking for US intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (rebel parts of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to enforce civilian protection, the AFP quoted the White House as saying.
&quot;We do not need tears, compassion, or even prayer; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again,&quot; doctors said.
Russian forces, which support an army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab area every day for three hours from today, to allow humanitarian convoys to pass safely.
All military activities, air strikes and artillery fire are to be stopped from 9:00 to 12:00 CET.
UN chief of humanitarian operations Stephen O&#39;Brien welcomed this, but stressed the need for a truce of at least two days.
According to the AFP, 15 out of 35 doctors operating in the eastern part of Halab, already controlled by rebels, turned to Obama in the letter.
They write that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel death of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and saying how complicated Syria is, but it is doing little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate the population from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like slightly veiled threats, said pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria were recorded in the past month, including 15 on the hospitals in which they work.
We are most saddened by the fact that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Young children come to the emergency room with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don&#39;t even have the necessary material to help them, doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion cut off oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They gasped and then their lives ended - before he could really begin, they reminded themselves.
An army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded insurgent-controlled eastern Halab in recent weeks, with more than 200,000 people inside without food supplies.
The rebels, who are under the constant blows of the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break through the siege and launch a counter-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then added reinforcements in and around the city.
