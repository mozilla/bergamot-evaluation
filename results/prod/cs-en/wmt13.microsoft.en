The Republican Party's Strategy Against Obama's Re-Election
Republican leaders justified their policies by essentially fighting voter fraud.
But the Brennan Center calls such fraud a myth, saying that voter fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
Indeed, Republican advocates have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud in the US in the last decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine america's democratic system.
Unlike Canada, individual states in the US are responsible for organizing federal elections.
And in that vein, most US governments since 2009 have been pro-election new laws that make it difficult to vote or register.
This phenomenon boomed after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting voting rights were introduced in 41 states in 2011 alone.
New election laws require voters to present photo ID and U.S. citizenship documents.
Moreover, these laws limit the period of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the elections, and take away the right to vote away from citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 election, no American state required voters to present proof of photo id.
Indiana was the first state to introduce this requirement.
The constitutionality of indiana law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to extend the procedure to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported such bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo IDs.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not own any photo ID issued by their state government office.
Furthermore, about five million new voters do not have such an ID card in 2012.
In addition, it often costs more than $100 to get the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
25% African-Americans, 15% of people with incomes under $35,000; Therefore, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters known for their leanings towards Democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote for Republican candidates to use the cards issued by those clubs during elections.
Until 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for elections.
Arizona introduced the first such requirement.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have passed laws that oblige voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes cast by the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican legislators supported laws in eight states that repeal voter registration on election day.
In addition, they have restricted the right of people and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million people.
However, measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% decrease in new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the early election period.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans made up 33% of the electorate who voted ahead, even though there were only 13% of African-American voters in that state.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They made up only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of the electorate who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed passing laws that restrict voter registration.
Democratic governors blocked several bills with their vet.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
In part, they managed to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules will make it undeniably more difficult to exercise voting rights in 2012.
Democratic critics speak primarily of the bias of the laws passed, viewing them as an apparent effort to influence the outcome of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 brennan center report shows that the states where these laws were passed account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is already certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine america's democratic system.
Prostate cancer detection: have an examination or not?
The PSA test often yielded erroneous results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this increased the hesitation of men who were already reluctant to go for examination at all.
Get checked out or not?
We asked two experts for their opinion.
Studies conducted in the USA have shown high levels of contamination between the different groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate between patients who underwent examinations and those who did not.
This study also showed after a 12-year gap that those who do not go for the examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastases.
So I recommend an examination from the age of 50 or from 40 years if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also a more vulnerable group.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species that are indifferent.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the level of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus in these cases more on active disease surveillance.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
Rather, we will suggest them to carry out active surveillance and offer them treatment in case of disease progression.
Increasingly and with greater accuracy, we set criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not to treat.
Nevertheless, I recommend that you undergo the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urological Society, movember has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and against in connection with psa examinations.

Prevention of diseases
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous procedure for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting healthy lifestyle principles seems to be the best way to reduce disease risks.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthily and moved sufficiently, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If everyone stopped smoking, that figure would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society.
By contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer causes heredity.
Some percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers decreases.
Cigarettes are responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging figure: 10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
weight
Body health and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, anesthrm, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
If consumed too high, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is advisable to avoid sausages for which the same applies.
The preservation of meat by feeding, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet drawn clear conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
Although one of them says that the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, another study speaks more of an increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not unequivocally proven.
Mr Beaulieu goes on to insist on the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and precedents.
"Undergoing an examination doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in a mechanism that is responsible for all matter in the universe.
Furthermore, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "least wrong" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty among physicists that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the Kyoto Grand Physical Congress rather confirms it, but all the data is still missing in order to be absolutely sure.
However, suppose it's the Higgs boson, since the risks of error seem small, and let's look at what's going on.
In this world, there is an unquestionable law according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
You can't get around this rule - and don't try too hard, otherwise you'll get hurt.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: pauli's exclusionary principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly creates some of their properties.
It also divides physics particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, obediently adhering to the Pauli principle.
And at the other end there are bosons, mean anarchists who value nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (absolutely amazing, by the way), the Particle Adventure, in berkeley laboratories: the mesons that we leave unnoticed here, and the "force particles" through which large forces of nature spread, and with which the Higgs boson is probably related in some way.
It must be said, however, that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might think.
If you read this article, it is due to a boson with unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
When particles with an electric charge accelerate or change their course, they "disturb" the electromagnetic field at this particular location, similar to a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "interruption" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) arises, and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, "carriers of power".
More stable field
It's also with the Higgs boson, only that a different field, the Higgs field, needs to be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than an electromagnetic field; to excitate it, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, similar to the frozen surface of the pond, which is only spring up a very large boulder.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as the accelerator in cern laboratory - the large hadron collider with accommodating bundles is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again useful to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Not all particles or all materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - for example, a piece of paper will never hold by itself on the refrigerator.
And yet, with the Higgs field, not all particles react: those that do have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let's look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what is all this research for, what will they "bring us"?
From a scientific point of view, this is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to investigate any mismatch between observations and predictions of SM.
Moreover, few physicists literally want them to be found, because the slightest difference could open up space for "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge shortcomings, it does not bring any clarification of gravity (oh!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of space matter (oh!).
However, CERN has not yet discovered such discrepancies.
repercussions
The responses of these researches in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Novak are very difficult to predict, but the mistake would be to assume that there will be none.
Behold: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in Bell's laboratories had no idea of the revolution their work would bring about.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a "lab toy".
Just imagine...
In addition, the application can also result from all the tools surrounding research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle didn't plan it at first, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, that doesn't mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... | Le Devoir
Through its Dignified Dying Commission, Quebec has recently engaged in a delicate end-of-life issue.
The debate should soon continue, and at the same time a bill is being drafted.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégia.
The prostate cancer that consumed him gave him a two-year reprieve.
"They gave me five years to live, and it's been seven years," he says emotionlessly in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its job: immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone or just eating himself.
He looks resignedly at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He's brave and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop by, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage to ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humiliates me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"All your life, you learn that men urinate standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at victor-gadbois.
Returning to the child phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the person" whether to accept the return, the psychologist says.
In the opinion of many palliative care people, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is no more than three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who take care of them does not provide them with so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "of asuffs in full consciousness."
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in my life anymore," she says, and then she's going to let us put her on a breathing apparatus.
Nevertheless, he is still looking forward to his son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
At victor-gadbois, in cooperation with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like, which comes into being if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one palliative care bed per 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize we're all going to die someday.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, a taste of brandy or pepsi can be provided.
Diabetics no longer have to monitor their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night they were carrying beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son finishes his beer in honor of his late father.
"We help patients as much as their loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In victor-gadbois' home, days go by, but they don't resemble each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man rejoicing in his last meeting with his family, thoroughly laid out on pillows while they toast him in his honour, a 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, dies tragically after trying every opportunity to survive.
"For six months there have always been three to five beds for people with cancer under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel with concern.
53% of patients who come to victor-gadbois home come from their homes, 47% come from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
They say that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is designed to alleviate suffering once the sick person reaches the final stage of their lives, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as victor-gadbois home and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental unavailability of health care in Quebec that has led many palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by leaders in palliative care, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all people have access to quality palliative care before euthanasia can be agreed.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the E.R. in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He is concerned that patients should not ask for death because they are not getting appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncology doctor that I was quitting treatment, she replied that she regretted stopping fighting, she tells us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their attending physicians for not fulfilling their wishes when the palliative cunt team relieved their pain.
It must be said, however, that palliative care is certainly not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montreal-area Home Palliative Care Society, patients resist pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives that put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether by impact or whether the sedative is given permanently.
We cannot pretend not to notice this part of the suffering.
A patient who is not relieved of pain will increasingly have access to palliative sedatives.
Patients who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: "I want to die".
However, this does not necessarily mean 'I want you to euthanasia me', it means 'I want you to relieve me of my pain'.
This report was made possible by a grant to journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Travel officials, construction and public works entrepreneurs, political party lobbyists, and Italian mafia experts are still telling what they know about an amazing "system" that mixes construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mobsters.
This "field" cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how the system has crumbled since we took major measures," jacques duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former montreal police chief, says ironically.
It caused a scandal in 2011 following a rigorous investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with Quebec's road construction contracts, which then-Liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved only after lengthy delays.
The "Duchesneau report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party funding and the corruption of civil servants.
"Ever since the investigation began in 2010," he says, "only the Department of Transportation has saved $1 billion in contracts," with some people keeping their instincts to get a share of them at bay!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already led to the resignation of two mayors," he adds, hoping to "uneark the guile of some people."
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also engaged in combat with its army of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
On top of that, the "Marteau Retinue" police officers, who since 2009 have ensured that Montreal's "money-laundering cartel" significantly eases the inflating of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a series of searches and charged a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban community, with fraud and corruption.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just stepped down as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Montreal transport engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian descent, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have also received formal charges.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
During those years, he donated 3% of the value of the contracts he won in Montreal to a mafia-related middleman who then transferred the money to the Union Montreal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000, donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also pleaded guilty to organizing an illegal fundraising spree for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money-laundering companies whose prices he exaggerated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transportation engineer, described him in great detail before the commission: within 10 years, he had received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games, and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with money utilities for which he had exaggerated the price.
Other public officials in the transportation sector admitted that they were paid fees for overestimate invoices by 30% to 40% through false multiple work.
Martin Dumont, the mayor's party organizer, then accused Tremblay of unassantly closing his eyes to the parallel budget that brought dirty money into his coffers.
Following the revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been advocating since 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters right in the middle of a booming real estate business.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
He says of the investigation, which will finally be launched, that he is "pulling the strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the ant-infested system to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
The process, she says, is "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need to set up our own investigation unit in Montreal and ensure that these dubious practices cannot be reversed.
It's like cleaning up.
regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "members informed of this ruse" if they have not been involved in these scheming!
He estimates that 70% of Quebec's election campaign funding comes from dirty money, adding with irony, "I hear it's just a weak decoction of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not solve the situation, he says: "Until election spending is severely curtailed, dirty money will not disappear from politics."
It proposes a comprehensive review of the system of public procurement and financing of the parties: "We cannot go any lower; if we boldly focus on the substance of things, we can build again on stronger foundations and with greater control and respect for the law."
If this story has denied the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends anyone who mocks him to look in his own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
You and PSG have set a whole new pace this season.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other, or by the completely new dimension of PSG.
The big players came to us.
Every day I get further alongside them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier in fights.
Everything's going so fast in football.
But I'm not wassuing my head.
From my early days in prep school at INF Clairefontaine to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always taken it to the next level.
So you're taking advantage of the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
Reinforcements from this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training session is essential.
And it follows that a player like me has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my position.
He's got assistants like Claude Makelele, who used to play in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the final say at the right time?
naturally.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, he does not have an equal in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
I had a soothing conversation with him in January.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you view the first part of psg's season?
In League 1, Lyon took away our lead.
But we're staying in tow.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have very easily progressed to the eight finals.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we certainly want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group first before Porto so that we can play in a rematch of the eight finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make history.
This is not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG have the means to make this intention happen.
And would it be a big failure not to win League 1 like last season?
Of course, that would be very disappointing.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had what it took to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more amazing season.
I think it's going to work this year.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are also seeking the title, I think we have the weapons at our disposal to beat them.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
It's not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what's been invested here and what kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is, if we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there's still something in the papers that they blame us for, it's not very pleasant.
One wonders what more people might want from you.
Of course, you can't win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We try to set our game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who have not reached the last eight for the second season in a while, and they have also invested large sums!
Given the sums invested, you might expect to be 15 points ahead of the others!
You're insulting the other clubs and the French league.
Lyon and Marseille, who did not fare so well last season, moved on to the next stage with the new PSG.
This shows how amazing League 1 is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
PSG seem to be relying on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's performances in everything.
It's a good thing they say there's an "addiction to Zlatan."
That means Ibrahimovic is very efficient and scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's a Major League One star.
Everywhere he's passed, he's proven himself to be a big player, a world star.
We respect both man and player on our team.
He respects the people around him, too.
What he's achieved is truly extraordinary.
This led others to raise their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you feel about Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play the way I'd like.
But I've been there, and I've come out stronger.
Today I manage to play good matches in the national team.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I started representing.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our behaviour exemplary.
How do you look at Didier Deschamps' first months at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in the World Cup qualifiers.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can get excited about winning.
So was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps can lead our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1-1) from October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This match has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
Thanks to Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true in these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, inventored by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), represents both virtual money (convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows file exchange between pairs of partners.
With 15,000 computers connected to the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About 1,000 websites already accept Bitcoin as gifts or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin's exchange rate first peaked at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, and is now at a point of about $10 (a list of exchange rates is listed on page bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this in its virtual finance report, which was published in October.
He calls Bitcoin "the most successful virtual money," "competing with the dollar and the euro," and "the equivalent of ordinary money."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like "credits" used to advance a video game that a person gains by a game or can buy (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Every month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are depositories of current account books, controllers, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
In fact, each transaction between two users takes place between two electronic addresses by e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
This a way, the network can verify the validity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoin exchanged exists in the public current account book, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key stage is to write this new transaction to this book.
It is done by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, the solver of which, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is the stage of dismembering the file; i.e. transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it before "chopping up" the whole.
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes can easily check its correctness.
The transaction then appears indestructiblely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would alter the fingerprint.
If the user wants to pay twice the same money in a row for the purpose of fraud (within ten minutes), the network will confirm only one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, since each of them has a different imprint.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this remuneration is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they can be divided up to 100 millionth, so there is room for margin...
The difficulty of the specified task also increases as the calculation level increases.
The network has seen its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been hacked and stored bitcoins have been stolen.
"The loophole used is not about the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls money laundering possibilities through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Major players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, embrace them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a current account book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
"Huge discounts" were launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which is involved in converting Bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up at merchants where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems and move to more horizontal systems.
"It's going to take a while for Bitcoin to make it, but 2013 could be a decisive year," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The greatest harm was suffered by the people in the Afghan countryside, who we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so did we, for we have lost 88 soldiers killed, and what about all those wounded and mutilated.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but they are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they've been joined by jihadists, Pakistan, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent assistance from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will fall.
The departure of French troops from the nijrab base, which I watched from the tops of almond-coated mountains thanks to French loans, was an orderly one.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul unattended, accompanied by helicopters.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable procedure between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the country was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their takeover of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the darkness of these peasants, which al-Qaeda had completely taken over, but their situation had not improved until now.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban all agree to keep women in a subordinate position.
The chief dignitaries of the war against Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seize state lands that they sold as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge American contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; moreover, most of them have never even been in combat.
From what I've heard in campaigns, people want a government that won't be made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the way those who have been able to take advantage of America's generosity leave: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and the ideology associated with it.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they recognized the modern world and were intrigued by its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, public schools are full, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be given jobs, they no longer want to go back to the darkness of the former parties or the corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; television and Turkish series that show the modern world are watched everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities who take the lead be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already rebuilding provincial militias that will be out of the control of central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence on local identity, should enjoy a degree of Western-led decentralization, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so that the post of prime minister that had existed since the constitution was adopted in 1964 was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been restored, no dam is working, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced but fruits and vegetables.
Priority shall be given to a private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
And that only fueled the feeling that Western states were only there to seize it.
However, without energy for the processing of iron ore or copper on the ground and without the means of transporting raw materials through the mountains, no mineral extraction can take place.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the sprawling Buddhist site to retain their role as the most important employer in the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of their imports and exports depend, will also need to restore normal relations.
The departure of french combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of common types of assistance: girls' and boys' lyceums, French departments at universities, French institutes, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "win heart and soul" initiative has been in place, attempting the difficult task of aligning aid and military activities, which then operated the Ministry of Defence's (Cimic) "Civic-Military Action" service, which was abolished in 2012, but achieved a number of successes in terms of common interest and agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages thanks to a small French NGO.
These works, involving a large number of local workers, helped to dampen the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and the expansion of the subdisible area.
What memory do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often located above 2,000 m above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural assistance from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, these farmers, they say, wish to achieve little civil aid to their benefit, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Difficult work on egypt's constitution
President Mohamed Morsi has embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, despite everyone else's opinion, he announced that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state granted the assembly another two months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal conjecture.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the opposition's point of view, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continues to "violate his word" and "tramples on the law."
But his supporters assure that this is a means of turning the constitutional and political crisis around as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
There should be a referendum in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention to clarify the text to the Egyptians article by article.
For the president, it is also a way to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while protests are slashing the country.
As he confirmed in an interview with Time magazine, Muhammad Morsi seems confident that Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially since this haste-organised vote puts the Egyptian people in front of an ultimatum: 'Either you approve my text or I will keep unlimited powers', which should otherwise end after the new constitution is approved.
And in this strange atmosphere, yesterday, 85 members of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the constitution was proclaimed, they slammed the door, saying they had no way of asserting their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society, or members of religious minorities mimicked their move.
In order to achieve the quorum, 11 alternates were hasty yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators also wondered that one of the many controversies that day revolved around... hours of prayer when some members of the committee took the view that the hours in the meeting room were not adjusted correctly.
The text voted on last night consists of 234 articles.
The subject matter of general attention, Article 2, ultimately remains the same as the 1971 version of the Constitution, laying down that 'the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law'.
Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the fundamental requirements, had hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules," which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," argue liberals who see it only as a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they focus on Article 220, which entrusts al-Azhar University with an advisory role, in particular on issues of checking compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "those called to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
The beginnings of theocracy can be seen in this".
Liberals' fears are further slightly slightly sutated by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, there has been no particular religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulams, but university workers, many of whom have graduated in French schools," says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on egypt's constitutional transition.
However, it agrees that 'there may be contradictions as to the interpretation of Article 220, since the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science] in particular.
And in the future, the question may arise to what extent civilian judges are competent to comment on this".
Yesterday's approved text, in addition to religious sites, has been heavily criticised because of the extended powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that they have been severely restricted from the former regime.
Another point of contentious place: the powers conferred on the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the representatives of the army, the verification of the defence budget will not be carried out by parliament, but by the National Council of Defence.
Furthermore, proceedings against civilians will not be banned in military court, as requested by human rights associations.
These associations speak of their doubts in relation to the text which they believe is directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article is about protecting women, points out Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President was due to make a televised address last night, rallies are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then manifest on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the navel of the world and the sea of a suvelte salt solution await Ukrainian tourists
The promised land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and the pristineness of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Bow to holy places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is claimed that god's mercy will descend on all who enter this "bath."
And Galile - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus also appeared to His disciples and after the resurrection.
But most holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers will pass through the Path of Pain, or Jesus' Cross Way (Via Dolorosa in Latin).
It begins at the fortress of Antonio - Pretoria - where the trial took place, passing through the streets of the Old Town and leading to the Temple of God's Tomb on Mount Golgota - to the place of crucifixion, to the stone of anointing, and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which they made a cross for Jesus' crucifixion.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest site for Jews - the Wailing Wall, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Make the vertical journey
The ruins of Masada Fortress remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy herod the Great built for his family in 25 BC.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those engaged in climbing can reach it on their own.
Others will be taken to this historic mountain by cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which is experiencing a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus shuttle transports tourists from the foot of the hill to this ski paradise.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods reportedly lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, which is located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It stores ancient Kumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel-Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
His exhibition is widely represented by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Museum-Spa, which introduces visitors to several rooms of the ancient Turkish baths with mannequins of spa users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea, the unique private Ralli Museum is worth a visit, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic aspects of history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are glittering.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
Israel's three main spa resorts are on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each offers swimming pools, water park, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea it is possible to bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air heats up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
Dead Sea, by the way, is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest land point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
The azur water in it is a saline solution that easily keeps even people who can't swim afloat.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and healing mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes to cure your messy nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by an ancient part of Tel Aviv - the small town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mesopotamia.
References to this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Indeed, tourists love wandering the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you cling to the walls in the aisle of "your" sign, your happiness will be favorably favored.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully renovated theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, for a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For the trip, it is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars that you can easily exchange for shekels (now $1 is about 3.8 shekels).
Buses are the bus in particular, but jerusalem has a express tram, and Haifa is the country's only metro line with six stations connecting the lower city with the upper one.
It's basically an underground cable car.
Traveling through all kinds of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive 1.5 hours with a change of car.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Shabbat is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturdays, work stops at markets, shops and public transport.
And sunday morning starts the work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you only get kosher food: with the exception of pork, seafood, scaleless fish and foods that contain a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various types of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other other way, there are many fattened cats that gracefully "wander to their taste".
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The front cats love crowded places and are happy to embark on every goodness.
Car rental will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day, depending on the car's brand.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to explore the country and rest.
Between January and October 2012, 118.8,000 Ukrainian tourists visited the promised country, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa was cancelled on February 9, 2011.
"Big and powerful" announces it to Moscow: emigrants save money on language
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the Compulsory Language Testing Act, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling 'forged' certificates
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
Their only goal is to raise enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December, a law came into force under which every migrant working will be obliged to pass an examination in russian language skills.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service, housing and municipal sectors, lifestyle and retail.
However, the FMS promises that over time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Knowledge of the language will also need to be confirmed in order to obtain and renew the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Nor are people who successfully achieved attestation and obtained an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to this law.
Benefit, conviction and protection of rights
The network of test sites will work under the auspices of pushkin's Institute of Russian Language, The University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centres are already open in Russia.
Members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Service) also supported the initiative to support the introduction of testing.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all - the representatives of the migration service respond - this will make it possible to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labour."
Many people are talking today about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, Chairman of the Board of Directors of FMS Russia in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowing the language - Sebelev says with conviction - the future migrant is doomed to confront dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, provide him with a "voucher" to horrible, tight hostels where he and dozens of others like himself will spend months without food and documents and torment for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"In their homeland, they promise them one thing, but on arrival they cheat them, confiscate their passports, do not pay the promised wages," confirms ms. Tolib Sharif, head of Tajikistan's Main Labour Migration Administration.
Don't sing!
All the less so because many citizens of the Central Asian republics who intend to go to Russia for work acknowledge that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to get to, but do not even have experience with the job.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as misfortune: very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed their children something, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed and equipped for school.
As children reach working age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the Language Examinations Act, human rights defenders point to one important point.
Testing will only be carried out on those migrants who are in legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't take exams or get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally as before in Russia.
"Welcome, or Forbidden Entry Forbidden"
Many of the incoming workers claim that obtaining official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police employees know that we basically have fake documents, no registration, and that implies extortion cases.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," said Umed Khuchadamov, a Citizen of Tajikistan, to journalists.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the Language Act, it was found that it is not only the migrants' registration documents that are fake.
FMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates of completion of the language examination.
Forged documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants paid seven thousand rubles for this document in the hope of facilitating the problem of passing the tests.
This is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
Thus, the main task of the near future is to secure the system from corruption, so that workers cannot simply buy documents, government officials and human rights defenders agree.
In the meantime, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the tests the first time the time they need to take a course on the basics of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active dealing with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not circulate the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
The Ministry of Foreign Relations of Russia is proposing to tighten the law in relation to civil arms owners.
It is the government's response to recent events: the impetus was the shootings at weddings that went without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven people dead.
The police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and raise the age from which a licence to carry weapons can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma's Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who has promised that changes to the arms law will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demanded the rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist, in an interview with the BBC's Russian newsroom.
According to Statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms offences were committed in the six months of 2012 registered by the Authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while a total of 1168 000 offences were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter believe that tightening civil weapons legislation will not force perpetrators to switch to the "black" market.
According to them, any weapon can currently be found in Moscow at a low price.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired Colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years in the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept arms orders
The first one - the "army or military route", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baraněc.
Another type of "black weapons" are weapons stolen by criminals from law enforcement officials.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses as well as weapons stolen directly from law enforcement employees.
Illegal "barrel" are being marketed from military warehouses.
Explosions often occur in many military warehouses.
"It is proven that some fires were set deliberately - to cover the manka," says the former soldier.
According to Barance, arms manufacturers also make their contribution.
"Private arms companies that are not competitive on the international market are currently being created and are eliminating weapons that they supply to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small-scale production, and a mafia was created that organized their smooth production," explains the former soldier.
Where did the gun come from?
Experts have added up the approximate share of the different sources of supply of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists disassembled the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons were on the black market "due to officials whose work is associated with guns," the report says.
According to the data available to researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases weapons were stolen during their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
A salesman-consultant at one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, believes that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" are no longer being bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, sellers go directly to military warehouses for new shipments.
Through ensign, the bidder buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him, and he sells it to you over the fence.
"He takes it into town and sells it for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," he says.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever they have a plan to clarify crimes, they make a control purchase from illegal arms dealers," the adviser adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Sellers and buyers are most often found through their acquaintances.
I visited websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the opportunity to go to the "Trial" platform, where there would be a man to lead me to the "corner" where we would act together.
I only found out the price there
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman- counselor.
The sellers are on the market, but there also needs to be gone, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that my daughter's tooth fell out."
And now I'm going to get there through a man I'm sure of.
He'll only deliver them to me, because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was working on a publication on the subject.
The schematics, he said, had not changed.
They gave him a photo album that said "everything you thought."
"I felt like I was in a fancy shop," the soldier recalls.
To the buyer, in the words of Baraněce, they do not offer a hare in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just don't buy - we go into the woods with the seller and we build a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and if I make sure the gun shoots well, we start acting," the expert describes the procedure.
Tray on the sofa
Search engines will take you to websites and groups on the Internet on "Vkontakt", where it is offered to buy a weapon "for various purposes".
No documents or face-to-face meetings are required for this.
"Just have a set amount of money," they write in an ad caption on the "Buy a combat pistol or machine gun" website.
On this site, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And selling to minors?
"Of course not licensed," enquins user "Ivan" (spelling is preserved).
"I'll buy TT. Moscow" - briefly formulates the requirement "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service has recently tossed a vast network of websites, and people wishing to buy a military weapon can rake in a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military correspondent and senior military dignitary Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment via ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photo and a description with instructions on where the gun is hidden," says Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the NGO "Right to Arms."
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will typically pay between $100 and $900.
In the words of Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "Right to Arms", you will get a Makarov pistol for $100 to $300.
You have to wait a month to one and a half months.
The weapon is shied from storage for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle cell.
According to the official statistical office, the number of such crimes in Russia decreased by a total of 7% compared to the period January - October 2011, amounting to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers go through work at the box office of "McDonald's" establishments
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages has risen in America at Walmart hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as "McDonald's," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth wave, or whether it is destined to pernite soon.
The whole event is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that regular workers receive at Walmart and fast-food systems, protest organizers aim to create unions in them.
At present, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, when America was hit by an of cheap sales, engulfing millions of residents and, in some cases, accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some walmart workers, which has 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces to demonstrate with unions and left-wing activists of multinational retail chain companies whose goods are destined for lower- and middle-class people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk around the world.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage employees in Walmart stores only shop at their own work.
The availability and range of goods have made walmart one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply, partly because it pays little to its employees.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or handheld scanners.
On "Black Friday," protesters demanded a raise and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the company had risen sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart worker gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn't match the cost level, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is on average 1.1% more than this company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart shifts the wage increase fully to consumers' shoulders, each in-store visit will cost only 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart's defenders point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should cause virtually no harm to the company.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its coffers made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, a representative for the company, said in an interview with the left-leaning Huffington Post website that "fewer than five" Walmart employees had left their jobs in total, and that the protest was "another media sensation" organized by the union.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart department stores (those in that progressive city are not very popular, and therefore almost not here), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick leave and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, the minimum wage for work is $7.25 an hour in accordance with federal and New York state laws.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually raising that wage, but only slightly, and on average, their regular workers in New York city are getting $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive city has a lower wage.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work part-time behind the counter after school and live with their parents pass through a mcdonald's job.
Few people see this as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for long.
Nowadays, I constantly meet in conversation with "McDonald' workers who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children from it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at a McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs at fast-food restaurants start receiving at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the creation of trade unions and punishing union activists by bullying and firing.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
However, it is also difficult to introduce trade unions in fast food companies for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high turnover of employees.
disagreement
On this day, noisy protests were also held at a number of other budget Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the event was a noon rally at "McDonald's" near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, most notable city council member Jumaane Williams, spoke, saying,"McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and then doesn't even pay you sick leave and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
Other prominent New York Democrats, such as city mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, also received support from protesters, who said that "we must come together to support fast food workers so that they get the fair reward for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As described in the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of america's fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated, though not all of them were fast-food workers who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become the spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
"So far, the brain has managed to deceive on average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technologies, the theme of augmented reality is popular; lately, this means seeing the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
At its annual conference earlier this summer, Google demonstrated the working model of the novelty, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a patent application.
An interview with the head of microsoft's interactive 3D technology group, Sharam Izadi, shows that glasses are a thing of the past for the company's scientists.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us what your research group is doing?
- We deal with human-machine interactions, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of that interaction.
Humanity, meanwhile, is stuck in the phase of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with its finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years in advance and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is for sale without Kinect sensors, because for everyone the possibility of controlling with gestures is very interesting.
- What else do we have in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred the interaction to the physical level, very many interactions still take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow has not yet been particularly good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to get to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more suitable form.
And first of all, to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but it's not overestimating?
- It certainly cannot be considered a cure-or-treat - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our vicinity about our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not smy ones, just such sneering, short ones.
The gestures would not be captured by the device's camera, but by a bracelet that would track the movements of bones and muscles.
It's big so far, but theoretically it can be down to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
How?
- How, for example, are you going to ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very difficult to tell.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what a machine can or can't do at a given moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's a rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a fairly good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - that's what we can bounce back from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, it's the matrix and the depth.
At the same time, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this assigns work to algorithm designers.
So we must bear in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axis, but also the Z axis.
So speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and current data flows of 30 frames per second are frankly a little low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond has made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with current, mass-produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just don't need so many touches, but I need some extra frames per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- Three "cameras" are now used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera - this is actually a common visible band sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of an object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect system, play with the curvature of the camera location and see how this will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- As I recall, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don't you think that when it comes to the daily use of augmented reality technology with special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around while constantly holding the smatphone in raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be a "portable" form of reality expansion, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphone, projection display and further around on the basis of the clouds platform.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, that is their strength (only you can see private things), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time as other people.
Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out:there is no touch response!
Hands can't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think supplementing tactil perceptions could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a kind of substrate for display.
It records compression in an excellent way!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding palpability to these "images in the air" - for example, interference with several directional ultrasonic rays at a defined point where the finger is located, it evokes a tactary sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on the tummy of your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think he's feeling what he seems to feel at the moment when he sees something?
That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for a long time to come - how to make a person who is physically in a very confined space believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a goal, then work is still for many years to come.
This is what makes virtual reality work so appealing to researchers - many things are in the very beginning.
Tasteful instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the "St. Petersburg Avant-Garde" project, dedicated to the citizens who lead the way, the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already prominent figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe without achieving all-Russian renational renationalties.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in trendy pubs and at openings.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they are displayed, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical Storytellers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition to being an urban person, his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the face of citizens, raising everyone's mood.
He recently took up the flynet and became a St. Petersburg schming, because he matured into this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you walking around town in red and not yellow or turquoly?
- I chose red as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red paint represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
Although in general, anything that differs from gray only slightly arouses aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at having a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is primarily an invitation to debate.
And when did you understand you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the House of Culture in Yev, where my works were exhibited.
I understood what my path was.
At that time, a wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I could not understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the artists of the new wave, the post-Gazoněvs, who led us to pushkin 10, and there were no more waves.
It attracts me to theatre, dress, music, all genres except the word.
- And it was all merged in your art clinic ...- For me, it was important to find myself at the center of the culture of Petěrburk, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995 I occupied a place at Pushkinská 10, and there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, the home of the Petěrburk bohemian before reconstruction.
There was a lot born: NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how Shnur was brought in with the project "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Snare and his friends sang light songs under plywood, dressed in tight leotards, among them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galiv times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, which started his great career, he got his basic education and training from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberation of the Art Clinic.
This is where our working and regular guests left.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, a survey was organized was in the press, the special prize was "People in our city".
I was named artist of the year in the nomination, which ended my peak.
In new times according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In today's years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characterized in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which topicality and penetrating are vividly captured.
I'm going to have a program exhibition called "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, today being like this is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is wiping away, tragedy is scanned.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the order of order.
Today, people meet according to clothes, focusing on external mechanics, not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and spat in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated by changing.
- We saw you the other day as a city schmy-man.
And who should be if I'm not?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial, ermous art should be thorough, tit-to-date, sweet.
Cultures are falling apart.
In the old days, people gathered in clusters, bohemians loved one simple other people.
Today everything has broken down in micro-companies, today it is very difficult to like everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill for everyone to like.
Today you have to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand spectators will come to the Stasa Michailov!
- He's going to get the fans, he's got a sexually social sphere involved.
And 300 people come to cultural ground and 10,000 don't come, and as a result, less management, less money, everything withers.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one fools them and violates what is in the experience.
When I was young, I used to paint pictures that hung on a collector's wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
Nowadays, people often confuse concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that is from other people.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, turned down money to draw paintings.
And I'm all for that culture.
- Cyril, what is the shortage in Petěrburk?
- Good culture experts.
There's a concept: a cultural agent.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper tsai, this was not the case in everything, the tsaiers may not have understood much about culture, but they understood the need to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Here in St. Petersburg we have people who could be experts, but they are tucked away somewhere in a corner, because great experts are needed to properly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Tasteful is thriving today.
The same Erarta, but differs in that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
What do you think Petěrburk is?
- Petěrburk - this is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is a lot more culture, there is the right land.
And on our eels, art thrives miserably.
We need cultural ground, but there are more writers than readers in our country today, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are inquisitive, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable affair, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented with the resources of the St. Peter's Grant
Give birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board set off in search of a replacement planet.
To save mankind, the main question arises: how to keep their genus in weightlessness conditions or on a given surrogate planet?
I don't think the choice is very great.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be adopted, if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Surdin, a senior research fellow at the State Astronomical Institute of P.K. Šternberg (SAIS).
But while conditions for life are better on Mars, temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius on the surface of Venus.
Living there is only possible at high altitude or in orbit of Venus... in space.
Scientists with flora began to address the issues of reproduction in the universe.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their Earth relatives.
After that, the insect was carried out in orbit - a very small fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to check how an embryo develops in a weightless state.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the ascent.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem arises with the fact that this bird has to find support, it has to stand on its own two feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) RAN.
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaotically and make somersaults.
After 10 hours, the instincts of freshly hatched birds completely disappear.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, within four days, they just died.
"We hatched birds twice, but then we refused because it is simply impossible to work with them there," comments Vladimir Sychev, commenting on the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments will continue.
But only beings of one sex will be in the biosately "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already being transmitted into space.
They basically didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was only on biosatelites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, the cosmic rats were born offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a tough assignment.
Animals, when losing the usual environment, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens rules with abstract thinking and is able to create a corresponding emotional background.
For ethical reasons, similar experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was to Treškov.
The most precious thing mankind has is a woman's body.
Our Tchaikovsky flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether she could withstand a flight into space.
Whether she can have a baby after such a flight.
"No one has ever answered that question," says rocket-space veteran Vachtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after flying into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Treškovová gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savická was born, who visited orbit twice and who also worked in open space.
However, the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who have been born and grow healthy offspring after many years.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous even in orbital flights," says cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the formation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions of zero attraction, astronauts acquire the habits needed to work in the open universe.
Water mimics weightlessness.
Although water is a comfortable but strange environment for adults, it is a natural element for young children.
Little ichtians seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is in the mother's amniotic suave water for an average of 9 months and that it makes it easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, only 2 weeks will have been spent.
"That's very little for a child to forget," says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short - if weightlessness is a more natural condition for a newborn baby, then for women, gravity, an attractive force, is more natural.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles wither very quickly, the body's ability to expel the fetus decreases.
We can leave this aside as long as the muscle stimulators during childbirth work.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber, in which the mother's organism exors the fetus.
"What next?" asks Valery Polyakov, asking difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If earthly attraction does not affect the organism, it cannot properly form a skeleton or a system of muscles.
A newborn in orbit cannot be dressed as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he could train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs to develop.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows a child to be born in a foreign environment, we will bring a disabled person to Earth who will be completely unac adaptable to the local environment," predicts Igor Pestov, head of ibmp ran bioethics commission.
So the child-in-space age is now only a theoretical question.
But there will come a time when it will become a reality, and when earthlings will go in their ship to a distant planet that will become home to their descendants born in the universe.
SAO chief: Sao T-system review failed due to politicians
The Czech Republic has good controllers and quality legislation in relation to public procurement, but it is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office, says so.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what I think is lacking in our country," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also indicated by joint control of Czech and German controllers.
He cites Petr Nečas's approach to the so-called "scheming system" as an example of misconduct.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with its inspections - so is it banned or allowed?
"The law has to be set up somehow, and if he bans something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the office from operating, which has a duty to come and check and enforce obligations," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
It's a parallel check that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how public contracts are dealt with, followed by individual national legislation and then practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the inspection is not yet complete, we have shown very interesting differences - generally speaking, legislation is perhaps even "stricter and more perfect" in our country, however, the practice itself is better in Some parameters in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more precise rules over and over again, but it is necessary to devote ourselves to the application of the law itself.
What can this project do you any good, what does it mean for you?
It is precisely such joint control that could help us to stop making efforts to refine laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But by lowering the order limit, we do not necessarily have to achieve this.
Maybe the system will become so full of "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw on it much more easily than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an office similar to our SAO, or is it set differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, just as the SAO operates there, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised like us, also has a college, it just forms in a slightly different way, but basically both offices do the same.
The powers are similar to some extent, but because Germany has a federal arrangement, it also has these court of auditors at the level of individual Länder - that is where the system differs a little from ours.
Brh can only control federal money, represented by state resources in our country.
Public funds, which are managed by regions and municipalities in our country, are controlled there from the level of federal court of auditors.
As far as the legislation there is concerned, it's simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, however, in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better at everything.
So is it also because they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but again, I don't like comparisons like that.
But it must be said that even the countries that we consider to be role models face a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any good for them to cooperate with our office, would it?
As regards domestic legislation, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, are its effects already being reflected in any way?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet reflected in the control actions.
Since we do ex-post checks, there's a certain delay to be expected.
So far, we are only observing this in the process of preparing future inspections - we have launched our new tool for 'detecting risks of inepability', through which we have driven almost 14 000 public contracts, and analysed them - there these changes will, of course, be reflected, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tender will be adjusted and so on.
So do you consider the approval of this law to be more of an asset or an additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that this will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that the rules will be "tightened up" and cannot be followed.
Already under the operation of the previous rules, the auditees are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act is a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it worth tightening the law in this way?
Not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who wish to attack and abuse it, not punish those who commit formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do you get out of it?
Let's see which way doesn't lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs by checking the so-called 'schmress system' - and what does that mean?
Is the schmress disabled or enabled?
After all, the law must be set up somehow, and if it prohibits something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the Office, which has a duty to come to inspect and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We're going to change the law and we're going to allow it," but he can't say we're going to act like nothing.
There are fairly strict rules in the Public Procurement Act on how to formally implement what is to be done - which is right to protect public tenders.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - this is what I think is lacking in our country.
Roads are icy in places, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are icy and also snowy.
Most of the time, however, the roads are passable, somewhere with caution.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region, roads were passable this morning, but in places icy and also snowy.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but is expected to warm slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, and there is only a thin layer in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Erzgeies.
In places, visibility was also lower due to fog, according to data from the dispatching department of regional road users.
R6 expressways and first-class roads are now passable in the region without restrictions.
However, caution is in place, for example, on some walls, where the surface may be icy and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
On them, however, in some sections there are still remnants of frozen and sometimes run-off snow.
Especially at higher altitudes, you need to pay extra attention to the ride.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in Eastern Bohemia there is a risk of icing, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there may be a layer of snow on the roads, informs the Directorate of Roads and Motorways on its website.
Road users warn drivers about icing, it can form especially in higher positions of the Pardubice Region.
Ice can be around Lanškrouna, Usti nad Orlice, Polička, Svitav or Vysoké Mýto, especially on roads of the second and third classes.
Roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitav are chemically treated.
Snow is mainly on roads in the Giant Mountains and Orlicke Mountains.
The snow layer is at the highest altitudes on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia, it is mostly clear to semi-clear today without precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with light winds.
Pilsen Region
Roads in the Pilsen Region are passable this morning, but in places with caution and driving it is necessary to adapt the weather.
This is freezing in the morning, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below freezing.
After previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some roads may be icy.
In places, drivers must also expect fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is based on information from the dispatching department of the regional roadworks.
The D5 motorway is passable almost without restrictions, but caution is advised by road managers between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, there may be icy sections in the southern Pilsen and Tachovsk region.
Second and third class roads are humid, and in this case, too, there are warnings about icy sections.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region must now count on snow porridge on the road.
After the chemical shoal, it remained on the Red Mountain Saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videl cross.
Road users were driven into the field by snowfall at night, and in Šumperk, according to road managers, they snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the region, roads are usually passable without restrictions.
"In Šumperk, there are remnants of snow at the highest altitudes.
Drivers have to count on snow porridge on the Cervenka saddle in the direction of Jeseník," the dispatcher of the Šumperk Road Administration told ČTK today.
Their colleagues also went into the field at night in Jesenice, the roads up to ae the highest positions are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, roads are passable without restrictions, but in šternberk drivers should be careful in forest sections where roads remained damp.
Ústí Region, Liberec Region
Several difficult-to-pass places are reported this morning by road users in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with snow or glaciers, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústecko is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures stay below zero even at lower altitudes, so ice and snow are likely to stay on the roads. On the contrary, there are no problems in the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Uplands, and roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the iceberg is reported by road users especially from the surroundings of Szczcly.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal for her at night - rain and melting snow during the day, clear and frosty at night.
Unfavorable conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border of the Usti and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent branches of trees, which bent under the snow to the road.
Šimon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other scaremonths that we humans like to catch.
Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to put the end of the world on hold or prevent it.
In December, you will also organize a unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce him to readers?
It's a nationwide fundraiser we've been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, from 9 pm on December 20, 3 concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we invent everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to amassing enough positive energy and preventing the end of the world, we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original sprouts against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing www.e-tap.cz for the first time.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Canceled".
She's already very popular on YouTube, will she also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, that is, if we succeed and the end of the world does not come...
It will be sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
Anthems will also be broadcast in a unique live broadcast on Czech TELEVISION.
He wrote the words to this song and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, in which he also sings Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, since we organize many benefit events and concerts...
We try to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the proceeds from concerts go against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the accessible educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in jedlička institute.
Students of the Jedlicka Institute regularly attend to the school and engage in activities that they enjoy and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to allow them to do so in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlicka Institute, a separate building will be created in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Each concert will feature several bands and performers.
How did you choose them?
We tried to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
You can find out all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "bombastic events" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will certainly prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we are already in the USA, would like to link this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems.
We have five members in an electric wheelchair, its trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, we carry with us, of course, a large amount of cargo and boxes of tools...
However, so far it has always been done without problems, ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared for us, that I wondered many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how the individual differs in accessibility, public access to the handicapped and so on.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, it is in Russia that we have seen that everything in the east is still in its very beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-like, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric wheelchair to move alone in the city center.
There is not even such a commonplace as, for example, wheelchair users prefer in the elevator.
Fortunately, civil associations are already being formed there, which try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
On the contrary, what do we still have to catch up with more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind on...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In both London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very usual for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life there, on the contrary, we are a little ahead of the game with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier-freeness is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with strong wills.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but let's go back a few years what made you start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedlicka Institute as a tutor, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play the saxophone, among other things, so I and a colleague founded an interest music club.
And over time, as our presenter Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand (laughter).
But popularity has only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started connecting with well-known singers and also actively working to promote the band.
We realized that work that can't be seen basically doesn't exist.
Moreover, thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Show business is full of things where one imitates the other.
It is logical in its own way, everything new is accepted carefully and takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I daresay Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression in a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that's natural...
But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are no sufferers of all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means to do so.
I say that when people with disabilities succeed, it's not just a shift for them, it's a shift for society as a whole.
Has being a strict boss helped this success, as many people have described you to be?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many things and demand some discipline.
I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and a head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, go to prep school and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, they quickly leave them excited.
But that's how it works everywhere, in any group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were at its beginnings in 1998?
Only one,Láďa Angelovich.
We're an open group, people leave and come, there's no way to stop that.
If you have the will and taste, the door is always open in our country
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 pm
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will connect by telemost while singing together the song of The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of the studeo multifunctional barrier-free educational centre at the Jedlicka Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is CZK 400, children under 12 years of age have free tickets in the Bohemiaticket presale
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, poland was accepted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency at a meeting of european space agency ministers, the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of agency projects.
But Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts had been flying into space before The Second World War; but they were not always met with understanding.
I will recall, for example, a lecture by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his groundbreaking work Entering Space.
The young engineer's thoughts (b. 1905) left the audience cold, and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award in 1934 for His Entry into Space in France.
The remembered Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and space.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and has written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of astronautics, and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925, a railway track was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to launch the dreads or brake it.
Information about this drain is known only from the period press.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to take over the missiles.
The research was carried out by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the preserved materials that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, research was interrupted.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work of Rakiet - torped powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza by Leliwa-Krzywoblecsky was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were devoted to the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of operation, its activities ended the start of the war.
Further work on astronautics appears in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The company was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, which has four more comprehensive articles on astronautics.
In one of them, from prof.M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with space.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already under way, and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and already in the autumn pta became a full member.
And the following year, the first pta chairman Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) weather rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were launched in the Bled desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another development type should have been able to do real scientific work by now - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the high winds.
However, in 1962 further development was suspended.
The first RM rocket was followed by a Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had 0.4 liters of space, a 0.34-liter Meteor-1B, and a 0.62-liter Meteor-1C.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Institute of Aerospace Institute conducted the development of a Meteor-2 rocket, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions meteor-2h and meteor-3 were built.
Poland's accession to cospar (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later should also be mentioned.
Poland also participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites under the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Law on Public Works.
The resolution has sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue in a broader way.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that individual economic departments, national economic systems, are in a permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unfettered movement of private capital, together with unfettered financial speculation.
Due to significant differences in the price of labour, (wages) there is a price tension.
This concept must be understood as a situation in which a producer seeks to compete by importing cheap goods by 'undershot' the price of a competitor in order to take on a larger market share and the thus increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to translate production abroad, or to buy there cheaply, or to disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus responsibility for unemployment produced by it, the state's social costs necessarily increase.
The whole situation is heathed by the complete unwillingness of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage he has done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistics.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to enter into competition with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments put their own populations at risk to private capital, regardless of the social downturn.
This is reflected primarily in changes in the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force the own population to accept the price dictation of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is done both by a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and by limiting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is rising poverty, along with an increase in the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food dispensers for the poor for many years, who cannot make a living from their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for well-employed people to receive such wages that the state has to pay them to an existential minimum.
Such a scandal was also made public in the case of auxiliary employees of the Bundestag.
Austerity in virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly leads to the same situation in which people, under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social standards, are forced to either emigrate as they did in the 19th century or live on hungry wages on the fringes of society in the hope that private investment capital may one day come to the country.
Here, however, it is necessary to ask where it will come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, or Turk, Moroccan, or Egyptian, or African is still working for a fraction of Europe's wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue, to the annoyion, that the state cannot participate capital in its own economy, that a managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital firmly maintains the view that the State must not interfere with the economy through management interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital is not influenced, it is now actually running politics and thus the whole state in its own egotistical sense.
Here's the unequivocal answer that you do.
The proof is the existence of virtually omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, the granting of mutual benefits, legislation where virtually everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to a lack of funds, commission draft laws to private law firms that are more often associated with industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power thus comes not from the people as proclaimed by Western-style constitutions, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-leaning democracies are now rapidly getting into a situation, as Appiános describes it in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long been in complete disintegration, and the authorities have been occupied by violence.
Bribery, illegal favors, and stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were going on without any inhibitions, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold vote" ..."the character people did not run for office at all, so once, as a result of this disruption, the state was without consuls for eight months." .." Indeed, there was talk that the only remedy in a bad situation was self-control, and that an energetic man had to be chosen."" Appiános thought of Pompey, but he became Caesar, who turned democracy into self-government.
Conclusion As in antiquity, contemporary society is based on a ruthless preference for self-interest, regardless of social interest.
By its very nature, private capital is no longer able to understand and exercise social benefits.
The result now, as then, is an unprecedented de-defecore of elites without any attempt at deeper-than-life reforms.
The causality of the advent of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As things stand, the demise of these systems in favor of liberal-type democracy can be seen as a kind of break with the expectation of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites are completely ignoring the potential hundreds of thousands of lives losses, humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know them from old and new histories.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from competition at both international and internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-social reforms that will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen citizens' influence on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing comes of violence, and it never can" Sting in fragile, whose main verse in the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be none" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reaction has serauched.
Some stand behind Israel, argue its right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are cast as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, genocide against Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fits the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is to blame in the periodic waves of killings and who is the victim, after all, today's people of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
My point is to offer readers a view behind the curtain, a look at who is primarily served by the 95-year-old tension (calculated since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle Eastern country.
Some of my reflections are supported by available historical facts some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of modern history events.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every age, we can find one of alexander the great or napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it has always been these personalities who have completely autonomously guided their actions, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have happened in the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands out one that might consider themselves the head of an octopus (if anyone else stands above them I do not know, but I do not rule it out) - the Rothschields.
They don't say much about them.
of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) back in the 1890s to stop linking their name to the high-crime acts behind them that have always meant consolidating power, multiplying wealth, or both.
They have major holdings in almost all central banks in the world, and against countries where central bank shares are not to be fought or war is being prepared (before the attack on Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia subdued the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the central bank status of Rothschield's Bank of America, began spending his own (government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in a theater.
JFK started issuing its own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, Rep. Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after trying to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Depression of 1929.
Their desire for global power led from 1859 to 1871 to formulate a plan for three world wars by the Mason of the highest, 33rd degree initiation by Albert Pike.
The first war was to eliminate large monarchical state entities in Europe, the second was to eliminate the colonial estate of Great Britain in particular, and the third was to reduce the world's population to somewhere between 0.5 and 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury are enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a pre-front for such a solution), and the ultimate takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families, led by Rothschieldy, works by is to provoke a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
But these solutions are bogey and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see setting up the Fed so that crises like the one they triggered in 1907 are not repeated).
So, after succeeding in launching World War I by assassinate habsburg heir R-U. Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
World War I ended with a sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (there was no longer any need for war to destroy Tsarist Russia), and subsequently the central European power, Austria Hungary, was fragmented.
To facilitate the start of World War II, bankers had politicians create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, creating the precondition for radicalizing the impoverished masses, and then all they had to do was shoal the Germans with sufficiently strong, culprit-denominational and simple solutions to offer the Führer, and then by creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play a role. , and also played the function of the fifth column, in igniting a fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschields instigated the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferring in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews into Palestine, with the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
World War II broke out, whether Hitler had broken off from the chain on which international bankers initially held him, or if everything he had done was hard to gauge, but in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as War Reparations were made to Germany in World War II, the declaration of the state of Israel created the focal point of the war for the third.
If international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, as in the latter, will be victims on the front line of the fighting, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of contentious and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let's just take how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power were at the beginning of everything?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only give people their own candidates to choose from in elections.
Israel's current prime minister, The Hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascist, to international bankers loyal, a politician who is doing everything he can to start a war with Iran that, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to grow into a global conflict, and with Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of all the world's oil travels (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), as well as the destruction of the world economy.
In what light now appear the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn individual is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"And it forces all the little and the rich and the poor, free and slaves, to have a brand on their right hand or forehead, so that they cannot buy or sell who is not marked with the name of the beast or the numerals of its name.
It must be understood: who has sense, let them add up the numbers of the beast.
That number indicates a person, and it's six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When it's at its worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohamed Reza Páhlavi, who fled to the US after the revolution, which had been the patron saint of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the situation offered no positive way out - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it would thus fundamentally threaten trust with allies in other countries.
But the release of hostages was not achieved in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later exacerbated by the fiasco of trying to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their plinth at home triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iraqi sentiment.
The Iran debacle contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Director Ben Affleck's film Argo describes an episode of that history that brought America a minor victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled it.
After complex peripeteias, they ended up in the canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of a film crew that surveyed locations in the country for the filming of a sci-fi big-screen film.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the legend credible, the film project was reported in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time a so-called "caper movie", a story of a successful stunt, a betrayal - an example is the series of Danny's partners.
In the film, moods alternate - on the one hand, documentary sequences from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic period photographs of events as well as the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, lightened passages from Hollywood, dealt with with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then there's scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions- men in suits discussing the situation at the desks, in the corridors of the bureau, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has remarkably succeeded in restarting his career.
The sly actor became a respected director, and even his acting ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime gone baby gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It's also Affleck's first film not to take place in the director's hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that made the director's older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in Argu, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the re-emacing of real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time conveys the emotional confusion and unforeseenness that arises when history is moving somewhere out of the blue.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake crew at a Tehran bazaar).
Too many plots in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer much in the cinematic sense of thrilling scenes.
He almost works with it quite successfully, sometimes he thinks something about reality - everything doesn't work out so elegantly there (a scene in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport averts a phone call in America, and a runway chase seems far-fetched).
But Argo's weakness is the dissuasance arising from the need to show too many plots in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman may be very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film kind of loses its dramatic pull, it's a film that can be watched with mild interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evoking 1970s thrillers.
But it's hard to pull.
But as a reminder of one still-living history, it is enough to demonstrate how exaggerated the notions of all-powerful and omniscient secret services are.
Rules for balloon inflating, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces a survey for the most ridiculous bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most ridiculous regulations or ideas from the EU".
"We were led to this by the last event when the EU plans to adopt a 40% quota for women in charge of large European companies," patrik Nacher, the survey organizer, told Pravo.
Among the absurdities nominated, for example, is the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance rates for men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
Controversial EU regulations include mandatory infusing of biofuels into fuel, which is detrimental to nature, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of hen cages, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
Previously, the fact ban on the use of the term spread butter or the exclusion of classic light bulbs from sale also faced criticism.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from one business or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now enforces the demands of its banks even by threatening a veto).
The lobby's interests were also behind the fact that, for example, top quality bananas had to be at least 14 cm long in the Union and were not allowed to show 'anomalous curvature'.
In doing so, the European Commission defended itself by only harmonising the previously inconsistent national standards that have complicated trade.
Despite opposition from some states, the EU has already softened standards on fruit and vegetables, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
Last year's EU regulation, under which inflatable balloons sold must be compulsory, must also be a candidate for winning the poll, as well as a mandatory warning that children under the age of 8 must not inflate them unattended by adults.
The EU has cited US research that says balloons among toys are the leading cause of death for children to suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 when blowing into fair stripes.
Quaint ideas are born at home
The rule concerning European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the subject for Greece, and must instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, Laissez Faire nominated, in addition to some of the above absurdities, eu regulations on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set maximum volumes of food stocks that could be located in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The survey organizers were also intrigued by the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea and the idea of granting subsidies on request for subsidies.
However, these ideas were not created in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by not having the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," jaroslav palas (ČSSD), then Minister of Agriculture, declared in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he stated that a lot of grain was born in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state was supposed to have full warehouses, which he had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros for the Czech Republic's continued access to ports.
In the end, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for obtaining the subsidy was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development managed by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, eu regulatory efforts, as well as the more efficient functioning and development of the union as a whole, deserve more recognition, according to many experts.
A more serious problem, experts say, is, for example, the use of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by the Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The fact that, like other Countries of the Union, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products is also an emotion among Czechs, and it does not always succeed in this match.
After a six-year struggle with the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs defended the designation of Olomouc starches, but domestic rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed "the grounder".
Only cane distillate products and not sugar beet products can bear the name rum.
The official list of registered EU products includes the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany, and Parma ham, for example, Carlsbad biscuits, Pohořelický and Trebon carp, as well as Žatec hops.
Pardubice gingerbread and hořická tubes can also be a trademark of the EU.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how does it come to your mind that he wants to run for president?
I don't want to be a senator or a president.
If it works fine in our country, I'm not running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country steal from the last 20 years, thieves running around, people's taxes and retirement age increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I'm already 40 years old and I'm an independent non-party, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon you went to the Castle.
Don't you turn your back on the people who elected you?
All this time, I've been saying that I'm going to fight for the Castle based on the outcome of the Senate elections.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool for how I can realize my visions.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
But the problem is not only that, as a nation, we swear in pubs and tv, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to make a difference.
To this will be added media that dehones a person and who confuse freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was said to be a journalist or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You went into battle for the Castle with a theso of material and criminal liability of politicians and retrospective property returns of more than twenty million.
To do that, you have to change the law.
But as president, you don't have that kind of authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How are you going to handle this?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for the guidebook to be a free trade, it was enforced.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, it is rejected on purpose, and that delays the citizens.
As an independent non-party, I have much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party labeling and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country from each side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are putting me more to the left.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we move forward.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
I will always support any publicly good solution, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia or the ODS, and I will also oppose a bad idea.
You're damned if someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working around the world, or they've been talked about by major experts.
But without parliamentary support, all you have left are passwords.
And you can't keep up with that in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to assert, for example, criminal and material liability?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to push it through.
If elected president, there is no problem in holding a televised live broadcast, where I will ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And eventually they'd have to tell me why they don't want it.
If there is a strong personality who will name the insurrections, one can push the political scene.
Take direct election of the president, that was due to public pressure.
Frankly, I'm an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to find allies.
I have only just started in politics and I will try to get majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to move things on my own if I can't, and in six years, I'm going to quit and go back to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura's going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything in one person, which is why I've been going around a lot of famous people to see if they'd run for Senate, too.
I went to see Radim Jančura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorence, who covered up the light fuel oil scams.
I ran on the notion that people were really dissatisfied, but now I'm on the fence.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who went mostly elected establishment representatives.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have elected the Senate in a way that will make it difficult to push through the changes.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering starting your own party?
I haven't thought about that yet because I don't have time to check every potential stray's clean past, and I don't even have the money.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about property returns, what's yours?
I estimate private property at about 60 million.
I have a plot of land in Prague for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was gallant towards women while fighting against bad things and mischiunds.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a $60 million fortune and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
You want me to go into debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program may not be so interested.
And I'm under no obligation to pay for the campaign out of my own.
The campaign costs will basically cover what I'm going to get the senator's salary.
But I wouldn't make a life out of it, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs $30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're going to keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to dampen these activities?
But that has nothing to do with the salary.
As promised, I partially dampened my activities.
For example, my representative will become the managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Good Samaritan who's going to save the Republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
As an entrepreneur, how much were you used to take per month?
Two hundred to 400,000, which I take further.
And if I were president, I'd shut down my business.

MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don't just happen in the head - spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books, for example - 2 images
"I find the building cheerful, futuristic. Finally, something interesting is on display again," says Lisette Verhaig, walking along the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large enterprise, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
But I ask why we still need a library today.
They all have internet, iPads and eBooks.
No one volunteers for any of these old-style libraries anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam without its own jobs that are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest education rate in the entire Netherlands.
In order to resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago the decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the education offensive was not dizzying.
And so the city councillors recognized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of rotterdam's architectural studio MVRDV, master of insanely daring column charts and a contractor of witty, often even cynical buildings, accepted the thing with the usual calm and appeared at a competition meeting in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the committee looked around in amazement and shrugged, the cheeky Maas piled his gifts on his size and ended his activist-reasoned speech with the words "Dear city!"
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain was tossed up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, The Mountain of Books was awarded the second place of the "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town grey, which has so far had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white façade you'd expect a dairy, is richer in contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
Long way to the book
First impression: the reader's eldorádo under the cheese hatch.
Although there is an elevator through the middle of the mountain massif, you will not discover real spatial and reading passions until you have been walking through the topography.
The glass interior is bright and clear on all sides, the floor of the burnt cabaret and elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally there are bookshelf along the façade and there's a big dark space in the middle that's mostly inconsoly and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We built the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the reader's space from the inside out.
The inside of The Mountain of Books is handily used: in the center there are offices, an internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a control panel of household equipment.
A special pleasing is the black books shelves, which are one wall lining, one windowsill and another a stair railing.
Appearance, structure and smell are strange.
Even sworn architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
And so, one day, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product on a Friesian farm.
For many years, a millimeter fleece made of synthetic matter has been used as a base under the roots in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands.
It is cheap and time efficient.
Thin textiles last one or two seasons, and then it is ripe for discarding into bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in this amount - was pressed on boards four centimeters thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and loadable material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
The 105 steps take you to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long journey, the literary café will reward you not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and figs in pots.
They take care of the atmosphere, but mainly the correct humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite its many glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It heats and cools with earthly heat.
Although The Mountain of Books stands under a glass hatch, the sun shines in only briefly, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden ropes, which stand perpendicular to the glass façade, serve as a shade and catch a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
Fully automatic blinds can handle the rest.
Stefan Spermon, an initial it sceptic, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to Boekenberg as the "long-awaited soul" of Spijkenisse.
Reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
The optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently number 70,000 units, were to be filled first.
The concept worked.
The shelves are completely full.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think our invitation now has a relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
This has done the MVRDV well in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called identity formation.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated he is.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in deciding on the adoption of Palestine.
According to US-Europe relations expert Stephen Szabo, Berlin is teetering on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against a proposal for palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
But now Germany must be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's going to support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
This is because it is in the process of changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was, so to speak, directed by the US, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just settling into their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, as they have in France or the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows readiness to take positions that are independent of those of the US or European partners in the case of national interests.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have economic interests had an impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, they must be careful not to intimidate the public, but also the elites in Arab countries.
That certainly plays a part.
But I wouldn't want to give it too much importance, it's not exactly a one-sided relationship.
In any case, this plays an important role in German considerations.
Has it damaged Germany's relations with the US when Germany abstained on both important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That is why I do not think that this was as dramatic a turning point as it was on the issue of Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even benefit from some respect.
This signals that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other other other, has clearly voted in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal politics.
I think that the Obama administration has a great understanding of the European position in secret.
But, of course, as a result of the political situation there, he cannot take this position publicly.
I think the differences of opinion are really not at all as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US, on the one hand, and with the position of the EU's most important partners, on the other?
I think that's what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead move things forward from their own position.
That's what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, if only because of its relationship with Israel.
That's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as a major international player? Does he even want to take the lead?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to this, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a greater role, anti-German sentiment arises.
That doesn't make it any easier for the Germans.
It is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to all sorts of neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
US influence in European politics is now steadily declining, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment. Who else is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and it makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this lies a designation that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they enjoy protection until they are sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then, it's not clear whether the rights will be up.
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing's office, which specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters only need a few extra letters to sign up for their tags.
Gucci, for example, will become Lu-Gucci and have Prada-Kny registered instead of Prado.
In this way, German companies, such as sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a binder with records of the stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the Zegna DF Puma brand protected there. An artificial name that parasitizes even on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are known to be world champions in copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores in which counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
Pattloch's cases are different. On behalf of its mandants, it is opposed to Chinese firms receiving officially the right to use a label that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," an affiliated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
This is meant by women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's damaging business, we have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand is diluted, the exclusive position disappears, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industry run into millions, especially for expensive demonstration products.
According to data from market research company CLSA, China, with €15 billion a year, is the third largest luxury goods market and the fastest growing market.
However, erasing dubious records in the register of marks is difficult to achieve and it costs something.
The proceedings can be prosaied for up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court dismissed the actions because the name being re-filed had become a "market reality" over a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he still has to pay the plagiarism officer because he damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
Known cases also apply to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the star of a Mercedes.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion goods maker Lacoste lost in China to counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO admits that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few employees and premises.
But last year, "the work process reportedly returned from an emergency to normal."
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
Yet there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
It's expensive to do something about it.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the 10th time in a row.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million of them.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan was collected in fees.
Basically, this means that each login costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
It costs several times to start a dispute against it, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism group for more than seven years.
The Germans achieved that its illegal production of immited car parts was abolished.
However, the counterfeiter continued to secure Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would forget this ourselves, because in Germany surnames cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the Munich firm's objection.
Freudenberg won the right in the next two instances, but the opponent continues to fight the dispute to this day.
You have to be awfully careful
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that he will bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says, "Driving is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. They even had to look at century-old files in the company's archives to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party a "large six-figure sum in euros" to settle the dispute.
"You can see what it means to us," wentzler says.
Europe is in danger of being affected by danger from the Far East.
This is if the immitators secure unprotected marks there.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
The group gave up this area of business long ago, yet managed to avert registration.
"You have to be very careful," wentzler says.
Both he and pattloch, the lawyer, advise German businesses to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international stamp rights. Foreigners should "apply for anything worth protecting in any way in China," wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the final act of its drama, then it may have to pay royalties to the opposing party for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in a contentious segment.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, orphans are happy about it after their parents died of AIDS.
The story of a connection that crosses much more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, there's stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's loathing are looking for a touch on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly rise, urging and prosecuting each other.
The 29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf almost lifts it out of his textile shoes as he connects the voices with his sauching wild gestures.
It's Monday night. In the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty singers and singers between the age of 23 and 69 came, from human genetics researcher to janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has different lyrics and, moreover, in a very foreign language - zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help assistance
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that there are roughly 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in the south of Africa.
There are 245,000 orphans in Swaziland from parents who died of AIDS.
More than 40 percent of the population is already HIV positive.
For 180 orphans of parents who died of AIDS, voices for Africa found patrons in Germany in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend second-grade schools.
Patronage can be taken over for 15 or 20 euros per month.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "one who praises" in the zulu language.
No one can speak fluent Bantu in this space but sing.
For almost a decade, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign soft language, sometimes bringing them back to where they originally came from: the south of Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg is the village of Esitjeni in the northeast of the Swasrian kingdom, which depends on the massiveness of the voices of the German corps.
Forty percent are infected
There are about 2,000 people living there, some still in simple clay or straw huts. A large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they have succumbed to HIV.
In Esitjen, the small, saucy whole of Swaziland can be seen: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the weakened immunity virus within themselves. It's not a rarity that they die in their 30s.
This village was discovered by a choir on a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, however, Imbongi members saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothes, education.
Without a school education, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
At first it was still a private deployment of individuals, which for a few euros a year allowed him to send the child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, the "Voices for Africa" choir was founded, which has since cared for orphans from parents who died of AIDS almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPI also has syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorrhea).
Common viral SPI are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Mueska and scabies belong to parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five all cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently are chlamydia infections, trichomones, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively rare among heterosexual adults in our country, but roughly 20 percent of newly infected hives are in this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the age of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are often found among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infected more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
That's about one-tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a VENE?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be partially transmitted by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money will be collected.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjen," says the association's president, Annette Lennartz.
Money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself, a confident woman who can make her mark.
She also takes care that the impeached children find shelter, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as they call old women in the zulu language, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and made sure that the children arrived every day in uniform for school.
Children who no longer have anyone go to a shelter in Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cookbooks that cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" established a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and, together with the American health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to get an HIV test.
That's not a given. Even though the disease is so obvious all over the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Strange enough, actually, in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his immiable lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-sanized way of life is also to blame for the spread of HIV so rapidly in recent decades.
But so are the many migrant workers who spread the virus around the country.
Annette Lennartz says that while condoms are free on every corner, "no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together every two or three years in south Africa, singing songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and self-confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of black people - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but has also already shed tears with many wild border soldiers.
The path always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village is hardly on the map, it is more than familiar in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is 5,000 miles from here, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on the Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is shining here, too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in an area of this planet that lies in permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
This water appears to have come from comets, or perhaps even asteroids, that crashed into Mercury.
But let's not link the discovery of ice to the existence of life on this planet, said the head of scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help us explain how water and other essential elements of life reached other areas of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unnoticed by Earthpeople, are engaged in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, small windows into endless distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which circles the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" under the International Astronomical Union's new conceptual definition from 2006.
This cutout from the Spitzer Telescope's infrared image shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, the pink-colored "newborns" in the birthing room of the stars are harder to identify.
This area where stars form - scientists unromantically call it W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This moving heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The muffin-shaped ring consists of material that the star ejeded during the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from the gas and dust.
A photograph of the galactic "cradle" was taken by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The Pleiades cluster, also called the "Seven Sisters," is visible to the naked eye at night.
Thanks to the telescope, however, colors stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to the observer in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years from the constellation Aquara.
Its resemblance to the Earth continent earned this nebula the name of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of an extraordinary coloration.
This "baby" among the stars could be fully dreamed up by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
Perhaps these are the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: the swirler galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies, according to their coloring, become real works of art.
The footage, released by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula, in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, three-parted), since dark streaks of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar maternity ward into three parts.
In the constellation Hadonoše, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two flowing galaxies are coming at each other, and a collision must inevitably occur.
This birth of a star was recorded by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can call it the nickname South Windbreaker.
A photo from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a cutout of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cefea.
This 1,400-light-year-old nebula consists of dust grains that are ten to 100 times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring made of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810 by scientists.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to ever-new additions.
Also, these stellar clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, are still giving birth to new young stars. They're 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Scientists believe it originated shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found throughout the universe.
Our views of space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey. Before Galileo, Galilee used it to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been getting bigger - and the views they convey are getting deeper.
The world's largest telescope for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five meters in diameter.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows you to peer into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inside of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only a mirror measures 10.4 meters in diameter.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet its diameter reaches about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the cheap method of construction: the telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, thus reducing its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flow.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, is equal to the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - any computer owner who makes their computing power available can help.
View of the Observation Room of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There's a Very Large Telescope standing here honoring its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can illuminate even the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is supposed to be full of 42 meters and consists of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, the pictures can not be expected until 2018 at the earliest.
Two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also looks into space using the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
A new giant telescope is also to be built on Mauna Kea - with a 30-meter diameter mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
However, the hubble space telescope gives us the most significant impressions from the universe.
He has been providing us with footage of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been detected since the mission started.
The picture shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard an Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6.5 meters in diameter.
One of the telescope's tasks is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume there is ice at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as Messenger circles this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter daily and you'll live to be 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to a biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people live to a biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Driving through the Talys Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles along the road with many turns along densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and simple commoner buildings.
Everything's green and juicy, it almost seems like we're in the Black Forest.
However, this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasus ethnic group of Talys lives, of which not much is known, except that they speak perfect Persian and Azerbaijani and live to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is not suited to the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here. Arriving from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
Eight hours are needed for 323 kilometres, as the road is only single-route.
The fabulous wealth to which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
Pilata Fatulayeva (48), however, is convinced that Lerik has what it took to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
The lives of nearly eight dozen Talys from the surrounding area, who are over 100 years old, are documented here. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he still fathered a child.
However, the controversial star of this museum is sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who is said to be 168 years old.
However, the birth certificate does not exist.
And given that the oldest person with papers was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," fatulayeva explains.
The man was allegedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So was Şirali Müslümov not wrong by a few decades at his age?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of old people in Central Asia.
"Strikingly many people of old live in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "there are also extremely many very old men living in Sardinia."
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age can be provided, especially in the absence of registers.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerik live to a biblical age conspicuously often.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
So why do so many old people live here in the South?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
The director of the Fatulyeva Museum, on the other hand, believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talys, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy does not seem very plausible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik.
At 97, she is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with a buttercoach, which he wobbs relentlessly.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and daughter. They've both been grandparents for a long time.
There are two small children bouncing around.
Tea is prepared in the kitchen, which is served in typical belly glasses of "armad".
Mirzayeva's white teeth form the perfect line, and under the scarf she hides long dark blond braids, which her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look good and kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo, too," mirzayeva says.
A monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst of World War II.
But everything got better when Gejdar Aliyev took over the steed.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is made around the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the hanger.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzayeva receives a pension of 230 manats each month (approximately the same amount in euros). That's a sum of money to live on by local standards.
And perhaps mirzayeva's long-gray son is right: "Old people enjoy great respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of a large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
Unless there's a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of 'human rights' is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The quarent demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep ambivalence.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is being discussed sharply.
Egypt's president spared no pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And I am responsible for doing that, in front of the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but above all to Christian Coptos, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secular persons.
All of them, still hopelessly entased in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a "god-given state" on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi almost apologetized that he had temporarily curtailed the constitutional court's powers and expanded his to "save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, egyptians and the world are not clear about that.
Should the judiciary be removed from power?
The 234 paragraphs, which were hastily approved by the islamist-dominated 100-headed Constituent Assembly in a 15-hour night marathon, are partly of a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the proposal says that jurisdiction is based on "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use this vague wording and the associated legal space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, this is explained by the newly added paragraph: On all sharia-related matters, al-Azhar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with a great influence on all Sunni Islam, needs to be consulted.
This may not, but it may mean that the priesthood will exercise oversight of the legislation, which would bring the judiciary a de facto withdrawal of its right.
In the draft constitution, many things are interpreted
The problem is also that the civilian jurisdiction of military courts is to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's rule to suppress the opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody after the fall of the dictatorship.
As stated in the proposal, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values."
This is so legally stated that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature using this paragraph.
In intelligible language, this means nothing but censorship.
After all, no paragraph defines in writing the explicit equality between men and women.
But another paragraph forbids defaming or defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
However, it remains unclear what defamation is and how it will be prosecuted.
Equally dubious is the wording that "insulting people" is prohibited.
In this case, is a caricature of the president or a joke enough at the expense of law experts?
A matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which Morsi will put forward for signature and, in his words, will present to the Egyptians "very soon" for the purpose of a popular vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks now, opposition to islamists' power has been forming.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday night in an unusual unity, vowing to destroy the constitutional charter before it came into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbah, who came third in the presidential election.
Nobel Laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed Baradej said the draft constitution belongs "in the dump of history."
Through the short messaging service, Twitter accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy."
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brethren is not yet punished," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khalid Alí as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared defiance, but out of caution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters who shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called on Morsi, "Cleanse the earth!" and assured, "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably trigger a civil war-like state.
Morsi's supporters clearly did not want to take that chance.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box which way the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamist proposal is considered certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not occur once"
The enforced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is the year of Hefiz Abu Sa'du.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and chairman of Egypt's Human Rights Watch (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial for Mubarak.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now there are no words for 'human rights' in the new constitution," he complains in an interview with Welt am Sonntag.
Morsi's extension of power to all three powers in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president effectively abolished it," complains Sa'da.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Sa'da feels abandoned even by the international community, which is watching ideological factions on the Nile struggle with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns, "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian rakfisk: The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to a local appetite for an extremely smelly fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it lying for a week.
This gives you an smell paralyzing the smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's greatest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, beautiful views - and there's a ubiquitous smell in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout fermented in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it darkes and it begins to get cold, Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to flock to a festival dedicated to what, best to say, the most captivating food.
"You dream it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk general", who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat small cubes of fish and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink can beat the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus journey.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and since there were no refrigerators yet, the fish were soaking in airtigated barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they were pulled out and eaten - the senses were undoubtedly dulled by alcohol.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings, and a large care system.
The inhabitants of Sweden, an old rival that until recently was much richer than Norway, are pouring into the country for work.
Rakfisk is seen as something important, an indispensable, if rather smelly part of Norway's past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Although everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you £9 ($14) apiece.
Norway often doesn't make it to the global news - and most people seem to like it that way.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children last year, is still being used here with reluctance.
Instead, the shooting is called the "July 22 event."
Norwegians find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway's current wealth lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil isn't the only reason we're doing so well," says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype of Nordic prosperity as she feeds plates of lying coffin.
We are, as they say, prudent people.
Her English, like that of most people here, is impeccable.
We don't show up, we don't like pomp.
Norway handles its oil wealth very carefully - apart from a small percentage, most of the money from the sector is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else was throwing money they didn't have in the years leading up to the global financial crash, the Norwegians had the strings tightly tightened on their bag.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm queuing up in the snow for something to eat - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But in the evening, the smelly fish is here again.
The hotel where I live is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for smelling the most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live TV show in which a presenter with a bow tie is surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havana."
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls from his chair, possibly smothered in aquavit.
Or maybe fumes from all those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a tough start
As mexico's incoming president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor at the moment.
In a city that is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers have been erected to close several key routes to the capital, causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico did well economically when Felipe Calderon was in office, but the country is in the tinge of a drug war that has already taken an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," President Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before shaking hands with the US President, President Peña Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the maniacal and vast state surrounding the capital.
Straight man.
In the rural town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered fondly.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto has built. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that were here before.
Boards with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on the subject of climate change.
"We expect it to bring about real and lasting change," says gabriel olvera Hernandez, a friend and political ally of President Peña Nieto's Party of Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for interesting and real changes in the area of security and the economy that our country so badly needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI was empressed by Vicent Fox.
Olvera admits that after 12 years away from the Los Pinos presidential palace, much is expected of Enrique Pena Nieto within the party.
And he rejects the opposition's comments characterizing the new president as a man without substantial content.
He is a very straightforward man, very interested in an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and most importantly, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyoth, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Tucked under highway overpasses, it is reminiscent of the suburbs of mexico's capital itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, the army was called in to help manage drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly violent violence against women.
In the last two years or so, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to a huge waste dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women had been murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
At best, Peña Nieto's critics say that he has failed in his time in office to adequately address the problem of women's murders.
And at worst, they're accusing his management of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photographs of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed," Mrs. Buendia recalled.
There were signs of blows, and the rigor mortem had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, right next to the cross with one word on it: "Justice."
However, this, as the family says, is exactly what they were denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker and a whiner.
They just want you to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But that can't be right when there have been so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The sherpa that President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday is accompanied by great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by violent crime, and the new president has promised to make it his priority while in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," says PRI MP Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, military prosecutor says
Military prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of mistreatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's time in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed based on manning's mistreatment in prison.
A private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
Military prosecutors are trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the abuse he allegedly suffered while in military custody.
Military prosecutors do. Ashden Fein, under cross-examination by Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, argued that the weekly visits Manning made with the unit's officers during his nine months in custody in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-examination, which occurred during a hearing conducted at the defense's request to dismiss the case against Manning for gross misconduct while in custody, which in itself is a sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning testified that he had contemplated suicide while in custody.
An army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then posted online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein, the military prosecutor, and Manning reviewed the forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at the Quantico detention center, where he was held under a high-security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he rated the treatment on the part of his guards as "excellent" and rated the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional."
The forms show no complaints of mistreatment, although officers directly asked Manning how he was treated, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about various issues orally, and that the officers who visited him had spoken to him about those concerns and indicated that they would address them, but had not seen those problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in January 2011 when he met with a committee to assess suicidal thoughts, which he had expressed on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, his intention was to achieve a reduction in the "injury prevention" regimen.
The military said it had used this restrictive regime (one degree under suicide surveillance) to protect it and keep others safe.
"I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so I can enjoy the elevated quality of life I saw," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transported to a detention center at a Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once fainted there because of the heat.
He said that not being allowed to know what was going to happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very disheartening.
"My world has shruzzed off only to Arifján Base, to that cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said that upon arriving in Quantico, he spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, blanket, tingly, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down was against the rules during the day.
Manning stated that he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He stated that if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned the other way at night, they woke him up and he had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about private Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the allegations he made in thursday's deposition that after being forced to sleep naked in his Quantico cell one night, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates at morning count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket while counting.
In an interview friday with the judge, Manning said that by order of his guards, he decided that he had a blanket to cover up, but admitted that no one had given him the order to postpone it.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because he tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer he could use his underwear belt or his underwear to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his underwear and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that if he is convicted in a military court, which is expected to begin early next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser charges and to fight other charges because they are too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to begin this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning was being held in accordance with regulations regarding all those arrested in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, illegally causing the release of intelligence documents online, transmitting national security information, and stealing public property or records.
If he's charged on all counts, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind them of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to mexico's capital, I barely made it through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda space, where I ran into a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and all my life I've been called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic acronym, just like when my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" and my friends in New York refer to themselves as "Italians."
So later, I ended up labeling it "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use abbreviations.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and lined up for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House this week.
The usual issues on the agenda are to be discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of mexico's economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as to travel to the United States.
It wants to join forces with the United States and Canada to create a trading bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto has vowed to continue Mexico's war on drug cartels, though he has given no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostility.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders, under the threat of weapons, to rewrite half of Mexican territory into the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not minutes, reminders are ubiquitous.
So one minute after the United States representative says something a little critical about Mexico, you'll hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite about Americans interfering with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will step on the warpath.
And yet mexico's real challenge is its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people to whom the country offers opportunities, and others who do not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, maybe a parent or grandparder, who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we're living the American dream now, going to good schools, and having a good job, we can never forget the fact that we're living the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we're aware that many elite Mexicans in the ruling class don't like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat and see us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, in their opinion, is all about failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they would never have left it.
And we would now not be trapped behind the Silk Curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans are more understanding of who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.
Even though she's a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican-Americans I know don't feel part of either.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have roots in either country.
They see us as Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to complicate relations further, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "provisional ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our fellow Americans how great it is to visit this country and press political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
well.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And with income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure it's a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept that some Mexican Americans still feel resentment about the way their family members have been treated in a much closer past.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old Battles, The New Middle East
Ending the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodsuading suggests that any such event is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary conjectures about who started it, many buildings were turned to rubble, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets landed from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and Palestinians and Israelis, like it or not, are caught up in the chaos in the region.
Maybe it'll make their fight more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to believe that this may break their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason to be optimistic at the moment.
Even if the cease-fire concluded on November 21 continues, this week's fighting has strengthened hawks on both sides.
Leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that they forced the Israelis to retreat, even though Gaza suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of Gaza's 1.7 million people in one of the most pitiful and populous corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently controlled by its stageen rivals from Fatah, a more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well judge that time is on their side.
Islamists throughout the Arab world gained more influence, making Hamas powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resuased regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas. So is Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The resentful hamas people say the Islamic Half-Month wraps itself around Israel, in the north from Lebanon, where Hezbollah is ruled by the party/militia, through Syria, where rebels who are increasingly inclined towards Islamism can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
Above all, on Israel's southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, by far the arab country's most populous and pivotal country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosi Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
The Brotherhood, on the other hand, is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be excluded by Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israel's hardliners will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system proved its worth, and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as tey as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
Most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet since suicide bombers, thanks in part to the wall that encroaches on the West Bank, a major part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that are still growing despite their illegality from international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party joined an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil these treacheious Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they be launching missiles like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
Hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
While Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their top priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than that of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments heal their economies.
President Morsi's work with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire is a good sign and may mark the beginning of something new.
Israelis, too, should look at the situation in the long run.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians the right to self-determination creates a powder keg that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this situation as the Arab population grows.
Bloody attacks against Gaza every few years to push back Hamas will increasingly take a diplomatic toll.
Both sides need outside incentives.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and this newspaper are saying: two states where Israel advances territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that a ceasefire will give outside pressures at least a little more influence to enforce this issue.
Egypt, which, along with Turkey and Qatar, must work to stop arms supplies to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 border with the exchange of parts of the country and shared Jerusalem.
Outsider Arabs must also push for a consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN.
President Obama also has his share of getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to enter the process.
That's woefully shortsighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Ugly cigarette packaging laws come into force in Australia
On unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body are depicted.
Australia's ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging laws, the first of its kind in the world, have come into force, replacing the logos and colours of brands with generic olive green boxes with hideous images of sick body parts and depiction of children and newborns sickened by their parents' smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and pictures, as of Saturday, the only difference between boxes is the names of brands that are printed in the same small print.
It is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian Federal Government says the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by depriving the habit of its attractiveness.
It relies on studies that show that if people do not start smoking by the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
"Even with very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them along with their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world, and the changes will have little impact on multinationals' profits, other countries are considering taking similar steps.
The tobacco industry has lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies argued that the law would increase black market trading, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will lead to serious unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring in many more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others say the law has increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for silicone cigarette packaging to cover disgusting boxes increased from near zero sales two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeals to the Australian Supreme Court.
Ha said Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new inventory.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hiccup, experts cite the popularity of social media among the demographic that the plan focuses on.
Tobacco marketing has moved online after a series of Australian laws banning TELEVISION advertising, sponsoring sporting events and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from direct view.
Australia has banned internet advertising carried out by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you're a tobacco marketing executive and you only have this little space left to promote your products, online space is the insurmountable place you want to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms. Freeman noted an increase in the ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook by the "average Honza."
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and went to the bus to make this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how to deal with the new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries trade significantly with Australia.
The SOO's decision is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photos in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering tougher laws.
Many smokers in Australia resist.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and push the box back," says Victor El Hage as he buys a box with a photo of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there's only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack newsagent in central Sydney, says the uniform boxes make it harder for him to balance them into shelves.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them altogether, then we'd say, 'OK, this is it, let's close the shop,'" he said, waving his hands.
In a world of constant connectivity, it's not so bad to be bored
On the last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite distractions with books, magazines and an iPhone (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts in children's development are increasingly coming up with praise for boredom.
They say it's good for us (and our kids) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we have no chance of enjoying boredom.
So should we encourage boredom?
yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to that.
Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011) says.
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
A Latin inscription on the walls of Pompeii related to boredom, dating from the first century AD, was found.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After viewing the research literature and projecting the idea to a target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to do it."
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there's no compulsion to do anything with apathy.
He says the core of boredom is "disrupting the attention process, associated with a bad mood and a sense of slow pass."
Boredom can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they may have a relationship, bored people tend to see the problem as an environment or a world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in September in perspectives on psychological science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated TV program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while a third group could not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but were not sure why and attributed these difficulties to boredom.
When you're trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distracting can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "like finding the wrong parts on a factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and doodling, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help with boredom to fight and keep people physically attentive.
"Research shows that children who are allowed to fiddle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We've all experienced boredom at times - the delay of my flight, the humming speaker, especially the lengthy film.
But some individuals have a better chance of getting bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the Boredom Proneness Scale.
The scale includes questions like, "Many of the things I have to do are repeated and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimulations.
However, teenagers are generally immistent.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
It found that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knew that "adolescence is the peak time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, gamble or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boredom is a way of telling you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you're bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it'll make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child is bored and you give them an iPad, they won't get bored anymore, but they won't learn how to entertain themselves or drive independently, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain themselves, but gain greater self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of reach of the constant thrust of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of needing to be even more bored, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy their free time.
"In an environment where we're constantly over-simulated," he said, "it's hard to find ways to have fun when the noise turns off."
There's no manual in Colorado on the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player from southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for what will soon be legal throughout the state - possession of several grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he was driving with some friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued with a subpoena for possession of drugs and drug-related equipment - minor offenses that are $100 each - and set a trial date.
"They treated us like criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado's vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the place rather than the law.
Hundreds of marijuana possession offenses have already been dropped here and in Washington state, which has approved similar measures.
Police departments have stopped accusing adults 21 and older of possession of a small amount that will be legally permitted after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in colorado's more conservative districts have said they will pursue existing marijuana cases and are still accusing people of possession.
At the same time, several cities in suburban Denver toward the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new state-licensed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This is moving so fast, I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Even regulators in Washington state are gossiping.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a licensing system for cultivation, production, distribution and sale - all by the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first for medical use and now recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it's going to be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Board.
But, as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent to follow," he said.
Washington's law, the so-called "Washington Law of the 1990s I-502, takes effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but legal possession will.
And there are tricky mechanical issues that need to be addressed during this time, such as how to balance the state's directive on "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trafficking within 330 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds, or children's centers.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates sent an email to his officers announcing that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute misdemeanors for possession of small amounts of marijuana for every citizen over the age of 21, and that the police would stop blaming people for those crimes "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said police will enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many face additional charges.
"Our office is committed to prosecute criminal offenses that were crimes at the time they occurred," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response was complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer charge adults with possession of small quantities.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports the decision, but has also decided not to dismiss all pending possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have exposed deep ambivalence among local officials in light of this great state green experiment.
It's a "cultural barrier" for district attorneys, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
Colorado and Washington are on track to become national drug legalization test cases as the first states to approach small amounts of marijuana as alcohol.
Defense attorneys and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Marijuana legalization advocates hope the Justice Department will submit.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana vendors and patients who use it that have attracted attention, the federal government has mostly left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While drug agents are unlikely to break down doors to catch a small bag of drugs, they are likely to defy allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana trades permitted by new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in President Obama's administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal authorities to advance.
Even before Election Day, some local governments had approved moratoriums on any new marijuana business, although it will be about a year before any store can open.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to come into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we issue someone a license and then we get a big federal issue out of it," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the municipality voted for compared to what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a Conservative."
It is not only today's university students who are attacked for their opinions.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at what I thought was the world's largest seat of knowledge, a modern, entrenched Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Meanwhile, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of joining Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my bags and smoured into the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed I gave up because I objected to making love to students in the next room.
The writer A.N. Wilson said in a hearty way that I left because I was forced to drink from battered mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was subjected to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a Conservative Party supporter.
You may ask why I'm bring this up now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of the center is suffering from similar persecution.
The institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students were in favour of equal rights protections for gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College say that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and made clear that they are not welcome."
They are calling for a position on the university's Equal Opportunities Committee to ensure that they are free to communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently released BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about student politics, which described the Conservatives as weirdoes and neo-Nazis.
The show featured alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who drove a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had a silver-headed staff.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are being treated as "scapegoats" because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," while OUCA President-elect Stephanie Cherill, 19, says there has been a deterioration in JCR members' attitude toward people to the right of the center.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I started in September 1986, 18 years old and paralyzingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most outrageous.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse to award an honorary degree to former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in higher education funding.
Even Stalinists would tremble at the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when new students were meeting with each other and with professors, I got a taste of the icing that was to come.
I have found that not only do professors silently approve of teasing conservative pupils, but they are also happy to participate.
The policy of mining strikes, privatization and the government's opposition to anti-apartheid sanctions in South Africa was brought to the wood-panelled workshops.
My first lecture was about translating 18th-century French text into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like cake dough, was very bile-shaped.
"Do the Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
Tears came into my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy with social matters," Professor Pitt growled.
Devastated, I returned to my room.
At school dinner, I was sitting alone when I felt a slight pat on the shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
I'm afraid that's the way it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even worse for you.
Most Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.
Later, at a local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics and economics who (ironically) went to Eton said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students were noting with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" asked one.
They beat each other up, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people just after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labour mp and suppress my natural tendencies?
Three years before me developed as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being Conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He was almost not there.
He hated the place for its provincialism and pettiness, and for its inclination towards a Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997 he took up a professor position at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents' house in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a city of dreamy moods.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His wet eyes were gloomy.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a Conservative Party supporter, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week, during class, when another history professor declared in complete seriousness that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing with shame inside, I confessed that my "parents brainwashed me" and called them "old fools."
The relief was short-lived.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was hammered by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's newspaper every week.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snot-nosed wieer.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subjected to such intimidation and poison in an educational institution.
More tragicly, it was Oxford, from which not only did 14 Conservative prime ministers emerge, but which to this day also hides behind the uneased reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion", which opened this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which features more than 130 models of top fashion created by his studio over the last 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist, but without his revered clients it could not have been written.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which runs until March 3, is teeous with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Princess Mary-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino displays these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to an idol of the international "bohemian elite."
There's nothing wrong with being liked by royalty.
"At least they don't put a cigarette in your great carpet, like some gorgeous pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains "Heini's" ex-wife Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And he's still a star."
Valeria Mazz performs Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazz does not forget the charisma of the designer.
"It's been many years since we went to his house for dinner after a show in Piazza di Spagna, Rome.
There were 20 of us, and among us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, the decorations, the food, the music, everything, he was bright and felt his spirit.
It made everyone who was invited feel important and loved," recalls the top model who started working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
The Parade of Nobility
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of truly re-returned love.
He loves people with good ediments and better degrees, and they love him.
One of somerset house's galleries has been rebuilt into a distinctive 70-metre-long passage that offers a role-change: a visitor turns into a model and marches through the passage to watch the "audience" of dreams wearing Valentino's masterpieces as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "The Night." or a coat of wool and fur that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg shine in the audience of manneeks.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "you can't forget him".
"I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, shirts, a gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to others because of his femininity and great love for women, because it underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, brighten a lot and give a "sparkle" to his face.
The proportions are perfect."
Even princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget how she first wore Valentino.
Growing up and living in Italy, she longed to be of age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
Finally, it arrived in the late 1990s.
"I bought my first Valentino dress to celebrate at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a ruffle skirt, a ruffle bodr and a strapless top.
It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is lax about fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life unfolds between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has stored the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because dresses aren't just dresses, they're also a set of memories they have in them".
The "King" of Fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is marie-chantal miller's wedding dress from her wedding to Paul the Greek in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to create this ivory silk dress with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a 4 1/2-meter-long swil.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents the landmark of the peak fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from high society".
Valentino dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoir-être" is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (italy's highest honour), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and decorated with the Order of the Legion of Honor accumulates as many tributes as any of his clients' husbands.
"My attention has always been drawn to his chosenness, calmness, groomed and perfect appearance," admits Princess d'Arenberg.
"The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
It was impeccable, time left no trace of it."
When the princess says so...
Toughest craft in the world: the serite carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano area
For four euros, porters in the Indonesian volcano area gamble with their lives and health as they carry 70 kilos of serpt down steep stone paths.
There are people for who have hell to do their job, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case with Ant Wijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living by conquering sieve from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, it has to frub every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and, when in contact with the air, it enters a solid state.
After chopping out large blocks of carbon, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
It's only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises 2,386 metres, but it takes exhausted porters over 40 minutes to climb up at the turtle's pace as they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so they don't slip and collapse into the abyss.
They know that any stumble could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sera level they extract
When they're up there, they make their way past the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and wearily carry heavy baskets to the weight that the mining company placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
Pt Candi Ngrimbi has been a volcano-owned company since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of serage.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as the mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for making matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for sugar bleaching.
"Because we normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and he is devastated at the end, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) a day.
While this seems like a negligible sum for such an inhuman effort, it's three times what he would have earned in the field.
"The daily wages of the miners here are very high. For example, coffee collection is charged at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day, and a fortnight's salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a mason.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as the serage: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sieve has already begun to take its toll on him, despite his face being protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases escaping from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to be working for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than decent English.
This likeable and intelligent young man besaded with fate could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist at the hotel, and instead does the job of porter.
She shares a dirty wooden shack with other porters and wakes up at 2am every day as the raw continues to rise at night and her characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto carats into the crater and illuminates his way through a small flashlight attached to his helmet and buys it himself with his money.
About 400 carriers carry a basket of with the same weight from the bottom of the crater on the shoulders
Although the company has high incomes, it has not skimmed or provided any equipment to carriers working on their own and with such effort to save costs.
In fact, they don't even get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) in the photography surcharge, which, along with a 15,000 rupee (1.2 euros) ticket, is collected by nature park rangers from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for cattle, not people," says Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old porter who has worked at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can work as long as possible because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sieger burns the throat and stings in the eyes when the wind unexpectedly turns and traps the miners in the dense fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners are so hard that none of them complain that they suffer from serious illnesses... however, this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, balancing his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues climb 15 tons of carbon in a volcano, which three trucks then carry down a steep road between the buns to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik declares, opening his mouth wide, missing several teeth.
Of his five sons, the eldest, in his 30s, also earns money mining for siei.
Time passes, but the permanent misery of one of the world's heaviest crafts persists from generation to generation - crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame having no children for their careers, stress and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot. Let us fulfill our civic duty and create a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but still - or perhaps that's why - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local allusions like "we're going to put a chick in the oven" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a funny way with this ad.
The agency's artistic director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people do "their civic duty."
"This is strictly an Internet thing, so it must have been fun and funny.
It's this country's biggest problem.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt that this was a topic that we had to touch.
We knew the government was trying a lot of things like spreading perfumes with pheromones or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like the composition of rap, to solve this problem."
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take this lightly is the Singapore government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
However, all these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for its representatives' conservatism and strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate for population stratification is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded 2, which is considered a recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Division of the National Population Office, says it's because of "better education" and a "wider range of career opportunities."
"This means that people have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, it's not just marriage and family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing the number of unmarried people and to procrastination and procreation. The result is a reduction in singapore's birth rate.
While there have been efforts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against the decline in population, this has caused resentment among locals.
Some Singapore websites show undisgudisgued xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who have been criticized for keeping wages low and making little effort at integration.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons singapore's ruling party recorded its worst election result since independence last year.
After the elections, efforts were made to solve the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in the birth rate has known implications for national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending, and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and have had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, ceo of el developers, says their "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger houses.
"They are more popular by being sold days to weeks faster than larger-area houses.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow."
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited to wanting to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules could aim to increase the nation's birth rate, an interview with Singaporeans working in the city center's financial district suggests that they will not have much effect.
"People are still stressed, houses are expensive, as is education, which is why many people put it off," says the young official.
"Let the others have children.
But for me, it's important to rely on my own money and time," says another, in his 20s, a young man.
Both men and women cite career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how hard the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is singaporeans who have the final say on starting a family anyway.
What is private offline is both private and online
privacy.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something of a personal nature or "an area of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption."
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone in normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the age of 10 and 15 who are frequent internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be 'something entirely their own' on a personal level and a 'username and password' when it came to social networks.
"I wouldn't publish my biggest secret," says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he's had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," she says.
"I put nice pictures or pictures of us playing at the FB.
I'm also talking to friends there.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine or a photo that mocked someone," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to post obscene photos, photos of naked people or photos of crimes, or to write degrading or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on the FB and his nine Twitter followers.
Most are related.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I set up a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone's going to answer me, I'm just putting them in," he adds.
"Social media is fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from a stranger.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone unknown to him.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and admits to not knowing 20 people on his friends list.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them were following him or ask him for an address or phone number.
"If they press me or demand it from me, I'll simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José logged on to Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
This boy is no stranger to experience with what is now called cyberbullying.
"A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was," he confirms.
According to Jose, the victim didn't log out of the account.
"She just activated her private mode."
It then explains a series of steps to set up your account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post photos of acquaintances in awkward or awkward situations.
"Of course I would if I didn't like it or just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and Education and Teaching graduate, believe that in order for children and adolescents to navigate social media correctly, they need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform.
It states that: "The Internet was created as a means of seeking information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a yale graduate student and author of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic "because we ask them to recognize what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet ready for it."
Also, to be - as far as the surroundings are concerned - considerate, at a time when what they desire most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Furthermore, Marrielos Porras lists some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post a picture of you the way you posted a friend's?
You know what other people post about you?
When you refer to people in party photos, have you asked these people for permission?
And one more: Does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
The next point is to make them realize that they have to behave in the same way as outside the Internet.
They're the same rules.
"You follow respect, morality and other principles outside the Internet, and it should be the same on social media," he says.
supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-grade teacher and educational advisor, explains that it is essential that parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If they understand every sneakiness, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences that opening an account on the Internet can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or posted," he says.
Guardiola believes it is crucial to remind children of the traditional "don't talk to strangers" rule.
South American Summit Ends and Limy Statement Not Published
Peru's sixth Presidential Union of South American Nations (Unasur) summit ended today without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was reportedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth Unasur Meeting of Heads of State or Government, but representatives of both the Foreign Ministry and the Presidential Office, who initially set out to publish the document after the summit, said it would be published later on the Peruvian government's website.
They also stated that the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room without sound with the message " confidential meeting, audio transmission not forbidden".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press officers of some governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian speaker.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, which provoked a backlash from hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Later, peru's presidential office sent an email to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but it is only a statement from President Humala, not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third Summit of South American and Arab Countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA), and even on this occasion the originally promised Declaration from Lima was not published, although it was eagerly demanded by the press.
On the official ASPA website, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that all journalists were broadcast, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended, inter alia, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which resolves the dispute over the border between the two countries.
Peru's President Ollanta Humala and Chile's President Sebastián Piñera met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing arguments from both sides on Monday to discuss lima's dispute against Santiago.
"We will submit and execute the judgment that will resolve the dispute that we are hearing in this international court today," President Humala and his Chilean counterpart said.
"Chile was, is and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful dispute resolution, conventions and international courts," Piñera added, greeting President Humala with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the decision of the International Court of Justice was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogotá Pact this week, expressing submission to the judgments of the international court that ruled on the maritime border with Nicaragua, and Colombia deemed the decision completely flawed.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was charged with opening his morning speeches and ending the Summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read a final document informing that 16 agreements had been adopted and 31 projects between South American countries had been scheduled, with $17 billion in investment.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR member countries would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are extended."
He said actions were being encouraged to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) is not supposed to have a winning nature, but to serve to expand our productivity and show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport links of various parts of South America, especially rural and border areas...so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties," peruvian president said in a read-out speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects concern Peru and the transverse iss of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to a better connection with Ecuador, but did not give further details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return her to the Union of South American Nations", from which she is currently excluded.
Another issue highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful region that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to respectfully discuss the Ruling of the International Court of Justice on the maritime border dispute, which is being challenged by Bogota.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all the solutions, none of which are excluded, nor the nicaragua treaty, which would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of president Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, EU defence ministers met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
UNASUR members include Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, really must learn from Europe."
Correa, who was attending the sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV Perú that Europeans "killed each other in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically one country."
In this sense, he defended the project for the creation of South American citizenship, which unasur member countries support.
"There needs to be a free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already underway among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that want to return us to the past," he said.
Among other things, ecuador's president has said that he agrees to regroup the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that the influence of Anglo-Saxon states is reduced and that those who signed the San Jose Human Rights Pact are taken into account.
"Those at the forefront never commit to anything, and we South Americans sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is funded by the United States," he said, referring to political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret the decision because he had not betrayed his principles and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He added that at the time there were "reasonable suspicions that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be questioned on Swedish territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish legislation allows for the conduct of an interrogation by videoconferencing call that could take place from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental condition threatens to deteriorate because he is locked in a small space with no possibility of moving in the fresh air.
That would harm everyone's health," he added.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London under a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks had been held with London to resolve the WikiLeaks founder's imprisonment.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there were constant talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is conducting a series of proceedings at various European instances," he said.
He said that "if the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over."
And if Sweden listens to Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as the legislation there allows, and as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be over tomorrow."
Correa used the situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, explaining that he certainly does not tolerate "underpermeasure, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
The greatest enemies of a free press are not us, the evil and perverted politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, he expressed his joy that neither such journalists, "nor bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie control Ecuador," and said that if re-elected, "he would continue to make changes in the right direction and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported paraguay's decision to maintain its veto of Unasur membership at least until its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'éthomism shrouded in legality" because, in fact, it has "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy."
In addition, the Ecuadorian President said he considered it "entirely appropriate" for his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, in the afterthemic ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which ruled in nicaragua's favor.
The sentence is currently not accepted.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed widely in order to overcome them and to be able to move forward."
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute, which he is dealing with in the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries commit to adopting a judgment, however harsh it may be."
Regarding the possibility of running in Ecuador's next presidential election to run for a third term, he noted that he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he lost the election in February 2013, he would retire from public life.
"Personally, I have never been interested in power, but such unfair situations as socioeconomic poverty in Ecuador can only be remedied by political power.
My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept that responsibility," he said.
"If I had won, it would have been my last term as president, and then I would have left politics.
If we lose, I'll have the same thing.
I've made my decision," he said.
Correa also mentioned venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's new medical treatment in Cuba.
"I have just spoken to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says that President Chávez has gone for planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
This is not a relapse in the president's state of health," he explained.
The Head of State of Ecuador today attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are now the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizi was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like I was struck by lightning," he says, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor tried to "soften a little", but apparently without success.
The boy kept it a secret from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to learn about it. And with such dedica, he's already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the earliest hiv patients at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he joined in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) clinic didn't say goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and weakened the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since AIDS has occurred in the world, or at least since the first documented cases, "it is a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who begins treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, noting that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Andrade Villanueva, an infectologist and HIV/AIDS specialist, explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008 AIDS has not been a death sentence, but that survival and full life depend on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, with those who do not use drugs better off: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years, and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that someone diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "live without problems until the age of 75 while adhering to treatment," the doctor explained in an interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality rates have declined significantly in recent years, and in mexico's case, the number of people who have died from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (yearbook of the United Nations Joint Program on HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 so far this May. However, since 2005, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured.
- Why do people continue to die from the disease?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happens in our hospital.
We haven't used up our drug supply in at least the last 12 years. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the condition of the disease, i.e. in the late stages of the disease."
It adds a compelling figure: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection has already manifested itself. All we need to do to be able to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore, on a large scale, tests to detect the disease must be offered to all those who apply for it'.
His proposal is consistent with specialists and officials from the State Aids Prevention Council in Jalisco, as well as patients like Fabrizio, who came to get tests in a private lab just because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he's already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma. , cancer, which is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather have fun three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for the better, I eat healthily, I exercise, I take medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but responsibly, I look out for myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has accepted a call to share his experiences with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony today as part of World AIDS Day.
"Let them get tested. If they took a risk, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, it's better. And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message sums up the motto of the battle against AIDS this year, 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who is investigating information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "condoms have actually increased, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is a very good thing, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want it for?" is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees, and medical staff that teens want to avoid, says a reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution. Don't let condoms be just behind counters, but the 100 can be found in dispensers in public toilets, places where young people often go.
"It's not promiscuity support.
Nor is it about "paying for beer and a motel," as Governor Emilio González responded to a question about whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
There's no such thing as sexuality. It's best to make condoms available to those who are already leading a sex life," he said.
Key numbers in Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This is the fourth place in new and identified AIDS cases in Mexico and 13th in HIV-related cases.
92% of infections take place through sexual channels, 6% bloodstream y 2% perinate.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people who are unaware of the disease per registered case.
The ruling, approved by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Mexico, which does not recognize grupo Vitro's debt restructuring, sets a bad precedent for any national enterprise with branches in a neighboring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, the procedures for restructuring the firms that allow Mexican law do not seem to apply in the land of stripes and stars, despite international agreements.
In practice, the approval of a judgment handed down on June 15 last year by Judge Harlin Hale in the Bankruptcy Court of North Texas leaves Mexican firms unass than defending against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the El Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico's main glass producer to appeal to the United States Supreme Court on three counts of irregularity.
To begin with, while the judge in this case argues that creditors should abide by U.S. insolvency law, the New Orleans-based Fifth District Court of Appeals says the main procedure is for bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it would point to ignorance of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinationals.
In essence, a United Nations model law for the unification of international trade law was created for this purpose, which determines the American Law Institute by arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the vote of the branches in the internal corporate structure, where the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority would not have been achieved to approve the restructuring.
However, this possibility is accepted by Mexican law.
The fact is that Vitro's case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose in-house debts were vouched for by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
Moreover, it is true that even after the votes of the branches were deducted, the creditors - who opposed Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not achieve a majority.
They would have reached about 45 percent to 37 in the vote.
This figure is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
In the meantime, Gonzáze Sady's family firm will appeal for reassessment directly to the Court of Appeal for the assessment to be carried out with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since only three originally voted.
If he fails here, he will seek a review of the process by a higher instance as an appeal, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
The serious thing about the case is that the court omited a document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae unit detailing Vitro's bankruptcy law procedure, pointing out that the company had made it easier by moving towards agreements signed by both countries to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the United States Insolvency Act.
Moreover, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, rules designed for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
Unnoticed, a mexican aviation union complaint against the company's former owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who had been accused of fraud, had been on the table for several months, and, according to the pilots' union, the vessel had already overshot.
The instance, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, accusing it of obstruction in achieving justice.
According to it, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic on a transaction carried out by that entrepreneur, in which it withdrew 198 million pesos from IXE of Fideikomis F/589 on behalf of Mexican Aviation.
The funds were probably directed towards the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As is known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart siege
A group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens gathered at the Universidad de Caribe over the weekend to prevent the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Kankún.
We are talking, as we know, about a huge commercial and distribution centre with products from a "big wall country" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Previously, the Canacintra (Cámara Nacional de la Industria de Transformación) was able to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental site that would partially devastate protected areas and which is the origin of all resistance to industry.
End of ACTA matter
The Senate's request, which was ignored by the government and which demanded an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement in Japan, known by the English acronym ACTA, according to the Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial, has been left up to date.
As is well known, this happened despite the Senate itself ruling out the possibility of treating it as a threat to freedom of expression on social media.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not affect short-term debts, homex, a development company, is marketing investment certificates worth 500 million pesos.
This series is the first of four identical ones that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival is born
The merger of leading IT companies such as NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet has spawned an association called Competival, which will aim to market software services in Central and South America.
Business investment will exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: " Basketball was my life"
Basketball globetrotter Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world thanks to it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was passionate about the sport for more than 60 years before he suffered a stroke in 2008, whether as a junior player, BSN national basketball player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón national basketball league, or president of the Puerto Rican Basketball Federation.
"I've played a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, general manager of the national team, and chairman of the federation," Reyes recalled during a visit to primera hora reporters at his home in Bayamón, where he has lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his statement.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest emotion of all, he guards those that commemorate his time in Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or team owner.
"Those were my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to participate in eight championships with the Los Vaqueros team since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held between 1971 and 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
That's when "Cuco" Ortiz took over the team, who was an excellent leader," Reyes said.
"I remember Gene Bartow, who was previously a coach here and was at the University of Alabama at Birmingham at the time, said to me, "I've got a 6-footer for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy brings Bayamon victory in the championship, Gausse will contribute to the next."
He enjoyed the championship, when Gaussus played for los Vaqueros, but only remotely, since in 1988 he was already president of the basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself fully to his functions and enjoy Mincy's place on the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in the 1989 Olympic qualifying match in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, but we should have had bronze had it not been for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final toss," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who beat Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and we beat a United States team that was pretty similar to the one that took away our bronze at the World Cup.
The team not only had Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also there were youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have had the perfect composition but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy was the team from the 1995 Olympic qualifier in Neuquén, Argentina.
With roster players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended for the Pan American Games at Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all predictions.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was Piculín Ortiz, no doubt.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved the same results at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his time in different leagues where he played.
Who was Puerto Rica's best coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work very much among the young.
Which of your federation successes do you consider to be the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, and that in the early 1990s the BSN National League had up to 17 teams in one season.
What didn't you have time to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, like dividing youth categories by region.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in mandatory certificates and courses for coaches, assistant referees and referees.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music the most, watch YouTube videos of music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, is world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the TELEVISION series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TELEVISION series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas series, died Friday afternoon of cancer-related complications, according to an official family announcement provided to the Associated Press by Dallas Production Company Warner Bros.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he again played the iconic role he loved the most," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was his wife's representative in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital," said her agent, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
In the years before dallas aired, Hagman shot to fame on television as a decent guy in the light-cut comedy I Dream of Jeannie, broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (genie), played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to his home to live together.
He was also the protagonist in two comedies that aired only briefly, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His performances in films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterful performance in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R. that took him to the star's peak.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who ShotEjar?", which was supposed to raise expectations for an emotional episode in which Hangman's character is nearly murdered, caused not only a huge amount of speculation from viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in sooth offices.
This also helped this episode set a ratings record.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers. Dallas became the second most-watched entertainment show in history after mash ended in 1983, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot at by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and then he threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, a greedy greedy man with a charismatic smile: a sly businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, to be locked up in rehab.
"I know what I want J.R. to have on his tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable to the millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Filming of five episodes of season two has already been completed and the sixth has just been filmed," the network reported.
In the immediate aftermath of Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would proceed.
The Fort Worth, Texas native was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who has stared in classic works such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on stage in New York, then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met a young Swedish designer, Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published an autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt anyone or harm them in any way," he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began promoting organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to help fearful patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet them when they go into surgery and after that," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it's going to be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in various campaigns.
A course that explores the "end of the world" begins
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take an end-of-the-world course this semester, he knew it was an irresistible attraction: The end of the "long" Mayan calendar, due on December 21, was seeded by many as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was ahead of him in the next few months: Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a budget gap that some call "debt Armageddon," and a growing conflict that has drawn Israel into it, a place where Christians theorizing about the end of the world say the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When you think about what's going on in the world today, like we have 30 days left, it's a really good time.
And remember, bad means good for apocalyptic-minded people.
And he's not the only professor offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, assistant professor Barry Vacker is organizing a course called "Means, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics like nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We discuss why these ideas expand over time," he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that govern certain human behaviors.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic themes and exploring how they differ from real-life examples.
"I tried to inform students about what was possible, probable, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, assistant professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to organize a course simply called The End of the World.
"We're not joining "2012" because we're always counting on the possibility of holding a course again in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "impending doom", students have to study, create projects and take final exams.
Penn State will hold its final exam on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "until the evening of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"It stretched into two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which enrolled on March 35.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we received e-mail questions about whether there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," bridgid Robinson, 23, a religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, said at Rutgers University in Camden.
Thus, apocalyptic, secular, or religious sentiment is only a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he's seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of an hour where it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no interviewed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in a date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prediction, and we're resuting it in some way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never foresched the end of the world; it's just a key item on the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings with predictions about the end of the world.
The internet has caused this speculation to flourish.
"People don't think about it elsewhere," he said.
This is done in the vast majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is a lecturer in the Philippines this year, was quick to answer the question of whether he knew of a "end-of-the-world" course there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at an exception to the highest office.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will end.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several said they intended to go to the "end of the world" ceremony.
"I think I'm going to call some of my friends and have a laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
