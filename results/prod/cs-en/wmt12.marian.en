Parliament did not support the amendment to the liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine's parliament today rejected a proposal to repeal a section under the amendment to the Penal Code on the basis of which the opposition leader, Yuliya Tymoshenko, was convicted.
An amendment to open the way for the liberation of the jailed ex-PM was rejected by MPs at the second reading of the proposal to alleviate the sentences for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for entering into an allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia to purchase natural gas.
The verdict is not final; the court is due to hear the appeal of the convicted man in December.
Tymoshenko calls the ruling a political vendetta of the regime, the suspicion of bias in the court has also sparked the trial in the West.
The motion to drop section 365 on the basis of which the ex-PM was convicted of the Penal Code was supported by 147 deputies in the vote.
It required 226 votes to be approved.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, which has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it is over.
All the remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the county, the election will be won by the Islamists, but the question is whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to the customary Sharia law, and we already have some idea about it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as a hand is being scheled for theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, any apostates from the faith are waiting for execution, and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, a company consisting of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
There will be order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would certainly not want.
But our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best, and it would most likely not suit the aforementioned Libyans for a change.
In fact, it's a wonder that the Islamic fighters took the aid from infidel dogs.
The only excuse is that, from their point of view, it was not the American general who was driving NATO raids, but by Alah, whose greatness they celebrated in every hilarious intervention.
So when the victors are sought in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We took part in the shootout, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of the dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not buy Libya militarily.
That leaves the locals with the expulsion of the "croars."
But will they have, without the occupation of the oil company, for a kiss of Libya's black gold?
They may well not be, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless, of that, let the followers of the Sharia law pass it.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France has come to the attention of investors and the rest of Europe
The statistical whirlwind swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated quarter-on-nation, Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is now breaking records.
Investors are no longer looking at just Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The eurozone's statistical offices, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have released preliminary estimates of the economy's third-quarter economic development.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, the two countries adjusted the second quarter data, in which Germany, in addition to the expected, in addition to the 0.3% growth, instead of the original 0.1%), but France said it had emerged in a slight 0.1% decline (the original data indicated a stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
Quarterly, however, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistical Office, confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic performance growth.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
Key developments:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in the first-time way.
The German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonally converted data.
The euro area and European Union's economies grew by 0.2 percent between the previous quarter and the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical borders.
The problems are also starting to be felt by Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Yields for Czech 10-year bonds are holding below 4%, even as the situation in the region is getting worse.
There are voices from Germany that the ECB should be a creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate their 200 million promotion
The football team has mastered the toughest task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and Petr Jiráček's beautiful goal, she won 1-0.
Czech football, even with a large portion of luck in the second half, defended a luxurious lead from the home leg and will not miss the European Championship again.
IHNED.cz watched the postseason match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great deal of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, also thanks to their home game in the end, the great Czech and the hero Jiráček won happily 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate their progress to the European Championships.
The Montenegrin, due to the precise defence of the Czech Republic, did not get under pressure until the second half.
The match's smoscatters were Damjanovic and Vučinič, who scorched two big chances.
Even thanks to the brilliant Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and a reward of around 200 million crowns will be added to the Czech national football register.
Ever since the opening minutes, there was a lot of fighting football.
Both teams found it difficult to get involved in the combination and were played mostly around the halfway line.
The pressure of the home footballers did not come in the first half either, as the Czech defence kicked long pitches for the defence to be meticulously averted.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country's nuclear program.
Created a living shield
Several hundred college students created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their country's support for their country's nuclear program ahead of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed in front of the premises at noon on Tuesday and then cheated the death of the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, formed a living shield on Tuesday around Isfahan's nuclear nuclear technology center, which is processing uranium.
They are thus showing that they are ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its recent report that Iran did not appear to have stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Ishahan nuclear facility and then proclare out to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack designed to cripple Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, the target, in addition to the Ishpahanic center, would also be to the Natanz facility in which the uranium is enriched.
The menu of an obesstre child: does not eat and dine sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with an oversized weight of 9 per cent of schoolchildren and 5 per cent of children obescence.
At the same time, the obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Once again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of a person to grow up in the environment and the patterns he is surrounded by.
For example, on tables of obeséc children, sausages appear up to half as often as they are in families of children with a normal weight.
Fried fries had a dinner day before the research associated with an awareness-raising event called Obesity is no coincidence of more than 19 percent of the obesse.
Fats are also not used to play sports in fatty families, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children said that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey among 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last year's school year and was attended by nearly 900 primary school children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of the Obesity event, which is not a coincidence supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4th to 8th grades have joined the project.
Meanwhile, the right eating and plenty of movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes the dramatically rising number of overweight or even obese children.
"Only half of those polled, for example, said that they were eaten five times a day in breakfast-svach-a lunch-swim-scheme mode, which is one of the basic prerequisites for the right nutrition," reads one of the survey's results.
No breakfast and dinner in the evening
Experts point out that relative details are also essential for healthy development, including regular family breakfast time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren's families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding that a tenth of households would not have a cinging at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy fries are much more likely to be consumed in the families of obesiténae.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary lemonades every day (70 per cent).
While more than 40 percent of surveyed children regularly play sports, the result was less than half - 15 per cent - for their parents.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own diet from the options on offer according to their own taste and opinion.
"The eating preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from an ideal in terms of a healthy diet."
Among their favourite dishes are a lot of flour, fleshy and sugary dishes.
"The big popularity of sugary sodas is particularly alarming," the final report on the survey reads.
For lunch as a main meal, pasta triumphed just over the poultry.
But the children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and lunching vegetable dishes is also low.
A tendency to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"For the survey participants' control group, who completed a questionnaire after the end of the outreach lecture Obesity is no coincidence, there has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of a healthy diet in a number of cases," the project's results read.
It was striking, for example, for sugary soda, where more children would start to prefer plain water.
Children were also much more likely to tickle poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire and would cut back on sugary foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, pros say
In the introductory article about how stylists are taught, I complained a bit about the fact that there was a lot already in the opening hours.
I had no idea what was coming next.
Lectures by three pros in the field, dressing up problematic characters, and a seminar on how it goes on set.
And it gets worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "trodden."
This time, the director, Alice and I discussed (there's not a single boy in the class) to dress up a woman who doesn't have a perfectly swayed figure.
And the vast majority are.
Someone has a short neck, some have a boyish figure with no proper curves, and some are overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften the broad shoulders, extend the neck or deliver the necessary curves.
We were given tips on how to make out for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. the larger breasts and hips and narrow waist, to highlight the character nicely while not dressing the woman too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and the hips is such that skirts or pants really don't fit, then it's worth having at least one of those tailored sticks.
You certainly won't regret it, because perfectly fitted clothes are priceless.
You will feel much better in a tailored skirt than in one that keeps moving, displaing, removing at the waist and the like.
The boy's character, in turn, can afford to wear clothing with algae, apps, embroidery or pick-picking.
Of course, there are many of these information and character types, so I'm glad to have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still worried that given the homework assignment, it's up to the thing.
Each of the Course Courseists has been given an assigned celebrity to devise two outfits: day and evening.
We have to take into account the current look, the fashion style of the personality and the type of character.
I'll be "dry" Mirand Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
I cheer in mind, for me personally, certainly better than the kind of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has gained perhaps a hundred pounds recently (take, please, an exaggeration), or a young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut our clothes out of magazines or search the internet and print them out and then process graphically.
The Moodboard, as the result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to the graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic side of the styling is important as well.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific entries, such as trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told by the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But that's not until Sunday.
Stylist must have a general overview
Saturday's lecture packed with information about the types of characters was spared by three industry-leafed guests.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And a skilful stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is crucial in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you want originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a cloak, but you can also dress it on your bare body, put on pumps and take pictures of it as a dress.
Or just roll up the sleeves or colllaves and the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he emphasized.
But I praised the following advice the most: "You need to know the rules perfectly for your work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said James.
Finally, I can see why we are crushing down all the lessons, what to combine with, what to do with what, why, when we sometimes see something different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have many more clothing options ready than they can take pictures.
So with the fashion story, which will have ten pages (that is, ten outfits), I have to be prepared to "cake" at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing photo looks and works in combination with other pieces at times quite different from the reality.
So we have to factor in creating the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up to half the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorný.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miraculous singer, but image and marketing have made her a world-class star.
In the Czech Republic, so far, access to the use of stylists' services is rather cool.
Even familiar faces sometimes find him unnecessary (it is enough that I can do something, the way I look at it, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone already has a styling made by us, then we're supposed to be counting on dictating to us a completely different (smalare) size than they really have.
Then we have to google and see if the tabloids were written about the fact that the celebrity had lost/did and the like.
Both Honza and Mario were told on Sunday that it was not enough for the stylist to navigate fashion and be able to put together an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Being able to judge people, not to be under the boro, to stand up for your opinion.
"If you're ordered by a manager to sort her wardrobe and add nice pieces to her, you can't throw out her the whole closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things that you praise and recommend what they can be worn for," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what the so-called "placovka" or set bag must contain.
It's the one you turn around the waist and you carry all the necessary propriety.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, a roller for hair or closing pins, there is also a nylon thread (with which the stylist helps himself to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips to clip the back of the outfit, if it's bigger (the pin or other clamps are not allowed, they'll damage the garment), or the sewage.
So we wouldn't just listen to, but they've also practically tried something, we've learned how to get your shoe right.
Even with a photo shoot in the studio where the surface is flat, the sole could be damaged, let alone outdoors.
So we glue and glue.
We mustn't touch the shoes with scissors, lest they accidentally get damaged.
So it takes really skill.
Mario was pleased when he complimented my creation without reservation.
The aforementioned skill is really not my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we've heard on the second weekend of the course.
It's becoming more and more clear to me that it's not a walk in the park to styling at the professional level, no matter what anyone says.
In Need for Speed: The Run, races are across America.
Review
The initially carefree ride turns into a routine morning ride on the shift, because of a series of completely unnecessary lag errors.
The ambition has been largely fulfilled, but it is no avail it to no one that apparently wanted to do anything extra.
The new episode subtitled The Run attraed high expectations before the release.
He promised to move the age-old Need for Speed racing series again in a new direction, and from playable previews he appeared to be a game that might not only be in the number in the genre of action racing.
We were also curious to see how the inserted passages would turn out, in which the main character would get out of the car and run his own way.
But, as is customary with the NFS series, much is a bit different in the end than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole draws down some unnecessary errors that have been appearing in the series for more or less several years.
So it's not really even mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are inducted into a story whose main character, Jack, has some personal problems and is offered as a solution to participate in an illegal race across America.
You get behind the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco and your job is to arrive first in New York.
The idea entails some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is run on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
It doesn't make you feel for a moment that the game would offer the same thing all the time.
In addition, some of the backgrounds are very pretty to look at, even though the technical level of the graphics matches the previous episodes of the series.
So it's not a big deal.
But driving across deserts, autumn country or high in the snowy mountains feels visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are bright with some uncharacteristic element from time to time.
In the desert, for example, you get involved in a sandstorm that reduces visibility considerably.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be careful not to be filled by an avalanche.
Alongside this, the individual races are quite well in a row.
There are only a few types of them, but that's enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of rivals (basically a classic race), then catch up again (the classic duel with the stopwatch) and then there is a duel with a single opponent waiting for you.
The police will also get involved from time to time, making your whole effort even further unpleasant.
The new feature is the passages outside the car.
It's more just about the kind of interactive animation that Jack usually flees from someone and you have to help him do it by printing the right buttons in the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
But it is surprising that there are far fewer passages in the game than you would expect (specifically perhaps only three).
In the end, however, it is to the benefit of the cause, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and, in the context of the above, thus ranks among the elements that make the game better.
The driving model is in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means it's definitely not something these days, but you can't say it's a shat way.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more acclainated racing is still quite comfortable with the driving model here, even though we could find a better one with the competition.
So far, so far, everything is in perfect order.
But problems are starting to emerge after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is no longer very well.
We don't expect a game of this type to count the complex deformities and collision, but when you have no idea before any crash into any object how your car will behave, then I guess everything isn't quite right.
Typically, when you're overtaking or passing cars in normal traffic, you sometimes just easily get on each other, but at other times in an almost identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even attack the right.
Thanks to the reboot system, it doesn't particularly matter, but it will make you special.
The rebootes are designed so that if you smash or go far out of the track, the game will throw you back to the last clue point on the track.
But there are only five reboots available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
It is, therefore, more of a tool in case something goes wrong than being able to rely on them in a voice.
Sometimes, however, even the reboots don't help, solving them only by having to memorate the race section.
The big a-mon of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some corners need to be driven in a specific way, otherwise you simply won't fit into them.
Other times, you will meet "civil" cars at that location always in the same configuration whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It will annoy especially in situations where you see the opponent in front of you driving between the two oncoming cars, while when you arrive there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or slow them down.
It doesn't matter when you reach them, because it's "counted" so that the situation always occurred just in front of your nose.
The rivals also have another advantage.
Throughout the game, you will come across several places where, again, regardless of the time, you will always be overtomed by the same opponent in the same place.
It's the most hit at the end of the game on a long bridge where you're driving in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously get there in front of you at any price.
When he rides in front of you, it worsens your insight into oncoming cars, so you probably get a nice bit of a few times there at first.
It is possible to understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fuelled, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably quickly disgust you.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and, in places, action so much that sometimes you literally can't watch where what freshees.
And it doesn't really matter whether it's credited with a concept with fifty unique tracks, gearing up races so that boredom doesn't stand a chance or anything else.
The unconventional idea is to replace cars during the races.
You have to be careful of the gas stations by the roads, because that's where you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you can do with what you have right now.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for urban areas, heavy American highway jumps and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example, on winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are the races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points in your profile, which is common to challenges and a story.
For obtaining a higher driver level, different items are unlocked: from the cars to the background for the profile.
It is also again linked to the online feature of Autolog, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and provides additional community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (so be) where you are in the dark by the rails (by).
The speedometer is flashing the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (be) and in that, a subway train will come in from behind and uncompromisingly scraps you.
The newsroom will thus last for us for a few more days discussing whether no one really thought a little bit when creating the game, or whether the authors think of us as really such a big jerk.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and, in a few cases, even great.
It frofuses by dropping imaging in some of the more tense moments, in some cases quite tragically.
But it mainly concerns crashes with more participants, when smooth imaging would no longer do you any good.
The sound side is fine, and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to appeal to the widest range of rather younger audiences, the soundtrack from the category "every dog a different village" was created, but it can be assumed that, to listen to music, it is probably not anyone who will buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is thus highly embarrassed.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
But this is how the game feels unfinished.
Fun is certainly fine, but be prepared to be slam-blag in the eye by the power of the airport headlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for negativeists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly upset the balance between the institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a tough war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to stabilise a bit, calm down and before all the players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Ambassador to the European Union, Milan Vicen, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She took seriously of her motto "Increasonably and understandably about Europe" as to how she took her motto, in the first part of the lecture, when she was able to describe the various EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and comprehensible way that a number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University could envy her.
Viceen also praised the work of the new Permanent European Council President Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first there was criticism that it was bland, that he was a grey official, that he could perform no role, and I have to say that it took everyone's breath away that he had done well with the role."
"He is a man who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate excellently with them, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: 'Who is this European Union? What telephone number should I call for?', that is, as an important step to unifying and readmiliability of the EU's policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from the whet syin
Vice has also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived in, lives and will live in the near future.
The previous year's Czech Presidency called it a success.
The Czechs addressed the incoming financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or held a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time was described as a major negative, which very badly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the ambassador, "really a rush" was not only the Presidency, but also the ensuing financial crisis, which is still being addressed today.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is being significantly complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slim and austerity, which sectors will be preferred, which countries will be supported more and which are less likely to be on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: 'Abringing Europe in a clear way'.
"I really don't like ugly shortcuts, foreign words, lanches that no one understands.
How is the citizen to understand that there really are not curved or round cucumbers in Brussels, bananas of different size, or that we really have to be banned from the whey."
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and to bring more Czechs to the European institutions.
We are in for a multi-speed Europe
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for Eurosceptics and people who take more notice of the negative rather than the positive aspects of the matter.
Moreover, it regrets the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
A lot of factors are to blame, she says, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak is coming, the Frenchman next to me will say, "Hey, what are your Visegrad Four coming together?" and he doesn't look at it enthusiastically at all."
In the future, according to Vicen, the Union is mainly awaited by the new tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
He sees as very real the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European federation."
"We have eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have the space of Schengen, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries they wanted and the ones they didn't want to, that they were standing by."
"There will be more of those institutes and it will be a strongly two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this respect, it also praised the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in the promotion of the principle that all the topics that have an impact on the whole of the Union are to be discussed between all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Brand story:
The innovationator of IBM begins the second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that expresses IBM's strategy in the most accurately, the closest thing would be "long-term."
To the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, and yet a century has passed since its founding.
The basis for this long-term nature was laid by the company's first chief executive, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became an imprint, around which the future giant's life will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson's carefully constructed corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a century because it remained loyal to its core values while not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to be able to achieve even more in the second hundred," said the company's current director, Samuel J. Palmisano, on the anniversary.
Reworked system
Watson approached the care of his employees in the 1930s in the same way as entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - people from IBM were one of the first U.S. employees with paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform, and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and traders.
The same elaborate long-term IBM has a relationship with the customer.
Society was brilliant at talent extraction from the start - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is to be replaced by a woman - Virginia Rometty - at the forefront of IBM next year.
It has been at IBM for 30 years, still holding the position of Chief Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called jams in recent years, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations arose.
No wonder there are enough ideas - there are nearly half a million people working at the company.
Institutions with a good name
A firm position in the business is provided by its strong inner and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," Harvard Business School professor and author of the book's book, told the Economist, by IBM, by Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony of the consultancy firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, it is the difference between entering the market and thus creating the market outright.
IBM - or "The Big Blue," as it is familiarly dubbed because of its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a century.
It is perhaps the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infra-sturustructure, hosting and consulting services in the range of products from post-technology servers.
It holds the most patents of any American technology company, and five of its employees won the Nobel Prize.
Among her inventions are an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy disk.
IBM, with some $220 billion, became the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (the first is Apple) when it overtaken Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
View forwards
Not all products and innovations hit the taste of customers and times - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own OS/2, Prodiga's online services or the IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built on the forward movement, you cannot be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, leave them.
Unlike, say, a rival Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
Services accounted for the largest share of IBM's revenues, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth.
As recently as 1990, he was the most powerful representative of the hardware with a share of more than half.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-waste assets, investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technology over the same time.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time.
IBM is acting on the link of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who has also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis untouched.
IBM's share price has risen by a rocket 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, while the company's net profit is steadily rising.
IBM's company password is to change everything, just its values.
It can therefore be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant can handle it.
History IBM: From cheese slices to space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally called Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It did not take the name IBM until 1924 - originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was given by the merger of four firms, whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
It was owned by technology such as the famous "stings," an hour recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new firm was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired the head of rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on Watson's unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all sorts of machines for business - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years that Watson had headed the company, turnover had doubled to $9 million and the company's widespread expansion into all continents began.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that, after nearly forty years in the chief's chair, he was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly space to fly to space - to Mercury, Saturn, and, in 1969, the famous human flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System/360.
The classic "Pécé," which established the computer standard of the time, called IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, it bought the consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote itself full of high added value consultancy and services.
The strategy that has paid off for the past three years by IBM is the Smarter Planet concept, the "smarter planets."
It aims to make smart use of technologies in hitherto, as yet or for unplanned areas, and to improve the situation in, for example, transport or urban management.
For the trade sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps merchants manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
She founded her branch in what was then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Centre is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dedicated to voice recognition.
Rychtářová on the unfaithful husband:
Iveta, you don't want to do that donkey!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also the lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and come home.
But now he was not going to wait, and she had set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rychtářová explained.
When Darina Rychtářová granted asylum to Bartošová in her home in the summer, she did not seem to dream how her marriage would end in the end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of Říčany at her urging after 30 days, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, had taken a while to accept her husband's relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
Quick-chář don't care who his wife sleeps with
If the speedster and Bartošová had broken up once, his wife's open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our shared house, no one will ban him."
"However, he will live through it not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rychtářová said, noting that she has already detroch herself of her husband and insists on mutual decency.
Joseph didn't bother him with Darina's back door for him.
"I respect the wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change that."
"My wife set up a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, the garden, the property, I buy."
'We're talking to Darina quite normally, only we don't share a bed,' said the speedster.
If the speedster also found a new love, she said she would not stop her.
"We don't, and I don't care where he's going, who he's going with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility," Josef concluded.
The worst female bad habits: Do they concern you?
If you ask the men if they could list any typical female bad habits, as a rule, they all in a very readily sprintick from their sleeve.
Dear women, will you know each other in the following lines, which are listed by several female bad habits that can perfectly pump up men's blood in their veins?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one cloth a week?
Do you like to shop and collectively at discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women are aware that they should restrain their buying passion at least a little.
But tell me, which would resist just being around to the clothing store, looking for well-fitting tops, and then try them all (ideally in different colours) in the stall?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell of a man.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you in front of the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these sentences remind you of anything?
Isn't it?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with the way they look.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are downright allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
Stronger sexes also agree that the more the frequency of this complaining increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an endless carousel.
Waving windows, vacuuming, mopping paving, dusting, scrubing the bath - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for putting his dirty foot on the clean paving, for the children's soiling of the scrubbed sink and curing the glass living room, with the polishing of which you took so much trouble?
In case you suffer from this "dango," try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not become the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for purity can jeopardise your interrelationship of your relationship and family well-being.
Rake
"Gl, throw the shorts you used in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"I mean, wet the tore doesn't belong on the ground."
If you dig into your partner like this several times a day, know that you can so reliably piss him off.
Of course you don't mean any harm, you want to make sure everything is in order.
Perhaps if men had known, the women wouldn't have to dig that much...
The slandering, the gossiping
For some women, gossip, gossip, but also are insulted and co-in-arrageed against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Perhaps each of us will release a little harmless gossip or a gossip from time to time.
Hand on heart, it's inherent in almost all women.
But the opposite is the gossip of the grossest grain, which they like and often gossip, perhaps despis each, and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially within the female working group.
Jagr and Voracek helped with assists in Philadelphia win
Hockey forward Jaromir Jagr has had two assists in Philadelphia's 5-3 win at Carolina in Monday's NHL game and is back at the forefront of the Czech players' productivity in the competition.
The 39-year-old star's review was mined in both cases by Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the game's best player.
Two assists in the match were also scored by Jágrů's teammate Jakub Voracek.
After the match, Jagr claimed to overseas journalists that he had predicted Giroux a big night.
"I told him before the game he'd score a hat trick."
"I felt it."
'Sometimes that feeling comes over,' said Jagr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal from the Flyers' first shot.
Moments later, the team's second strike also had a Czech footprint.
Voracek won the rebound behind the goal and presented it between the rings to the scoring Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer was reduced in a weakened position, but the start of the second leg was again the Flyers.
Specifically to the Giroux.
After working with Jagr, he scored his third goal, then his shot was tipped by Wayne Simmonds in the fourth goal.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," said Jagr of his centre.
"I never thought I'd play with a hockey player like him at the end of my career."
"That's what I'm happy about."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates were trying to play me, now it's turning to it," added Jagr.
Carolina made the game a drama, with a goal from Tuom Ruutu, and again Dwyer, who made it through the penalty, to the one-goal goal.
But another complication was not made by Matt Read, who finished the two-on-one.
"He's done well in our Pronger band."
"He punched out the puck, and I picked up speed and (Read) drove to the far post."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voracek said, describing the last goal of the game from his point of view.
Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference with a victory.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek failed to finish the game against Buffalo, who retired in the second period due to an upper-body injury.
Candiens lost a two-goal lead alongside the experienced back and lost after a penalty shootout 2-3.
One of their raids was not converted by Tomas Plekanec.
The home coach was annoyed by the extensive infirmary of the back-rothe ranks, with only five defenders finishing the game.
"It's wrong."
"We only finished the game with one experienced player, the rest were youngsters."
"But there's just nothing you can do about it, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"The rotation alternation was coming at us and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, moving the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," added one of the defensemen P. K. Subban.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 saves for Winnipeg in a 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, which broke a five-game losing streak, were shared by five different scorers.
How tour prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia at the time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time were overwhelmingly selling only trips to the socialist bloc countries, as travel to the west was very restricted.
Czech tourists thus travelled on holiday to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in Crimea by the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (bels in the Black Sea) and Hungary (the Balathon).
The bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when there was also the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually even within socialist countries.
In case a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to individually travel to, for example, Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise the individual way was not possible.
Travel agents were also offering tours to the West at the time, but it was necessary to queue overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, it was not won.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who were thus unable to travel at all.
Czechoslovakia's currency was not a freely convercible currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to raise funds (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
By far the most common time, however, Czechs vacationed in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs acquired and this custom still survives today.
Travel by the Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in the countries around the world.
The huge paradox, which we are no longer aware of today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to us for the most popular Croatia at the moment, as it was part of what was then Yugoslavia.
Early in the 1990s, the visa requirement was lifted to neighbouring Western European countries, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits to Vienna or Germany in Austria in particular.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there at least for a while.
In Paris, for example, the tours of Czechs in parks in tents were sleeping, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guesthouse.
A typical feature of Czechs' travel at this time was to carver, canned goods, salamis, etc. to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of a freely convergeable Czech crown, which our tourists were able to buy the Western currency freely after many of the years.
But our standard of living, and with it, average salaries rose, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agents have started to regularly prepare tours with charter air links since 1997, making air tours incredibly cheaper thanks to the possibility of contracting quantity discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs already had visa-free travel to virtually every developed country in the world, except the US, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came as early as 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first direct charter flight to exotica was dispatched from the Czech Republic, it was to Thailand.
From this year, direct charters fly with Czech tourists to warm far-dry countries, this winter will be flown directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US revoked visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in their history, Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and spent more than CZK 15,000 per person on one foreign holiday, including the cost of the whereabouts, for the first time in their history.
The general meeting is to find the chairman, but again the stalemate is imminent
For almost five months, Czech football is without a chairman and there is a risk that the successor to Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR) will not be known after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
There is still no agreement on which electoral code to proceed.
Without it, the vote will not even begin to be voted on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interest in leading Czech football is to Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hasek resigned his post in June and, as he left, called on colleagues to unite and find a strong figure to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hasek era, football slipped back to the fight between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the general meeting came to the National House in Prague in Smíchov unnecessarily, as the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a choice.
Nor was there to agree on who had the right to actually vote on the pile - whether only the statutory representatives or even the functionaries credentials of the power of attorney.
There has been a partial consensus on this one point since, helped by a recommendation from the Constitution for the State and the right under which representation on the basis of a power of attorney is not possible.
But there are still controversy over the electoral code.
Not even the executive committee has brought too much clarity to the situation, which is already dealing with basically nothing else at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," stated one of the three vice-presidents of the FACR, Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's management.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is reportedly willing to take a concession to win a candidate who receives a higher sum of the votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side advocates the condition that the winner must obtain at least a two-thirds advantage at this percentage count.
"But then it would make sense of the two previous rounds, that would completely deny the bicameral concept," the Freedom Party of Moravian understands, according to which it would be best to not bend the order and to vote according to the existing statutes.
Tomáš Paclík is somewhat surprisingly agreeing with this, although it is estimated that the statutes set by the electoral code suit Pelt the most of all the candidates.
"I wish you to vote as far as the statutes were elected at the most."
"So that some surrogate nonsense is not invented as at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktorie Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his comments defined himself primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he says, the new chairman will be known and believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All passions will be reassured by the national team's eventual European Championship run today."
"Fotbal will be on a happy wave again, it will be more willing to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who has the most experience in running football at both professional and regional level in the trio.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope to make a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"This is not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to purposefully adapt the regulations."
"This may cause the blocking of the general meeting to happen again."
"But I hope that common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There is little time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some of the negotiations were supposedly due to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football general will be complete by the match.
The aerial special, in which the vice-presidents Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were to travel to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and was looking for a replacement option to transport part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage retaliation.
In the end, a ministerial-level meeting that may be reportedly on Wednesdays may be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobeš, would like to induce the ambivalent parties within the country's strongest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football, as well as the forthcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík goes to battle for the chairman because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
Had the head of Pilsen, Tomáš Paclík, the head of the football team, seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FACR), he would not have entered into the battle for the top job.
"If there is a good recruit, I fight for him and I'm not going to the poll."
"But in the current situation, no one like this has been found," Paclík told the Czech Press Agency.
Going into the fight with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, he is chastitating Paclík's motivation for him to try to stop Pelt, the alleged favourite of the election, from getting in the way of the FACR.
Paclík also stresses that, if he won, he would only last until 2013, when a full general meeting is on the agenda.
In the job, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not very connected to football events.
"I have spoken to some people who might be considered."
"It was crazy for me when some said that at the moment they didn't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
Paclík is said to be most bothered by Pelt's association with the president of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation backstage who is known at the back of the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the delegate's vote at the general meeting.
It is so unacceptable for Paclík to stand in the Presidency position.
"If he'd won, the status quo would be mothball, and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"Combined with the support of Berbro, who is a skisk businessman, it would not benefit football even more," Paclík said.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelt's name was mentioned years ago in the wiretaps in the investigation of the corruption affair, but from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know the prestige of football Pelt's victory would bring."
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is also taking in his former statement with insight that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became the chairman's chairman."
But if Paclík triumphed in Thursday's election, he could have imagined future cooperation with Pelta.
So is another candidate, Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd go to."
"He's very able."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But he couldn't manage the association managerially."
"I also don't poke my nose where I can't do it," said Paclík, who drew great attention in September by the fact that he was behind the dismissal of the referees' committee headed by Luďk Macel, who was replaced by Dagmar Damk.
Paclík says he would dare to lead the association.
He refers to his ability to manage private companies, and since last summer he has also headed Pilsen, which celebrated its premier league triumph with its support in May.
"I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment, to contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"To limit the influences of some interest groups, which need to be influenced by the Disciplinary and Appeal Committee, which goes all the way to disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy to, for example, Spartan boss Daniel Křetínský.
He would also consider one of the priorities to be the strengthening of the FACR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby for political leaders to receive more lottery tax money in the sport.
"It's one of the key things the new chairman should be involved with."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, I understand their reasoning, but they must be clear where the money will go," he noted.
As a liability, Paclík now does not even take his connection to the Pilsen club, although he claims that the president of the FACR should be "supraine."
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see the point of transferring my shares in the Pilsen club hypocritically to someone and go back there in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FACR statutes to rule out electoral stalemate
Two days before the Football Association's general meeting, one of the candidates for president, Miroslav Pelta, promised to make the case of election so that the FACC would have new statutes that would ultimately rule out disputes over the electoral code in the future.
The Jablonec official is an optimist before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the election fight will be significantly dampened by the eventual success of the football team today.
Pelta had already promised before the unfinished election in September that he intended to concentrate on the representation and fundraising if elected.
He decided to go to the last-minute election before the previous general meeting, so a two-month delay could be useful to defend his ideas about the football management and introduce him in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect to be known by the chairman on Thursday."
"It is high time that it is time for the association to be led by someone," says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who has served for many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the union.
He therefore believes that he has the experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election are the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, at the General Meeting in June, the statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they didn't allow for different interpretations, we've had the chairman since September," Pelta pointed out.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he conceived as a bind to the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I'll take it as a personal task, and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if I fail."
"It's a matter of principle that we can't be without," Pelta says.
He says he's no longer trying to define himself against his rivals.
He had previously announced that he could envisage working with Henry Rajch, whom he recognizes because of his legal training, and he knew well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He did not attack for a long time for Tomas Paclík, who, on the other hand, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's had some successes."
"But his attacks were undignified, and he caught a lot of people off guard by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them now doubt his true character," he said of the opponent's address to Pelt, who is said to remain loyal to the proclamations he announced in September.
His strongest weapon, he says, is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
This should be a showcase for football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs starting with the Bohemians case or the repercussions of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would rush to the meeting with the private and state sectors right away to secure enough money for the whole of football," the 46-year-old candidate told the Czech Press Agency two months ago.
He also promised at the time that his arrival at the top of football would not mean any staff purges.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the content of individual employees," he said to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from the long limp.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios surrounding the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that on Thursday the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If the only point of contention is how you vote in the third round, we can get over it."
"Froccball needs credibility, and he will gain that only by finally having his leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the crucial date of his official career.
Rajchl promises that FACR would start working hard under him
If the current vice-chairman, Jindřich Rajchl, had been elected the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday's general meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased.
For Rajchl promises that if he is elected, work will start to work hard.
It wants to push for systemic changes and make the executive committee members responsible for the various football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money to football and continue the work started by the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I would like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national team, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I am not saying that I did everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with the Czech News Agency.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the competencies on the executive committee so that each member is devoted to a certain area."
"And I'll be handing out hardwork to make football a mile ahead in each segment."
"I don't think it would make many people happy because it would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he had considered not running again.
"I'm known to do 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have the people behind me who will constantly throw sticks at my feet and question my every move," he said, explaining why he hesitated.
"But a lot of people told me I couldn't give up, because then others would give up."
"This is a trust that I cannot just throw away," he said.
He is also motivating him to continue the work he began with Hasek.
"There's been a lot of work in those two years, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are trials that will have a reverberation of a few years from now, and I would not like to be stopped by someone," he said with fears that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation on the union could return to the time before Hashk.
"I believe in systematically, and that's the thing I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"Behind him, above all, there are people who would do football in such a way that it would only be for the elect."
"A lot of things can be blamed for me, but certainly not that I'm siding with someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone because then everyone will be well and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl observed.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech chairman.
"Although some people are trying to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would go to the first league."
"It would not be such a current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem towards the young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
As the head of the Pilsen club, Tomáš Paclík, joined the fight for the chairman, he does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-chairman and sees that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who sees saving tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, negotiating televisions and negotiating the lottery law as his achievements.
On the contrary, he makes a fellows in the fact that the union does not pull together.
While he claims to be "discredited by returning the trust to Czech football," the second of his rivals Paclík considers a strong candidate to offer football.
"No one can dispute that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he was elected, he would perhaps continue the things that Ivan Hasek started here and he wouldn't have changed the staffing of the commisses."
"He wouldn't want to twirle it to his advantage," Rajchl says.
Europe's most beautiful swimming pools
Jump to the blue
Julia Stanek
The paddling pool from the point of view of Ufono, a sumptuous swimming pool in Budapest: Those travelling in Europe can experience their blue miracle - and, after exploring cities or travelling, let your tired legs rest in thermal baths.
The book will show where the wellness is the most beautiful by the water.
As Iris Meder made her making her in the past one-and-a-half year of the voyelt, her luggage was not to be missed: her swimsuit.
Lying on the water, she looked up at the top of the artistically shaped dcuds, swam across from the marble putti (I'm building a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) who were waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked the swimming pool, she took it into her notebook in an instant - even with the remarkable details of the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored in this way by the architect's Meder architecture historian and now presents them in her just-released book "Badefreuden (Junkiness) ": the People's Swimming Swimming Poopla swimming pools, the historic swimming pool halls in Schwarzwald,"Thevrd Corest Core of the Concrete Construction" in Taunus.
13 countries ran it with her "Tour for the most extraordinary spa in Central Europe": Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia at a time.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
It's not overdoing the sport, says Meder - it's just different in the water.
The only thing to say about anger is that swimming fans have to settle for themselves with the blue tiles and the smell of the chlorine, while runners for health can inhale the intoxicating scent of spruce forests or listen to the hilarious chatting of the birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so hideous," says the living Mrs. Meder in Vienna.
"So I started to gather nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Splashing in the ski jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the comfort factor is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much to the Meder.
And when the founders tried, the swimming pools can be a real eye-curve: "The floor is water-fat in the spa."
"It's both transparent, but on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visually doubled: a tall vault, a varied tachle, a diving board.
The form-format picture volume "Badefreuden (Jourges from Bathing)" provides in 190 pages everything to be known about the architectural and cultural history of historical well-eases - but it mainly inspires the desire to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens was discovered by the collector of the swimming pool, Ms. Meder, in her search in Hungary.
In addition to the beautiful healing spa, like the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (the Hessy Spa in Miskolc-Tapolca) and the thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are placed in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
A beautiful spectacle, on the other hand, is offered by many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria. While a man has from the Zurich's roof-haired swimming pool to the whole city, the outdoor swimming pool of the spa in St. Anton can look at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam baths there is a window from which to watch the road on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most remarkable swimming pool design awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like ufo, which has just landed in the Alps.
From the three uped open pans in winter, the steam rises while it rises to the sky in the background of Mount Ötztal.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector, Mrs. Meder, climbed into the nurse of chlorine.
Many of the thermal baths are felt after the sulphur, in the spa Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells of fuel oil to the point where one hardly believes that you have made it to the therapeutic spa.
The smell comes from healing water containing alkaline hydrodenililic, which is almost black and whose sediment is clinging to the skin as soon as one slips into the pool - a rather odd wellness experience.
However, one place was also disappointed by Iris Meder in her search for a nice spa: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate baths Luhačovice, she came across the enclosed terrain.
In 1902, the architect Dušan Jurkovič's proposed spa was closed in the meantime.
When Lady Meder looked at the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds grow massively among the tiles.
The demo was built, on the other hand, in the Magic Floor at the Schwarzwald: Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already had three phases of construction; one can discover not only the New-Romani elements that date from their creation in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra-style hall, which was connected around 1900.
Since the meticulous modernisation of 1995, Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place for the swimming pool connoisseur Ms. Iris Meder, not least because she comes from the Schwarzwald.
"It's already a feat, combining such a variety of building styles in such a beautiful complex," says Ms Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is apparently a marginal issue.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank to be vetted by commodity deal
Christian Teevs
is Deutsche Bank leaving its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
Then, in January, the chief executive of the concern wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Indeed, two-thirds of those surveyed demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of the deal because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of a Forsa poll commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study relies on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author, Harald Schumann, shows that betting on global commodity exchanges is driving prices to the height and banks are therefore complicit in the world's problem of hunger.
The Consumer Protector's campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, although big-bankers like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are also acting similarly.
Initially, commodity betting was intended to make sure traders insured against price fluctuates.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk trades have detroch themselves from supply and demand - making gains in the poorest's expense.
Other than competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann's criticism: He promised to test the reprimands and said that no deal was "worse to put Deutsche Bank's reputation at stake."
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is reviewing the complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The check is due to be closed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's board of directors - along with a recommendation on how to handle it.
Then, at the end of January, bank officials want to say what consequences they will draw.
At the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but he also intensified his criticism of the financial sector: "Lowing on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how, ruthlessly, banks are now harming the general well-being."
Let Ackermann, as the top banking lobbyist, live up to the obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must cut all items from its portfolio that is used for food price betting," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with starving people suffering or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Concern chief would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he left office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chief executive officer of the board of directors would not go to the supervisory board.
By turning away from disputed agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about the potential losses - his successor should be able to cope with that in the end.
One in two would terminat the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain a high push on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode released a poll in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is eleven per cent who consider it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments with bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such deals: Every other one would testify, as a result of the poll, any investments in which the money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43 per cent would have warned acquaintances about such a bank, 49 per cent said they would think about the expat from their account and move on to another institution.
21st Century House in Vienna
Moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with the highlights, falls and a happy ending: The Austrian Pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won awards, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
It is now being reopened as a showroom.
When it boils for modern post-war architecture, for bright forms, glass halls, bold boomes and new building materials that are typical of faith in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karel Schwanzer is an apt and famous example for the World's Fair 1958.
The Schwanzer Pavilion received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and lofty steel and glass structure.
The building is still seen as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He became famous for the architect to build the Austrian pavilion for the next World Exposition.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palác plus as a key performed by a secondary building in Munich, he was finally famous for himself in 1973.
His as a temporary exhibition building, the projected pavilion was placed in the Schweizer Garten at the Südbahnhof (Sithogenic Railway Station) in Vienna, and in it they opened the Museum of the 20th Century in 1962 - it was named as "Denchs of the 20th Century."
But it was not suitable for the museum building, neither in spatially nor technically - the walls for hanging the art exhibits were missing, no suitable climate.
Yet it was used until contemporary art received a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and dátre more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has renovated the pavilion, now called the "Dench of the 21st Century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
A new start for Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere, came through.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a distinguished career, a figure skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and, as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, pushed for a major renovation by politicians and preservationists, procured public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba's foundations should be exhibited, a café and a bookshop should be created, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Strict surveillance, low budget.
To perform, Krischanitz was then the ideal cast.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich's Art Nouveau buildings in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer, and the pavilion was an "eagerly important place" for him, at which he inspected exhibitions "albeat for a weekend.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness in its relocation to Vienna and the change of use.
The current reconstruction was much more of a problem: the building was a "cat-to-energy cicapult," says Krischanitz.
The glass facade window profiles were replaced, with glass fibers reinforced with insulating glass and a glass roof replaced with a special safety glass.
The cold bridges-clad girders were reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled ceilings were sanitized.
The two underground floors provided a place for new use, the embedded lighting channel between the building and the street provided lighting, with a bridge leading to the entrance - a near-new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown colour tone.
And the cinema hall is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Heritage Office and the low budget.
"Often material had to be found that is good and inexpensive and also liked the monument office," says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
Difficult, he said, was with the pavilion "who came here from Brussels," Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history" recently.
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "get proper self-confidence."
In this case, however, the 21st-century House is not in a place to be in an improper place, as an urban happy coincidence has come to: A completely projected "Curban Quarter at the Central Station" is being created in the ring road around the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps there will be another happy coincidence: the 21st-century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already in talks with the city of the neighbourhood at the post at the Schweizer Garten site.
The track is planning a package for the winter crisis of millions
The runway has pipped a contingency plan to prevent train outage in the winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported tentatively, citing an internal group plan, that it said to be projected to include a total of around 300 million euros of investments by 2015.
It is said to help improve the use of trains and the rail network also under extreme weather conditions.
It is said to be planned to double the number of internal and external staff to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms, among other things.
The aim is to get rid of the platform until the start of service and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary switches during the four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the rail chief, Rüdiger Grube, warned after a top-level meeting with government and industry leaders against train outages and delays during this winter.
Last winter, the passenger car has had considerable problems with passenger traffic, as it had, among other things, a shortage of reserves under difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Federal Railways Authority.
This is also the approach of delays in the transport of ICE trains
The runway has also failed for years that it must probably be more likely to be inspected by the design of the ICE trains when it was destructed by the destruct of the axle at one of the ICE train at Köln Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays $1 million fine in US
After the uproar over Chief Josef Ackermann, there are new trampings in the US: Deutsche Bank must pay millions in damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank's problems were not enough at home, the industry giant was caught up by its past in the US: The Frankfurt institution pays $145 million (EUR) in a single equation process to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage lists.
The financial market regulator NCUA reproaches a number of major banks for bringing together cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost considerable value in the course of the crisis and brought the banks with them into the abyss.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the need to drag the parties to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank does not plead guilty by the settlement.
This is also true for Citigroup, which is committed to paying 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the friendliness of the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is competent for cooperative banks in the US and helps with bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for the billion-dollar damages incurred.
The settlement terminated now is the first of its kind.
The regulator also became fixated on other Grand Bobanes and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
For dubious mortgage lists, this is the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the US real estate bubble burst in 2007, it became fatal to a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events took place a few years ago, a sharp wind is now blowing in the banks' mouths.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to reach a remedy or befallen misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
He accuses 18 international grandbanks of having disadvantaged two US real estate finance fans, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in mortgage deals of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit against FHFA, here it is more business worth a total of about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Office of Doha is called for the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without, however, giving any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IBM IT-undercark.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of stock.
The hitherto major US investor, Warren Buffett, has always claimed not to invest in IT and computers because he will be allowed to anticipate the long-term development of companies with difficulty.
But now he read the IBM business reports and changed his opinion of investment in the industry.
He has had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services in particular and acquits computer systems for the IT-departing of other businesses.
Warren Buffett's investment is viewed as knighthoods in the financial world.
As a result, it is allowed to call the mother's IT rock IBM now "Sir IBM."
For Buffett revealed on the US economic radio station CNBC that he had purchased $10.7 billion worth of IBM shares since March.
His Investmentholding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett sagte, even IBM didn't know anything about his engagement yet.
He praised management, which tried even for proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT-services such as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for companies.
Buffett has rather avoided technology firms to date.
It claims to invest only in undertakings whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight rail, for the lubricant manufacturer, or the machinery manufacturers.
In addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, his Holding Berkshire Hathaway also owns stakes in a wide range of Grand Duchners such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old gentleman took over a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s and built it into one of the most valuable businesses in the world through wisely investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money making brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha (Miracle of Omaha."
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's shares rose by one percent before the stock market began.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, has a total stock market price of more than $220 billion and is considered to be the world's most valuable technology companies, along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to start.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be his intimate friend.
Threats are palpable
After the discovery of the "Buňkau Buňkau" the Turkish media have doubted the rule of law.
The newspaper even talks about the "blooding ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small-scale businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek one between 2000 and 2006 had a right-leaning extremist background.
This report was responded to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
For many German Turks, this brings back the spectre that has long been considered dead: There has been no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background since the Mölln arson attacks in Mölln in May 1993, and in Solingen in May 1993.
That there is a xenophobia in Germany, yet, was never in doubt.
But the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals a scale whose dimensions can no longer be seen.
"Does he revive the bloody ideology again?" were the headlines in the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The "Sabah" newspaper, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was to be a secret police officer in the Department for the Protection of the Constitution and fear that the German authorities could also be implicated in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded widescatingly: It recalled the weekend of the demonstrations in silence in front of the Brandeburg gates of the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish Municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, recalled the ceremonial act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colours, a life together was staged - as a history of success.
As a slap, the coverage of several Turkish media: "German's Fiftien gift" features the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X" that reports on the backdrop of the murder series.
Also, the publication of the "Hürriyet" for Germany is not to be taken away from making this intellectual connection.
"It's starting to ben up," is the headline of a post by Ahmet Külahci.
It underlines that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to Germany's reconstruction were murdered.
Most criticically, the actions of the police and their late success in the search are discussed in the German-Turkish online forums.
Why it had not occurred to the German authorities much earlier to search for the suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are at least rhetorically prompted to use drastic means: "If the activity is carried out so superficially, immigrants will have no choice but their own defenses and armed."
"That's perhaps the best self-defense."
"The quality of the clarification and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network is very strongly dependent on internal peace in Germany ", writes "Selen."
What does it mean if internal peace in Germany is threatened is being explained by the assassinations in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the burnt-out in Solingen is deeply etched in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
For no other event has shown the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can result in right-wing violence
But the assassinations made the Turk's side a more noticeable sense of reciprocity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, it was primarily criticised by the failure of German policy after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in the Mölln survivors.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish state president, but was appointed to his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, at the Köln mourning ceremony - Kinkel at the time, calculated in his speech what fees the Turks here were handing over.
Quite as if a person's value is measured by the height of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how profound the mistrust of many German Turks in the local state-lawed arrangement.
In addition to efforts to make extensive clarification and a new evaluation of right-right-leaning of terrorist terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandalous bank at Lake Zurich
Europe's most adventurous bank is not established in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to another.
Now a German is to straighten it out.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think that.
After his noisy departure from the head of the leadership of the Federal Bank, he became known in July for a fresh new job to start in 2013: the president of the board of the Swiss Grand BPM UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber was looking forward to it publicly, praising Switzerland, whether for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and called friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has achieved a turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it was clear in September that things would turn out very differently.
A dealer from UBS in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and wasted around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, not only a respected banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
The president of the board of directors of UBS has since been a messed up, and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank said on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather a professor of economics and an issuance banker, and he would certainly need a time to work.
He will then take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once again proved that he deserves the title of "Banka of the Greatest Scandals in Europe"
For UBS is both huge - until recently, it was the world's largest property manager - and has been gleaning for years from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, so it seems, will not be spared the proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid but also shrewd asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So it managed UBS 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 trillion in more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she advanced as an investment bank to the league of the world's biggest banks
That impressed.
The former banker and later longtime banking professor at Zurich, Hans Geiger, tells the story: "I always cited UBS as a model for my students at the time."
"From today's perspective, one asks: How could I be so wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was first apparent that something had wronged at UBS.
In the middle of the year, surprisingly, Peter Wuffli, the board's chief executive, resigned, as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later, he suspected why he had left.
The bank's investment division wasted the Subprime-papinate and had to write off billions.
To stand it, UBS announced a capital increase of indeed 13 billion francs.
But she did find investors, but one that would have been the nose that had recently been turned up: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one did not even learn its name.
But that was just the first bump.
In April 2008, it was harder to develop.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of the board of directors, Marcel Ospel, the second highest-paid board of directors of Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
A disaster ensued in October 2008: UBS, given its flawed investment in the financial crisis, faced a breakdown and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank bought up problematic securities from UBS for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on mandatory convertible bonds for which it could become the co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - for it has noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the UBS 2007 balance sheet total was more than five times greater than that of Switzerland's economy (see picture).
"We could not save UBS one day," says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For months, UBS had capitulated to this in a tax dispute with America and showed a willingness to release data from wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, had been cutting taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay out $780 million - as a return of unauthorized profits from those deals, including a penalty surper.
This underpended UBS, more or less openly, by aiding tax cuts.
At the same time, she had lost something that had always been her capital in a competition for wealthy clients: a halo of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it was before.
This was followed by the resignation of the chief executive board of directors and the president of the board.
And an exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central commercial areas over the course of several months: In investment banking, due to poor speculation and asset management to aiding and abetting tax cuts.
And just when it calmed down a bit again, just as it was thought that UBS had recovered again, this unfortunate trade anabase is coming up: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it's clear: with risk management in investment banking, it doesn't seem to be going right yet.
"The Adoboli case has probably found that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and Finance professor at the Zürich University's Banking Institute.
The finance director of the big German bank is also sure: "The problem for UBS is that it is not managing risk control."
Yet it was exactly the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had set out with a long time ago to become watchdogs of the world's great fortunes: no too much risk, but security for money - the Alpine Republic's world had collapsed again on this side.
The vaults of Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich are still suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The position is already classic.
The bank has its main headquarters in Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, with store rentals among the highest in Europe.
The jewelry store as Tiffany's is among the Swiss traditional shops like the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries, it has housed Swiss banks: from Nationalbank to Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The receptionist hall of UBS is entered through heavy revolving doors.
Inside are marble-lined walls, with massive leather chairs in front of them, a large rudder to "sejf" alongside the bank's logo.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea of the Swiss Bank by the two Swiss Grand Bankans, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes - was suppressed or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not want to read his name in the newspapers, he concludes, like all Swiss bankers, with the two grandbanks of business.
UBS has probably grown too much, it is surveys - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss probably have nothing more to say about it.
"And if they had, they had adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought about at first high profits, and then a disaster: No European financial institute lost as much money in the jungle around the Subprime as the Schweizer Großbank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"At that center, the ruling coalition of a small seven million country decided to take place at the largest rescue effort in the history of its nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash."
Up to 68 billion francs or some 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to bail out of bankruptcy of a grand BBank.
How could this have happened?
If they talk to Swiss bankers, they see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Grand Banks were merged into a massive concern.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
In doing so, it helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS were complemented: One Rich but sleepy bank in Zurich, with its focus in wealth management and poorer but more internationally more heavily involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came in advantage of a lot of money with which they could spin a large roulette wheel.
Two names are associated with this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, UBS chief executive and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors from 2001 to 2007.
"I have always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest one who knows much about the models and the statistics, and Ospel, the man guided by the feelings around his stomach that has developed completely up from the banking science."
But Ospel was said to be relying on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli was probably making a decisive mistake at the end: "I guess he thought his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
What is clear is: Prisy preceded the fall.
UBS staff clearly remembers the senior meetings at Wuffli's senior staffers on which Wuffli's chief executive repeated the same slogan again: to cut Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The U.S. Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She said "League Tables," a waiting list that documents the success of the banks of that time.
In it, UBS was trying to get the placement at the top.
A few steps had already been successful.
In the foreign exchange and equity trade, she participated in the game at the very top.
But the business advisers in charge of stress one weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the language of the "Fixed Income" bankers, there is probably a big distance behind the biggest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close the gap, UBS committed to an adventure that had almost cost it its existence.
The starve to growth, the bank itself and its own fund to hedge risks in the US investment of Subprime's investments, have invested.
It developed into a massive machine that was changing the securities to US mortgage loans and forwarding it - but also retaining the risks.
Also, when the other banks were long looking for a way out.
"As early as the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there," says banking expert Geiger.
How big is the euphemo, the deep fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
The UBS position has become a catapult seat and swing until today.
Whoever runs the Grand Duch for now has an almost unmanaged job.
They must find a strategy for the bank that all the nearby business models have disappeared.
Bank expert Geiger already has an idea: an end to investment banking, a concentration on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (stre).
But investment banking is to be severely d withle-stated, so much is clear now.
Next Thursday, the bank's new chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss Italian was seen as a transitional solution when, surprisingly, the bank broke up with its predecessor, Grübel.
In the meantime, he has asserted himself: He is to run UBS's business for a long time, the Zurich Bank told the Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on the situation in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats will be cut.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But he is only publicly saying that he will find an apartment in Zurich first.
Next year.

This has skeptical of investors in the US. "We are not an island, but addicts," said Goldman, a royalte's Steve Goldman.
Europe will not recover from the recession as quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: He told a CNBC-Inview that it would probably not yet be clear whether Europe was strong enough to do its best to end the crisis.
That is why, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the decades-old principle and entered the American tech industry.

Intelligent crows expand in cities
In many places, field ravens are seen as "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals cannot be expred from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The crows have been in the city's image for centuries, yet in some municipalities the complaints of the inhabitants are accumulating to the impurity and noise caused by the animals.
At the same time, there is no means of sight against the "temwitch of the "problem."
The ogre's field altitus is probably no longer to be expel from the cities, experts at the first sympome said of the churges in East-frue Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Meanwhile, conservationists derived the problems of the cities from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
The persecution, the growing development and the felling of typical trees to nest for the birds make life difficult.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are in the Westphalian Soest, northwest, among others, in the Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, the 2005 disputed project of mass killing of pranes in the country district triggered negative headlines.
Critics called the capture of animals in bird traps and the killing of the sticks to be particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, of the ape-watter, it brings nothing," the urban planner and landscape designer Werner Klöver of Leer found so much.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg, also said.
"The animals retreat, the large colonies are split and divided into different places."
The outwire is conceivable only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the view of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Thinking is a combination of expleting animals from sensitive residential areas and germination to settle in other places.
"Information board instead of chain saw saws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different treatment of animals: "One perva in the face can be best at all with confidence after all."
Ms Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg educational trail in Schleswig-Holstein, on which the information boards provide lessons about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have been accepted by tourists in the meantime.
Also, on the criticism of the dummies caused by the birds, Ms Jürgens had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have much to say."
Animal intelligence and skill are legendary: Field Ravens not only use the aids to reach the treat, but even make their instrument as an aid.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the behaviour of four field ravens as far as the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring the stones to collapse the structure to reach the dosser of the pier.
Without much training, they knew the size and shape of the stone had to be to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more precarious problem.
In a vertically built cylinder, the researchers placed a tiny container of a larvae of the pier.
The beak could not be reached by the birds on their prey.
But the researchers put bits of wire for them.
From these, she made all four animals a hook, using as a forge to hunt the jar from the pipe behind the handle.
Three of the four field ravens managed to do so even with a cut.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks did not work for the Cup.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland received the last tickets for the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Led by the two-time-hit superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53.), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) to make a perfect appearance after a 0-0 first match of the fifth consecutive appearance at the European Championships.
The Czechs were able to make it 1-0 (0-0) in the Play-off with outsider Montenegro, when the first match was a clear thing.
The goal was not scored by Croatia with 0-0, with Ireland scoring a one-for-alton win 4-1.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional of the Federal League Zvujezdan Misimovic converted with a penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice reduced for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia have already failed to play in the 2010 World Cup play-off matches with Portugal in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 yards into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani produced his long-distance shot and made the shot from 25 yards to make the 2-0 2-0 with a shot.
The Bosnians, who did not act in the first half hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
The former Wolfsburu player from the English side at the top of the table, standing at the top of the table, the ball sat on the bottom edge of the crossbar with a header, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the centre.
After a tackle against Helder Postig in Bosnian penalty, Stark decided on Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card.
On the opposing party, Stark made a disputed penalty kick after the action of Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic was certain to convert.
But after the break, the European vice-captain of 2004 cleared up with four shots.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended his last doubts in the 81st minute.
With this, the European Champion of 1976 leaves for the fifth time in a row at the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilko with the Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also fortunate and had to overcome a terrible second at the start of the early stages.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal from Tomáš Sivok (9th) in a reflex moment at the last moment.
Montenegro had its best options when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damyanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from a rev from the edge of the penalty area only just past Chekhov's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already hit-and-fragged goalkeeper of the Czechs of the world class, again being reduced by striker FC Soul (50).
The goal was finally cleared up shortly before the conclusion.
Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb at that moment.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not cross the 0-0 lead in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink must almost securely clear his seat on the bench of the third World Cup in the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians are allowed to rejoice in their fourth appearance in the final round of the European Championships.
In front of the 31,000 spectators at the Maksimire Stadium, the Turks should have a near-tytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post with a shot from distance in the seventh minute, the striker Kazim also could not have hung the bounced ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia took over but increasingly control.
Also after the interruption, the Croats did not get the goal.
Alongside Mario Mandzukice of VfL Wolfsburg, who released Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Federal League Legionnaire Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first appearance at the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team to coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took the lead with a 4-0 success in the first match, to the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57) equalised for the visitors.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian defence prevent a possible leading goal.
In the 32nd minute, however, it was quite a long way.
After a failed defence by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line at 1-0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, it said, around $2 billion (approximately €1.5 billion), Dax told the group on Tuesday.
"We will create more research and development facilities and employ the relevant staff," said acting chief executive Bill McDermott at the Beijing Customer's Trade Fair.
The staff is now set to rise from the current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world's number one software for businesses will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world's more than 176,000 SAP customers are booming in the country.
Growth Plans in China are also an important building block of Dax's strategy for 2015.
SAP wants to increase its turnover to €20 billion by 2015.
Last year, Walldorf grossed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the software manufacturer's stores, which employs 55,000 employees on a global scale, are as well as ever.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...) ", said McDermott.
"Our goal, supported by a large-scale survey, is to promote sustained growth in China."
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's empowering new new book, Beauty and Sorrow: The Beauty and the Sorrows: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of performant characters.
One piece of advice on how to act at that point: carefully rip this page out of it and make a bookmark of it.
For you will be very familiar with all persons in Mr. Englund's novel's narrative, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - at times when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author describes it himself, quite aptly, as an "anti-historical work."
It contains several very well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, while it is almost missing ambassadors, energetic journalists, and debates about tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as "the book about what it was like". It mainly discusses "feeling, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beast and grief" combines the wartime experiences of 20 more or less of thetenes of men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from female students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and clerks.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives are flickered up like the flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the wit of destinians while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
It adjusts the notion that the First World War was only about the horrific trench fighting on the Western Front.
"Beast and grief" deftly explores other places where war dramas were taking place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book solve the problems with the fall of bee nests, have to spend Christmas in the shade of the pyramids, or face the presence of the tse-tse.
Almost from the start, it has been a very moving read.
The war will engulf people's lives like some kind of natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of gunposm.
When gunfire starts to come out in the distance and you're the woman who's at home with her children, run away or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, or even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum arose from a lack of facts," Mr. Englund noted, "concerns, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors were filled with."
"Beast and grief" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly readmirceled from biographies, letters and other already published material.
Descriptions of their lives may sound both terrifying and engaging, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are completely lively and believable.
Many of them are about hardship and coping with it.
In the story of the German student, the author says: "Tracks, all substitutes everywhere."
"Coffee-mon, a copycat of aluminum, imitations of rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "aim of pressed rice made from cooped oil (and supplemented with a false wood bone), dried-cup pancake and dried potato skathers, wooden-soled shoes."
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes for the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds the inner impulses of fernity and brutality, then declares the war, "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whisky, evening paper or a good book, and to pretend that this mask of yours is a civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind the starchy me in the interior."
The British soldier, on the other hand, realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone mourning.
"When one finally accepts the sacrifice, one would at least expect to do so in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, however, he feels like a "touchant whom he secretly hangs."
Other remarks relate to the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"The conflict was becoming more and more economic competition and a competitive fight," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he calls "a species of beast of the coming century: an outrageal and ideologically sweltering serial killer in a tailor-made dress that makes his bloodshed without getting up from the table."
People behave completely unexpectedly, the understated alternating with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes the soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a venereal disease from the prostitutes to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trade in gonoko pus, which the soldiers bought and cooed with their genitals with it in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate one intricately intricately intricately intricately, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is brisk but not spectacular, which is well suited to his human subject.
In dozens of small outings, he captures the way the war has "thougled out of utterly unmanageable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books on World War I mostly, rather than a comprehensive narrative, worked with hints, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell, or novels such as "On the Western Front of Calm of Calm" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming ending unprecedented in popular educational literature.
But I will not reveal it to you.
But you will feel as if suddenly the author jumped out of the book, snatched the page from the heroes' list's hand and set it on fire.
After a previous mistake, this one-minutely planned raid
Hundreds of police officers participated in it, some in the helmets used in the street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the action except a few senior officers. The others were first told that it was an exercise.
The event was headed by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face in the operation.
There was no relic to the cases of recent weeks, for example, when pepper sprayers were used against protesters, breaking the rules of the department, and, moreover, a wave of public sympathy spilled over to the squatters.
That is why the police operation to clean Zuccotti Park from the demonstrators was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
Leaders were inspired by the operations conducted in other cities.
A massive exercise in case of crisis behaviour took place in a section of Randalls Island, which was a preparation for the event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have intensified the so-called riots-crendulent training - counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers - focusing on the Lower Manhattan Municipal District.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders for the move to the park came literally "at the last minute" was stated by someone to whom the action was originally explained only as "the exercise."
"I know a few police officers who were also called to this event, and they were certainly not told that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on the condition that he remain anonymous.
"The highest-ranking members of the department knew about going to the Zuccottti Park."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had already received once.
On October 14, city officials planned to clean the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they flocked to the park for hundreds of them before the operation began.
Tuesday's event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from all over the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to reinforce neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, a large number of people were coming and out of the park, so one o'clock at night was the perfect time to start the event.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there were as few people as possible in the park," he said.
By the time the units set out, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge Bridge, cargo vehicles of emergency units with arc lamps and amplifielons.
The lights and the recorded news roaring from the ampliones frightened many of the demonstrators.
When members of the riot squads entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say she didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., which wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were spotted gathering at the edge of the park to enter it if there were any possible arrests to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police Department chief spokesman Paul J. Brown claimed that this was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their troops in action, and in addition to some police officers were rude to them.
Mr Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street, along the western border of the park, could easily be filmed.
Police moved in a westerly direction and weave through the dense jumble of the protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothing. Behind them, teams from the sanitation department set off, immediately rapping down everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were dragged out of the park. Documenting the pictorial material appeared on the internet moments later.
The most gaest group of demonstrators took refuge in the vicinity of the kitchen in their campground, which was lying near the center of the park.
Some formed a roadblock and police began their methodical arrests.
About ten people at the center of the campground tied each other to each other.
And two people were tying up to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m. in the park, Mr. Kelly reported.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police comment.
Mr. Browne said approximately 142 people had been detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were made because of "an organisation of riots and the opposition to the arrest," he clarified.
The most senior police officer at the scene of the event was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the detective's commander in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "doverthe didn't participate in the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called up.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street Street, a block south of the park, barricades were erected.
From these places, police then developed a protective strip even further from Zuccotti Park.
Police officers were spotted at one of the scene, many of them equipped with shields, as they push people even further beyond the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a demonstrator was spotted south of Pine Street as he jumped onto the hood of the police car, and several others who were releasing air from the tires of the police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood came out of the crowd.
At the end of the surgery, one police officer and one protester were hospitalized.
Auxiliary workers' union to sue city for release
Unions representing hundreds of school auxiliaries who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that the redundancies were not necessary and, moreover, it was discrimination, because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The court is probably the last resort left by the members in the District Council area in their efforts to overturn the dismissal decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-seven-two school assistants, parental coordinators, and other staff who were among the city's worst-paid employees lost their jobs. Their dismissed members of the union described as the city's retribution for not allowing him access to a health care fund run by work crews last spring, using which the city wanted to stick a hole in the budget.
City officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One of the council members immediately countered by saying that the budget was not specifically mentioned in the budget for the dismissal of the auxiliary staff.
Officials at District Council 37 reported that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education to sue him. On Wednesday, they would call a press conference to formally announce the lawsuit at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiff's party will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as are most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, so she would not comment on the individual charges.
Under the draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the unions targeted the number of dismissed people in the city's poor parts of the city, seeking to support their claims of unfair conduct, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funds.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island section of the Staten Island section were not released at all, and in the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants lost their jobs, and 46 assistants were fired in parts of District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
He recalls that at the Public School 36 in Harlem, five of the eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: "This is not a neighborhood of full affluent parents who can provide funding to balance the deficit in the budget."
The Public School 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way the city was to calculate bonus funding for each of the loser enrolled.
The unions argue, among other things, that the headmasters of secondary schools may have been confused in the manner in which the document approving the dismissal of the parental coordinators was written.
The word "excess" was used to describe the action in the document, i.e. to cancel the position, even though the word is much more commonly used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available workers whose salutation is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been released," reads the complaint's draft, "and not merely moved to the database as available staff."
Mission over, Congress ready to accept deal on situation in Libya
Finally, the Republicans and the Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something in terms of the uprising in Libya.
Before that happened, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the reigning dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of United States troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate International Relations Committee will decide on the comments supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn), in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thanking the U.S. troops for "brass."
"With this statement, we want to applaud the courage of the people of Libya who started to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Belt of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic efforts."
The sentences in question may look innocent, but no debate about Libya has been an easy one so far.
During the summer, lawmakers from both sides kept arguing with each other and with the White House about the text of a series of statements to approve or, conversely, reject the United States' military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorising the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The motion was rejected in the House because of the differing views of the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the motion was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a measure that would stop funding for US operations in Libya.
This found the US mission in Libya literally in legislative purgatory - Congress criticized the way President Obama runs the mission, but it clearly did not irritate his members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The hesitatness of the congress was eventually overtaken by other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The Nato mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be prepared to act.
In its statement, the International Relations Committee "congraties the people of Libya for their immeasurable courage and admirable tenacity they have made in an attempt to free their people" and "chewage the men and women of the United States' armed forces, as well as their allies who have joined the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States at the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive the full support of the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be split back into two halves, as was the case with the approval of the June proposal?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's chief representative on the commission.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
There will be a vote in the House this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on the budget or other subject, which will be voted on by the entire House or the Senate.
For the time being, other lawmakers, despite considerable efforts, have yet to push their proposals to the vote itself.
The Goodlatt proposal is just one of the 68 amendments to the constitution presented in the Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same motion put forward to both the House and the Senate - and others were just minor variations of others.
In the House alone, you can find at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending."
While some of the proposals are identical, their proponents - especially aspiring Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authorism."
The revenue for budget regulation, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment to a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the number of periods in which congressional members could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods allowed to be in office as president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) has offered a number of additions that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
A lasting proposition remains an amendment banning the marriage of same-sex couples as well as an amendment banning the burning of the national flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in designing different additions, they do not significantly out of the average compared to previous years.
The 111. Congress offered 77 additions, while there were 66.
Their activity is even paing compared to the early 1990s, when, according to Senate library statistics, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
But they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment, which was added - 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Framped, but not defeated," Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after being injured at point-blank range by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along with a melody from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted more than a return to Congress to get better.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. You could see that the creation of sentences still gave her problems and needed help while walking.
The entire show documented her difficult convalescence, which was necessary due to a bullet-induced wound that had pierced her skull in the front, penetrated the left half of her brain, and out of her head at the back.
Surprisingly, three months ago, she returned to the House to triumphantly participate in the debt ceiling vote.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "suit."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Giffords, 41, responded, "Precatedly well."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour-long special of the "20/20" episode, which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special watched the entire convalescence of Gifford since the January 8 shooting.
In the videos recorded by Kelly in the first week, Giffords can be seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across the forehead.
While her husband cheers her, she can't do more than just lift one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair and the therapists are taught how to perform simple activities.
The nod of the head.
The lipstick.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords had spoken another word - "toast" as she demanded a change in her breakfast.
Videos aired by ABC show that music played a pivotal role for Giffords' recovery: the congresswoman sings on them along with the therapist on the melodies to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, told Sawyer that she could not remember anything from the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he didn't read newspaper articles to Gifford about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who was killed in the incident were.
The shooting is the suspect in the shooting, Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held at the Missoury prison, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of forensic drugs.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Terrible, horrible, horrible."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point his wife said during her recovery, "I lost."
"So I said to her at once, "Gabby, you've not lost," Kelly described.
"You just got beat up.
But you make it, pull yourself together, and come back even stronger than ever."
Military troops encounter compassion rather than respect
The event was a gala on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, and marines ran up past him.
The ceremonically dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
"Busmen and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who hosted the spring fundraiser.
The gala evening was attended by the then chairman of the Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition to him, Admiral Mike Mullen was also on the scene, but he saw the role of the military units somewhat differently.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respectable.
Thus the very opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the often aloof, sometimes celebrated by the American public.
The military is bordered by commerutately praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they regret the individual in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But the only way some can support us seem to be to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for army commanders who do not want to appear inomable or to spoil the public relations they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the troops returning from Vietnam had to face was far worse.
As a result, most of the words about regret are uttered in silence and in private among war veterans.
As the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat actions to serve as Marine Corps members, their father warned them that their service would be viewed by people outside the military from two angles.
From the point of view of some, he would feel respect and astonished for the enemy rebels to be defeated and visited exotic places.
But others will be wondering if "a bad, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took his place in Washington's government upon his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people interviewed interviewed subtly indicated whether, so soon after returning to the fight, he could withstand the stress associated with the work in Washington.
"When you talk about your service, you have to reckon with negative reactions," Cancian instructed his sons.
The military's concern stems in part from American indifference to the wars.
Successes on the battlefield rarely get a recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and finds little of its own benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer reckless with military heroism as it used to be in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition from politicians and the public is focused mainly on the suffering of the men in arms.
The soldiers are honoured for the number of events they have endured, the many friends they have lost, or for the extent of their injuries.
The military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, it will be decided whether the 28 women's and men's trial against the military will be initiated for allegedly inaction in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other claimants are prepared to sue.
The first-class soldier, Elizabeth Lyman, was 25 years old at the night of allegedly being raped by her military colleague and was at 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008, and she was heading to the barracks at the Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she came across her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, that they might have a little drink in her room.
"My warning light came on in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought: No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listen to my instincts."
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, the man walked over to her, threw her onto the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the military will await the verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donal Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The accused states that Gates and Rumsfeld have failed to fight the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The charges were filed in February by the Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. However, over the following months, their numbers grew to 28-25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military, and that the military, after the announcement of these sraers, failed in the investigation, punishment, punishment, and any pursuit of justice.
Burke says she's at the throat of the top-ranking Army commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in the position to prevent efforts to implement measures against such acts?
Burke also claims to have contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping together all the charges in this case - stacking all the eggs in one basket, as she puts it - she will file suits in multiple different cases if the pressure needs to be unleaspended.
The team defending the Ministry of Defence is led by U.S. Attorney General Neil MacBride, who, together with his associates, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy - essentially, the case is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for the injuries they have sustained as members of the armed forces.
Under a Supreme Court order in 1950 called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document reads.
The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is just a quintar: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clearly given front line.
In the wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers were killed between these wars - two-thirds of them in the fight.
The time has come for modernization to be modernized in the military, Burke explains.
She is not alone in her fight. In addition to her, the case is being handled by three other attorneys.
At the Yale Law School, visitors to a veteran's legal services seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for the supposedly developing an atmosphere promoting hatred of women.
Independently, the nonprofit organization of American Vietnam veterans is gathering the groundwork for its action against the military. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of the "personality disorder" allegedly found in rape victims for the military to have a pretext for their release - according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati, a group of human rights activists Service Women's Action Network, it is a perfectly normal practice.
Her group had already filed a motion for a lawsuit against the State Organisation for dealing with the veterans in December, accusing him of discriminatory practices that were to be carried out in the processing of requests for assistance by those who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented in Congress, presented by a group of senators and members from both political parties, and proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the Office for Preventing and Addressing Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attacks remains unannounced in most cases, and according to Pentagon's own estimates, the figure is equivalent to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that took place in that year.
The report issued in March is also dismantled by the level of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the military - half of the civil justice system - were taken to court in 2010.
Prosecutors in the Burke representative's case describe the attacks only as the first of a number of trauma.
For example, the first-class Private Lyman reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to take place.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to various members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of her attacker was found in her bed - from the wound she had given him on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing, during which she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned, as witnesses to the legend, in favour of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," Lyman says.
"I felt like I'd give birth right there on the spot - I ran out of the courtroom screaming.'
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't his trial. It was mine."
The Lymanians ordered a visit to a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, calling her ineligible service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed from the army without honour and therefore without the right to the right to the outing.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other prosecutors goes to the next stage or not, it's a long shot, says John Turley, Law professor at George Washington's Law.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to advance to the next stages of the hearing."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the aforementioned doctrine, which has been criticised since the first time she saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is behind for several decades because their duties do not give in to the same level of motivation stimuli and deterrent detergents.
He adds, "The chances are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen if the good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favour, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will collect hundreds of other people ready to sue and begin work on further cases concerning the subject.
"We will not continue to fight the military on this issue from which there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes first.
Won's eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another young man to present his anti-immigrant views online.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July murderous fury, left to 70 people in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not lonely in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer while preparing the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on the social networking site.
After this summer's tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easily - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them is not really that hard," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently released report by the British research team on European digital populism.
The Facebook personal information supply is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, saying that it was enough for scientists to simply use the ad on the site to simply use the advertisement for the site and, as a result, to determine with absolute precision the wanted demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
The Bartlett team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, then drew attention to them and sent out advertisements to them. However, instead of inviting them to the newly formed group through them or offered them some dietary products, they urged them to fill in a questionnaire that raised questions about their level of education, their relationship to violence, and optimism, given their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without even having to leave the office.
"This is a whole new way of conducting research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men who are irritable by the rising immigration rate.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with off-line activism are more sensible, democratic, and less violent than those who remain hidden behind the computer screenstposite."
The DEMOS team's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these sites to study everything, from health problems to social trends hiding in status updates, contributions to the walls, and the "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them provides three different data a day on average, making this social network a literal "information supernova" that is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic papers in whose name is the word Facebook has risen to nearly 800% compared to five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to do a survey of the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the party, which you'd never be allowed to go to," says Bartlett.
"All of this is downright Facebook - you're just going straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a socio-health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken hits on Facebook were much more at risk of the problem of alcoholism than the students who kept quiet about the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' peers should monitor the site and come forward with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunken statuses.
"The problem can't be solved unless you can't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno and director of the Center for the Health, Cenegom, Child Research Institute at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, told the Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify children at risk who we would not have had a chance to discover otherwise."
Facebook itself is constantly probing the data of its users.
The website's information team produced statistics on the context of the relationship statuses and the Valentine's Day, the 2010 voter turnout and the nation's satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information to which they had access - the proponents of internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information treasury available for research to others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the chance to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to give the page your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect off-line data. However, on-line data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users thought scientists could look at their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, on a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it to mean that the information was between them and their friends."
It is then also considered the question of the methodology.
Even in offline research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the wall is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who spent years researching new technologies, thinks that the pencil and notebook remain the best possible tool to be used in the research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cleer and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who has pleaded guilty to the two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "di.e." as a fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Knights Templar Knights of Norway," he said in court, where 500 people had gathered.
"I object to the Court of Justice because you were given a mandate by organizations supporting the ideology of hatred and because it promotes multiculturalism."
"I confess to my actions, but I don't admit any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could proclaim his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a prepared speech, to address relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from having any contact with the media for 4 teenas, and announced that the final authorities would have complete control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope of being able to look the Breiviks in the eye, others to make sure he was held firmly locked up.
They all took part in order to move the case to an early closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors of the attack told NRK.
"It was not pleasant, but for my part I can say that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I mentally moved on a bit further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On the arrival and departure to the building without difficulty, viewed by the journalists present and the survivors.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "odistance" movement, the judge found that he was not insane, and noted that there was no evidence that he had an accomplice.
It may be a consolation for some that the June 22 attacks appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically diminate the grief and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish she'd fall out like a monster, but he's not," a relative of one of the victims said.
"If I did, things would be a lot easier."
7 lessons learned from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie heading to cinemas this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people who compared him with Henry Ford - and elected him as his genius The greatest modern inventor.
At the recently re-encryed Jobs interview, which was dusted off for a special film that is heading to cinemas this week, it will be the fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and the workflows behind its products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-proclapreter member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who matches each detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a truly great idea is 90 per cent of their work... [but] there is still a long journey of mourning work between the excellent idea and the excellent resulting product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on TV's TV show The Triumph of Computer Fools, which was about the dawn of personal computers. During filming, a unique, more than one-hour interview took place.
By this time it had been a decade since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company, NeXT, and was eager to see how the general public would take to the internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely's entire interview was used on the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were told that they had been lost in the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs's death, however, the VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, that forms the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is famous for his relust to provide longer interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly thrilled to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking as to when you can see how Jobs thinks through the answer perfectly, to be as apt and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism surfaces, when Cringely's questions are impatient and poo-facing to get more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar, iPod or iPhone era, and it features terrifyingly prophetic ideas when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It is one thing to read the posthumous reviews of Jobs' career, but there is something raw and inspirational about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the flourish of his genius.
Here he has his own vision of what a thing could and should look like.
It didn't take long for him, and after he spoke his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run the business:
"During the years of the business, I always asked: Why do you do this? and the answer was always the same: Well, that's how it's just done."
No one knows why he does what he does, he never thinks about business-related things in depth.
I found out.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to simplify the accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the cost was recorded - often beginning with the "standard cost" sign, the amount of which he could only think about it. At that point he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool to guarantee that they could determine the commercial costs during a moment.
How he made the rascal on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Bod Box" he had built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to hack effectively into the phone company and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
A number of the devices have been written about this in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm, describing the Blue Box as a tool of power, is literally infectious.
It tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a paid phone and were switched from one AT&T network to another during the call, while using as many satellites as possible.
"We've traveled around the world at least half a while or so around the world, so when we shouted something to a paid phone, it came in from a second phone at the door a minute later," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we found that we could build ourselves a thing that was capable of managing infrastructure worth billions of dollars worldwide."
Two of us made a tiny thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I don't think Apple would have been created without it.
Jobs continues with a description of the prank he and Wozniak almost made to the end. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked to be spoken to by the Pope, posing as best as they did to Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, the more and more senior members of the Catholic Church were summoned to speak to the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was only before they woke the Pope to the phone that the pair laughed and put down the receiver.
How he fell in love with technology (and telephoned with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and he was looking for spare parts to build a vibration, he found the number on Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs already had a secure summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I met at the time, and it was my view of what a company it really is and how to treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees to visit the company's research lab at Palo Alto, where he saw the "first desktop computer ever made."
It was the size of a suitcase, he had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I was moving up and up at HP, hanging around that computer and starting to write programs for him.
How to devise innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks during the interview about how he devises new products on the run.
In the early days of his career, when he set out to sell a few boarding records, a customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days at his disposal, during which he had to devise, assemble, and deliver the finished device.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing computer mice:
"I remember arguing quite wildly . . . they yelled at me that it would take five years [estate a mouse that would cost $300 to be at a time), when I got tired of it, I came out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies are running out of breath:
A long time before he led the Apple resurrection, Jobs prudently predicted that many industrial leaders would falle in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work with IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, and then what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company could no longer be more successful.
At that point, sales and marketing are in the system, so the companies are run by the people in charge of this, while the people in charge of their own products are out of the decision-making process.
The technology genius who has led the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea about good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned literally the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times the size of it, it could have been Microsoft's '90s...
But instead of winning, they set up a loss.
How he sees innovation as a form of art:
"Between the excellent idea and the excellent resulting product, there is still a long way to go and work... and as the great idea develops, it also changes and grows."
During that time, you learn a lot about him.
You have to accept a whole series of compromises - certain things you just can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things in mind - different concepts - and compose them together...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a certain way, you try to project them into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I was never ashamed of the fact that I had stolen the best ideas.
The Macintosh Society was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were brilliant musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, coincidentally, the best computer experts in the world.
If it weren't for computers and new technologies, they'd do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the Healthcare Act at the time of their case being handled by a court
The day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to hear the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a gala dinner sponsored by a law firm to attend the hearing.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the submitted motions.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit brought by the 26 states challenging the radical overhaul of health care passed by Congress last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges have agreed to hear the suit, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, the outcome of which will further stir up the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will face the court of the court and tries to refute the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society's annual dinner, which has been engaged in defending conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake in the process.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after a court discussion on the subject of the case.
It was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the Republican's top Senate official and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And the listing of the guests? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: These pair of judges have been attending the Federalist Society's event for years.
Nor is it anything that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct to which the lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which states that "the judge may participate in events that are currently associated and other organisations are organising to obtain funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, a guest of honour, or be given on the agenda of the event."
Still, Scalia and Thomas's relationship with the two law firms performing in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, were more than enough to alert activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contradicting the claims of several judges that the Supreme Court behaves under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dined at the social benefit together with the legal representatives awaiting the case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermine the legs with all the claims of detention, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little sympathy to their critics, saying that they also combined their courteseches without any problems with actions by groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-ranking conservative activist.
Moreover, the Conservatives argue that the ethical problem lies mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as Prosecutor General under President Obama when the first objections to the law emerged in court.
Kagan's critics are pressuring her to renby her involvement in the case, claiming that she was fighting for the law back then to be unbiased now.
Kagan gave no suggestion that she was about to resign.
Boeing wins record-breaking deal for $18 billion of jet aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 two-stilka Boeing 777 jet aircraft with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it's usually no cause for celebration.
But if the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a combined record $18 billion, that's a different story.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the contract: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the airline in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing announced its biggest order in history in terms of the denomin value for commercial aircraft - 50 two-clich jet Boeing 777.
The sensational contract came from the airline Emirates, based in Dubai.
Boeing told the Dubai Air Show at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline had the option to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, which would allow the total value of the contract to rise to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes also called a Dreamliner, which boasted significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the country's oil-leaning nations.
This means that they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but the rise in the price of fuel - mostly damaging to the airline, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country alone makes money from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as with other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders to increase fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The contract from Emirates is consolidating Boeaing's leading position in the broad-huscane aircraft market and is driving into the tightrope company Airbus SAS, which wanted to try to break Boeing's dominance with its transport model A350.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus officials announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, the 777-9300ER, would be postponed.
The postponing was therefore that customers demanded a greater utility load on the aircraft and range, so the manufacturer took the time to give the aircraft more engine power.
Boeing Co's events rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
The Mexican president's sister appears to have been defeated in the Michsian election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto's PRI, was helped by drug traffickers in pursuit of the governor's chair.
Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost the governor's post to Michoacán in the violent state election. She subsequently said on Monday that one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the Western State's governor's election for Fausto Vallej by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of the members of organised crime into the whole electoral process and especially into yesterday's elections itself is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for the whole of our country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in an interview with the radio the day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the polling group... confiscated the ballot box, built roadblocks... and let people vote on order for PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he plans to return to power soon, and winning the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Calderon, who was still in the lead the day before the election.
Calderon, the Conservative candidate for her brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
Third ranked, Silvano Aureolis, the candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now controlled the governor's office. For the fractious and bad luck of the persecuted party, it is a very unfortunate loss before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state, named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to recognize the results.
For a long time, Michoacán was controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is President Calderon's native state of birth and it was in Michoacán that he launched a military fight against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence persised.
The mayor of the PAN party, a supporter of Luisa Maria Calderon, was assassinated only a week before the election, and many candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
However the results of the elections in Michoacán look as they do for the PRI party, the victory will help the party to gain a new boost.
The expected PRI representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington, congratulated Vallej, and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save Eurozone
Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help rescue the Eurozone ahead of its major debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall downturn in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of the economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, the CEO of the ADB Bank, based in Manila, said that the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help help the monetary bloc's rapid recovery through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the states of the Bric group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European difficulties "too dispassionately" and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership, would help to iggate the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's certainly not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been heavily tested for months by a major debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's growing debt crisis has raised concerns about the global economy being dragged into recession again, and calls to come to the emergue of the newly flourishing front-run economies and help the Eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag had predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the European Union's financial assistance to the financial assistance fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - would give the Asian partners European countries more bargaining opportunities.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We stand before a tough task and we must maintain a high growth rate."
"This is not an alternative, it is a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that emerging economies such as India's emerging economies have nothing to do to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be very difficult to explain to Europe's aid to 1.2 billion people in India, with 800 million of them living from USD 2 or less per day.
"Someday they might find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their holidays on the beaches, which would be difficult to explain," he noted.
Similarly, Lee Howell, the Director General of the World Economic Forum, questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis was threatening a 'dangerous domino effect'.
The bank's forecast to have 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 is now facing a "risis of decline" due to the European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must create "unpredictable spending plans" to be protected from decline and significant capital outflows from their economies.
A Pentagon warning about possible defense cuts
In Congress, on Monday in Congress, Defense Minister Leon Panetta gave a big swipe at the boiler, warning that looming, automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will already have to spend a $450 billion cut in the budget over the next ten years, but it is now fearing a reduction of an additional $600 billion if Congress fails to reach an spending deal.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the entire department," the Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress's inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called attachment would cause a 23% flat-rate decline and a halt to many new projects.
"Due to such a huge reduction, used in this reckolds, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipbuilding projects - you cannot buy only three-quarters of the building or the ship. Moreover, there could be serious damage to further modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian staff, and as the reductions are to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake with the beliefs of those who cared for our army and seriously damage its readiness."
Eventually, the cuts will also affect the combat units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this obstettment, the operations there will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts to the contract staff, too, resulting in delays in the agreed contracts supporting the war efforts of our people."
"The stocks of paid staff will be lowered, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and the subsequent disruption of legal and political support."
Both Senators had written off the Panetts ten days ago, asking for details regarding the potential effects on the Department of Defense's automatic cuts.
"The consequences of the command of the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released the Panetto letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign off on."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"We will only see if the Panetta letter and the fresh warnings will increase the pressure on Congress approving the budget and intensify the votes calling to omit the Pentagon from the list of cut-down areas.
The Panetta had been increasingly open in interviews in conversations about possible cuts, even though he had moved to his senior position at the Pentagon with years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was in a fierce battle.
At a week-long press conference held for a week, the Defense Minister hinted at a brief picture of what his department might expect - the army's shell, but inside which the core would be missing.
"It will be like a ship without sailors."
"She'll be like an ammunition-free brigade."
"He'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," the Pentagon's speech said at the start of the Pentagon speech.
"She'll be like a forceless unit with no morality, unprepared and incapable of coming to terms with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In an annex, supplied with the letter to McCain and Graham, the Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; a significant reduction in the possibilities of drops and deployment around the world; the anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, the Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could be expected to be terminated, including those already being tested, as well as those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included the F35 project, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new offshore combat ship and a new ground-based combat vehicle to replace the Army and the Marines with a Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which is needed to address possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A glimpse of recent newspaper headlines suggests how serious and pervasive lies and deceitfulness are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing him of sexually harassing several women - both parties claiming that the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury while trying to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught calling US President Barrack Obama with a microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to ruin the entire career and to bark the stability of many countries.
New York's congressman and online exhibitionist, Anthony Weiner, made a fool of himself by releasing information that was immediately refuted by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of using the funds of his campaign to try to conceal his illegitimate affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that tumbled around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
It's crawling with stories about cheating at school and university.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make them look good in their assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise send a message that a lie and a scam are acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show that on a single day, you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers had lied three times in the first minutes of their first meeting in their lives.
Determining lies, or "recognizing lies," is a necessary skill that should be adopted by everyone, for personal or professional reasons.
But it is not a social game that is similar to, shall we say, Sharad, when one shouts out: "I have you". Recognition of deception is a serious science industry working with scientific data collected during the past six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the research results is that most of the old myths about the lie have been disproved.
Liars feel like they're looking into your eyes.
It's not like they're stuttering, stuttering, blushing or frockle.
However, do not infer from the fact that it is somehow difficult to spot and detect liar.
A trained lie identifier can detect the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are made and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a large and evolving industry on the recognition of lies, and it is clear that revealing deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be very helpful in today's complex world - especially if your work duties include hiring, hosting interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them relax in alertness, directing their emotions, and intuitively aware of how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverti lies more often than introverti, that men uttering more "besty" lies, while women call more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they say tend to be "inoffensive").
We also know that if you are seen as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's normal behaviour.
This is called "initial observation."
Thanks to him, he will have a later finding out with what to compare with.
Notice the subject's posture, his laughter, his work with the voice.
You should know if someone is routinely tapping your legs all the time so you don't improperly charge him of a lie just because he starts tapping with his foot in the middle of the meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behaviour.
But take this only as warning signals, not as evidence of a lie.
People who pronin the lie can stop moving the upper half of their body when they try to remember their imaginary story, they can turn the toes of their shoes to the door, bend to the exit, significantly change their posture, or show "release after the interview" - an exaggerated relief of relief and a change of position when the confession is difficult to do after them.
The people conducting interviews often give a false signal that the interview is over, only to see what the relief will look like after it is over.
Also, take the subject's language.
The famous story about how Scott Peterson once missed and used the previous tense when he claimed that his murdered woman was alive, which ran a nationwide search for her body.
The deceitful individuals can also be aloof: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat the difficult question.
The most common verbal features are very slight.
Someone can use a lot of "eating language" when they answer the difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
We don't learn much of the facts in that answer, and it's often another warning signal.
There is no spell to reveal every lie, but it is possible to master the skills by which the lie can be traced.
Using these skills, one will have a better chance of not flying in one's personal and work-related liar and the imposter.
The controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of a delay in US government approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - turning the unions against each other, but reassuring the environmentalists - a company to build a pipeline that announced that it was willing to redirect the project to set things in motion again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would move the planned pipeline route from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska and is confident that the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the non-Breaking government.
TransCanada's Alex Pourbax's bug, argues that the company is confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved even though it will take a different route.
That announcement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced last week that it was postponing a decision on the federal permit of the project, from which it would not carry out studies of possible alternative routes by which it would be possible to interfere with the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the waterproofing layer of Ogallala, the sprawling underground water supply pool.
"This is really a move forward," Republican representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental report commissioned by the State Department would likely push back any decision until 2013, a year after next year's election, but the authorities refuse to play any role in the decision of politics.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will be connected by Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flow through it every day.
This path will need to be interseced by six states.
This project is utterly hated by environmentalists, but loved by the work platoon, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislature opposed the plan, considering introducing laws that would force the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the water-shaven Ogallal layer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the environmental impact commissioned by the State Department found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but a source in the energy industry said that the inspector general from the Ministry commissioned a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
It was once whether the lobbyist hired to TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, was not in a conflict of interest program.
Others, whether the firm that was hired for the original study was chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of having a toddler vomited in fear
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle raided the lobby of their Manhattan house furiously and terrified their daughter so much that she threw up in fear.
The singer's "Lady Marmalade" performances spooked the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "in personality, sleep disorder" and "an increased fear of strangers," her family says in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 of last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were planning a family trip.
When Kevin Monk brought the car, Roseanna Monk and her luggage went down to the vestibule of their home in the Riverside Boulevard section, carrying Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a moment and put down the baby for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and I left to get her to pick her up."
LaBelle reprimanded the pregnant woman in exasperation.
"In an aggressive tone, she said to me, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,"" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care about your opinion.""
She became enraged and began to speak dirty - shouting loudly with the gleanest expressions...
She had a bottle of water on her and started to lick water on me.
She claims that Genevieve had a hysterical fit.
"I said to the woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter.""" said the child's mother.
LaBelle lunged at her mother - who was still in Genevieve's arms - and had to be stopped by her entourage, who subsequently dragged her to the waiting car, Roseanna Monk testified.
The daughter, meanwhile, was screaming so much that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but received no reply.
Lawyer and spokesperson for the singer LaBelle are not responding to our phone calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages, but the family attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case to the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the extra money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed at the school teacher holding an 18-month-old baby in the arms."
Climate's Inconstigation hampered the economy
During the first year of Mario López's government, unemployment and unreliability rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment fell, and with them the economy
This year is the year 2011 to the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, which is called the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth was observed and even a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, curtailed the growth opportunities for the state economy, responsible for reducing economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the area of agriculture, there was a historic 31.16% decline in agriculture, which also disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and partial damage to the other 21.07% were found. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, maize and pea.
The decline in economic activity until November was caused by a constant rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the state's unemployment rate recorded an increased increase during the first three quarters. From January to March, the population of Sinaloa was unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and, between July and August, the average unemployment rate rose further, reaching a value of 6.19%, representing around 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, the number of unemployed people increased by 18,969.
Less liquidity
Multiple factors are to blame for unemployment during the year in the state of Sinaloa. According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. These include, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to the limitations of resources due to legislation passed by a congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. It is not easy for people who are illegally seizing dollars, to earn it, to invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Stopping migration
López Cervantes said the demographic factor was also involved in the rise in unemployment.
"The number of people going abroad to work in the United States has decreased, both for reasons of difficult entry and also because of the fact that even if these people cross the country, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising," he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the Sinaloa labour market is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the area of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistical and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state are working without paying benefits to the social security administration.
Adding to unemployment and unreliability are other features of the labour market, such as low salaries. In this administrative territory, the lowest salaries are made of the country, as reported by the registries of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Labor Secretariat and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa working state was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average, which is at 7,375 pesetas.
Couple of foreign direct investment
Along with a decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment, the sharpest drop in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, between January and June, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,6970, a decline of 87.74%, up from $51,431,312 for the same period the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government lists investments of 17,280 million pesetas per year. These investments were mainly directed to services businesses.
Dlluh
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state asked the state Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion peso. This would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2,600 million peso. By November, no debt gains were recorded, in any of the national economy sectors.
Reactions
According to business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario López Valdés pointed out the lack of management capabilities of the government.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the National Chamber of the Transforming Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of aligning the will of the individual sectors, including the state's very government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really tiny during this year. We need to work intensively to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012, we need to redouble our efforts, there was a lack of harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the correct and synchronised functioning of this new government. Hopefully, next year will be much better," he said.
The Grease of the Economy
Loredo López said that the frosts events at the beginning of the year halted the state economy and curtailed its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frost. One of the main consequences was a slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to restore dynamism that would allow an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services to be achieved. That is why, at the end of the year, we found ourselves well below the expected forecasts," he said.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employee Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, the state should be pushed to more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we observe that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the objectives and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resources that Sinaloa has is mobilised," he said.
The work ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future to better manage the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in different areas, there have been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan," he said.
He said the current administration had shown progress in public policy leadership.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the government is trying to be welcoming. I can say that the work done is seen here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted for 8 kg of marijuana
The Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100-day fines for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office of the Republic reported that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of the crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela's Sandoval was apprehended by the Mexican Army's forces on 7 June 2010 on an errand in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80, in the district of El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was driving a pick up white-coloured pick in a truck. In the car on the shelf he had a black bag and a small backpack in the passenger seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained available to the Judge of the Second Unit and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of Legal Impact of Crimes.
Gonor for contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Hábitat, Rescuing Public Places and 3x1 for Migrants, face the risk of being brought to an end or of being in a long run because of the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Urban Social Development said that if construction work has moved forward so far, there is now a risk that the government of the state will not be able to secure the appropriate supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million peso for three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million peso. The state accounts for 25%. Up to this time, only the Federation and the city have supplied the resources for the work, so it is possible that the projects will be delayed.
"They are to secure almost 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we have not received anything at all. Even though we should have received a part in July," he said. "To waste no time, we have started the projects and continue very successfully, but we lack the money."
He said that last year under the administration of Jesús Aguilar, Padilla, the state did not meet the respective deliveries, so at the beginning of the new period the city had to apply for a loan in order to be able to pay for more than 7 million not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the mentioned programs this year, we had to raise funds to cover what the state did not finish," he explained.
Despite the fact that there was a promise from state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request from Armandu Villarreal, the secretary for administration and finance had been sent to expedite the proceedings and the corresponding percentages to arrive as soon as possible.
"They were to provide us with 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even gotten a peso yet."
The Court of Justice approves 'end of analogue broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogous digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional action brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the Presidium Decade, which wants to expedite the so-called "swelling of analogous signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. It noted that the necessary eight votes were not found to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree sticking out the individual steps that would lead to the transition to Earth's digital television.
With that result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed, in the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes required to enable the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decrees, which thus remains valid.
The draft judgment drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero submits the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter that is reserved under the Act to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), thus violating the principles of hierarchical subordination and exceptions to the law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decrees. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted the demands and suspended the application of the decrees and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitalisation.
The ministerial meeting also decided to dismiss the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering the discussion of the proposal also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not endorse the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the Federal executive could not structure measures through the general standards of the measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if it did, it would be offended by the regulatory authority's autonomy," and recalled that planning for public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector was the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The digital analog-alignation is one of the biggest changes experienced by the world in recent years. It is related to better use of the radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying the change would be to delay the benefits of digitisation, which requires decisions on the public interest. Digitisation has not only a technical dimension, but "also concerns economic, social, political and national security issues."
As he pointed out, these questions "require to operate the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences that the Constitution confers in the hands of the government of the state."
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and did so through their governments, even though they had at their disposal the highly specialised technical bodies.
He said that it was not possible for the government, by issuing a dissenting decree that to some extent interfold in the area of congressional powers, to introduce in the area of administration to comply with laws prepared by the legislative power.
In Michoacán, they analyze the "voice" census option
According to the PREP's published data, the difference between the first and second-place seats in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The "voice" vote counted in this year's elections in Michoacán, where, in line with the data published by the Preliminary Election Results Programme (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been included by the votes of 879 out of a total of 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the chairwoman of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a number of measures to harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was to expire in that parliamentary term, and Governor Leonel Godo Rangel neglected to be published within the deadline set by the Act of Official Journal of the State Journal, saying he had any objections to them.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) settled a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the head of state's vote in the constitutional reform "unsuccessful and illegal" because it has no right to "neither to approve or veto them."
Asked about the possibility of "voice-on-voice" censuses, María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that the approval of the relevant IEM measures by the IEM General Council would make it possible for both a partial and overall census to be carried out by the local electoral body.
In this way, a partial counting of votes, one or more electoral parcels, will be possible to make under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no minutes of counting and calculation in the relevant box or not available to the President; or if errors have been made and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, the total recount of the votes in all ballot boxes will be made if there is evidence suggesting that the difference between the potential election winner and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever the explicit request of a representative of the party and/or coalition that proposed the candidate in second place appears at the start of the session.
A total recount will also be made when, after a proper addition, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the second candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate has finished in second place. In that case, the electoral parcels for which a partial census has been taken will be eliminated.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His will of his will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday there will be a ceremony and a memorial service.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish that his ashes would be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honours, along with the other persons who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortése family returned to the capital, Coahuila, aboard a plane of the Mexican Air Force. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located on Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American Football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Nouhali Mountains. This is how he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the height of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young and joined the flight school Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it, because they said he even drove a truck, however he always went to his dream to become a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "as a sooner as soon as he came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as she did when he brought Martha Sahagoun to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died doing what he liked best in his life: the driving of the plane.
They said their last goodbye
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, the lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honours that Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technology High School in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled in both his studies and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past few days after the helicopter he was flying crashed. Also on board was the secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the salten native Bacio Cortése (climped) arrived through the funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under the guidance of Major Jaime Martinez in the area, where his family, his daughter Amanda, and wife Cristina, the mother, the siblings and other relatives, the students and teachers gathered.
Three abandoned dead bodies found on Cadereyta NL farm
Hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who were detained in the area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of the three men murdered by gunfire in various parts of the body and head were found at the abandoned farmhouse of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place on the 1.5-kilometre road from Cadereyt to Santiago, level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the hut with the beige-kage fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked in, from a distance of approximately three meters, they noticed the corpses of three people, so they immediately alerted the relevant authorities.
One of the people wore a yellow sports T-shirt and dark cotton trousers and was not wearing shoes. Next to it was also in a white-striped sports T-shirt.
A few yards away, the body of another person dressed in a red sports T-shirt and blue cotton trousers was the body.
The three of them lay face-down facing the ground.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three people were probably murdered in a different location because bullets were not found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime of the other, as well as a series of bullet-trokee traces, both on the building and on the doors.
Cadereyt arrested 11 suspects
The secretary of the National Defense introduced 11 people, including juveniles who were members of the criminal group she operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and who are associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to the information released during the first attempt on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and one detained person was freed.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured. They confirmed that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas."
Another raid took place on 12 November at 6 a.m. Military staff was on the rounds in the Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyta when he noticed a car without a license plate and two people.
After stopping the car, they inspected and discovered one rifle, a shell casing and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Then, following these accounts, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was detained at about 14:00 on 13 November. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government to be appointed on Wednesday
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government to face the crisis that holds the country over the abyss of economic disaster.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to present him with a new government facing the crisis that holds the country's gauro of economic disaster and which has put the eurozone in danger.
The presidential palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
It is expected to present a government composed mostly of technocrats, though it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks he had with the political parties in an attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The question is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, at a much shorter time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to combat the political and financial crisis that has pushed the debt levels up to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by the former European Commissioner, Monti, must approve a harsh austerity package required by European leaders, only this will it be possible to restore Italy's downtrored credibility.
There is a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry up. Due to the instability of the markets, the interest on Italian BTPs, with a 10-year maturity of the 7 percentage, the level where Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue exceeded.
Emma Marcegaglia, chairwoman of the Italian employers' organisation Confindustria, told reporters after the meeting with Montim: 'We said we would support this government very much'.
We believe that this government is a last resort to getting Italy out of this burning situation.
Monti's hopes for success have been significantly compounded by support from PDL Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign by the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
Support for the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because, until now, many of its members have opposed the technocratic-m-cerned government, which is being formed by Monti.
Support for Parliament
The new Monti government must have the strong support of parliament to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti's failure could be a disaster.
Monti opened negotiations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations on Monday.
The bike will end the negotiations on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who made it possible to advance very quickly in response to the crisis.
After a brief drop at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest rates have returned to the critical threshold, responding to the uncertainty of whether the new Prime Minister will re-hit success.
To save Italy, whose public debt is €1.8 trillion, would be beyond the capabilities of the eurozone's current financial reserves.
Monti said that his government should last in power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that say politicians would only give him time to implement reforms and then call an early election.
Monti said that he would like to integrate politicians into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must be made up of experts to take Italy out of the predicament that the country has come to because of the financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual distrust and disapproval between the parties were complicated by an attempt to integrate political figures into the government.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten will exceed the threshold of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 players called up to reach the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the side of Costa Rica if we compare the 22 players from the two countries who met today for a friendly at the 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, FIFA's one-month-old rating, have a wide range of intercurry A-class A matches to their credit, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who is the only one to play 50 international matches.
He reached that figure last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
The Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star and the powerful English First League clubs, have maintained their intense activity at the league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches in the European Cups as the Champions League for over a year.
To the previous one we must also add the experience of the national team in the complicated knockout matches at the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team is to be played by goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who drew on former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 international matches last Saturday before England.
Casillas will also take on Costa Rica today and will set a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, the key player for Barcelona, has 106 matches to his tame.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players with a hundred matches to their ten. Among them, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and midfielder Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol also came close to the 100 with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc Fábregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the side of Costa Rica and close to Michael Uman, left winger Júnior Díaz moves with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with the 45th.
There were only 5 tops the 30-game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 games in Spain, they feature Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 games, it's Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica, Víctor Bolívar, has only one, and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour to celebrate 20 years of existence
"The travel of Costa Rica is a dream that becomes reality"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band was ready to offer one of the best gigs at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have waited more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that the opportunity to play in Costa Rica represents a dream come true.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively to Viva from Brazil last week, said.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20th.
He will perform this day at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. with the angel band The X and the national musicians of Las Robertas.
This is a sample from the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the La Nación website on the internet.
It's a dream come true for your Costa Rican supporters. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream, which is becoming reality.
In South and Central America, we were barely the second and experience to date was great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on holiday. It's a beautiful country and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're so happy to be able to bring you our music.
I ask because they literally adore the group here, the fans experience these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most shiny supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people are already referring to the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Is that giving you more pressure?
Some of the biggest shows we've shown in the last 21 years have been made in a matter of weeks.
We put on some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to get into shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like to think of the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves fitting to surf?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. the waves here are unbelievable.
My friends go to surf in Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or to Mexico. These are the best surfing places, and so we found out about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've set up a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan to present in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no restrictions on what we can't do.
We will try to put on the best possible show with a variety of tracks. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What're?
I think in part it's because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different tracks, so it's hard to choose what songs we'll play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that maybe we've already forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, which is why I think it is more interesting for the people as well.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure.
First, I think that none of us could have imagined that we would be in one big rock band and that we would stay in it for more than 20 years.
We realise how much we have been given and are surprised to see that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and like to make music.
We are lucky to be able to look at the places we have always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honour for us to be a part of this group in which the great greats are represented.
The people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement emerges from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
A group emerges from time to time, but it is far less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at once.
We are proud of this and we are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some of them.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky to be all our friends and we are honored to be a part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think, first of all, we are all fortunate to be still in this world and secondly, the fact that we are constantly interested in each other's part.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone with sufficient freedom to experiment themselves.
We trust each other, we appreciate each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find the balance?
The way we grew, it was gradually getting easier to find a balance.
We try not to go too much on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of the crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you remind yourself that you have to respect the music and what you've given it. You mustn't get carried away by being famous, rock stars. Neither of us really cared about this.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we were writing great songs and at the beginning it was something spectacular.
We had been in existence as a band for three years and we never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started out in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy how unbelievable he was, how much I laughed with him. It was always a pleasure to work with him, laugh, talk about music or football and many others.
He was an incredible person and we miss him so much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the opening actle.
Yes, the production sent us videos with several designs and we liked this group the most. That's why we are curious about what Las Robertas will offer live and have to be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing he thinks of.
Who is influencing you as a bassist?
Lots of people.
I first think of Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them I could talk all night about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge, even though it is no longer in vogue?
I think we've all always felt a little separated from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine the groups I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that were made at the same time. And if music like this is still this valid today, it's something great because it's music worth listening to and the likes of Mudhoney players today are playing better music than ever before.
At the beginning, your music was a slightly grim-murdic and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I have a feeling that there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe, which are considered very gloomy, although they may sound like positive.
By both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're songs of deep dark.
I think when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in the family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent this for me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized at a public hospital on Tuesday to test him for the muscle loss he has suffered in the lower extremes, his attending physician reported.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-07) suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is already under control by doctors.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the TV station Canal N that Fujimori would undergo tests in three days at the National Institute of Neo-patteraphy, where they should find out why he is in pain and why he is losing his strength in his lower extremities.
Aguinaga said that, in his view, Fujimori might be pardoned on humanitarian grounds, but the former president himself does not want a pardon because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and these problems were added by other ailles such as severe erosive gastritis, a cohrit cyst, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Special Police Operations Headquarters.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murdering squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguayan president, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businesses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging meeting of meetings with politicians, trade and representatives of the Uruguyas community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan Presidential Office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be used to exchange information on political matters between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office posted on its website.
According to local media outtown, Mujica will seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be removed from the international community. This statement drew a negative opinion from Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairmanised by the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world's most powerful developing and developed countries. With the Latin American country in question, an information exchange agreement is to be concluded from January this year to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretise the Fiscal Exchange Agreements to come off the "blacklist" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to which countries that have not established all the required international tax cooperation standards.
From a business point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have closed the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has made the exchange of goods between the two countries strengthened.
The bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to the "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clandom of villain Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, has been formed from the start to take advantage of all the characteristics offered by the portable Nintendo 3DS console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use your glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to tell how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said a press official specialized in Nintendo, Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is the "Nintendo's first video game created specifically for this carrier" because until now, successful films such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were the adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to the fact that the picture is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "releascence" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that the "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have surpassed this level, you can tackle the "second round" at the game's levels, which are more challenging this time around.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the event. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to overcome all sorts of challenges and "not underwage to optical illusions."
This new emergence of Super Maria in 3D is also expected to return the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays into the notes for those who watch the saga and repeat the successful formula from previous episodes. It is that the bearded man's plumber will have to undergo dangerous, dulled platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds the news in the movements, in the surrounding area, in disguises and also among the enemies, the "playful" Luigi will also appear.
Colom approves extradition of Portallo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has ceded steps to the extradition of former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a $70 million laundering conspiracy.
This is the end of the process aimed at ensuring that Guatemala responds to a request from the northern country requesting the extradition of Portillo to be able to be tried.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and executive authority, and that he was in mind that the Criminal Court had already ordered extradition.
He assured that during his mandate he "dovigorated" into court decisions and allowed all extradites that had reached his desk.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín for murder and grievous bodily harm, and Edgar Estrad Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
Colom's move marks a move by the execution after all the judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to lead the trial against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala has been resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty in the matter of embezzling the $120 million of the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency, a process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and brought the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in a state of emergency
The organization was formed to help children without education, not to be on the fringes of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support organisation is very important: the 6,000 young people who were threatened with social exclusion have been helped. The organisation has been helping them to overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs obtained for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present a record as part of a solemn act that took place in the former manufacturing premises of the Fabra i Coats factory, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986, to help young people with low education, out of work, dealing with drug addiction or in a situation where they might fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of the organisations and institutions that have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unified nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the president of the Generalitat, Arturo Mas, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, the ceremony, were attended by former Socialist Education Adviser, Ernest Maragall, and former deputy mayors and current environmental-socialist councillor, Ricard Goma.
The Grand Hall of Fabra and Coats were also attended by the current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Social Works General Director at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove originated in a very difficult time and that today also offers a number of obstacles, but added that the work the association has brought to this day "is a good foundation."
The president cited Trinijove as an example of how to combat adverse circumstances and how to encourage people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organisation and for the work he does," he said.
There was the eviction of a seigning house hosting gigantic parties
The avert of themers appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the neighbours of Number 51 on Balmes Street is finally over.
Yesterday, at noon yesterday, 12 people voluntarily left the building they were occupying illegally and organizing gigantic parties that woke up neighbors. They left the building by court order and without the police having to intervene.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From now on, entry will be guarded," the caretaker said.
The occupiers, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electric and partly water equipment, in addition to painting the walls and leaving the garbage after all kinds, especially the cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments held huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a disco, the Balmes 51 which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that sales had fallen by 80% while the building was staffed.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupiers of the building made it unfair to competition because they sold drinks for €3, whereas the disco costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the neighbours' lawsuits because of the noise. But the problems were not caused by the discotheque's visitors, but by the residents of the occupation of the house and especially those who attended the parties, whose frequency and intensity had increased in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the neighborhood.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have been forgiven her rent for nine months.
The municipal police also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbours in the past few weeks about the situation.
Last week, the chairman of the city's public-fousing party's PP group at the town hall, demanded that "the building be evicted immediately and end the civil cohabitation problems suffered by the neighbours and the destruction of the area."
The president of the Peoples explained that only one floor had been taken by the summer, but in recent months the occupiers had reached all the floors of the building and into almost all the flats, and in one of them there were even thefts.
In this respect, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against the civil liability that took place in the building."
Yesterday, the city's police department also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 a.m., police got into Building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the trial, which entails more than the polemic about the royalties
The 16-gate city tender opens the debate about the role of the Collserola Park in Barcelona.
By the mid-1980s, at the height of the already defunct-up-folk Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality printed out several pamphlets to support the Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as the large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented with a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the CMB was lost in 1987, the park returned to the mind of many as the upper boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not navigate the north-facing south, but up (up) - down (sea).
Collserola qualifying as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the boars instead of the Yogi bear.
Such a position until September, when City Hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entry gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, plays more into the idea of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to put the gate on the field.
So there is only one question: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both in terms of purely organisational and reflection on the city, this issue becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already a theme as witred as when the two members of this old cast of the chosen one shake hands at the rendezvous in the elevator.
And it was this feat that triggered one of the rare coincutations between what three Barcelona architects and the forward university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection process has merit.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side has been written about, "it is necessary" to discuss the "Hate Party," so that Ildefons Cerdo's speech about the green apples was not brought to an end.
"We have to start from the principle that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gates to Collserola" bears a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a delimitation of the zones where it is possible to operate."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayon, with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that offers "some dangers."
The dangers of the "uncertainness posed by the public place project today" after the experience of the 1980s, which had a "his swan singing" in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very demarcation of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Simple to define is to take the next step," that is, in principle, to move one step further.
"It is necessary to bear in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus more detail on the question, Modol believes that the Collserol valley slope can be "considered a park" but not the Barcelona section, for reasons of purely topographic.
Modol also recalled that there is already a work carried out by the Patronat de Collserola, which "shters up in the rubbish dump," although it welcomes the fact that the town hall is offering its board to intervene in the project from the "first moment."
Moreover, he understands that the proximity to the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but "pall to doubt" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about the skills" to be created, which needs to be created: 'Architects should only be tools'.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question given to the question given to the game's name is complicated because the Collserola's global vision is missing from the documentation for the selection process: "A 16 tenders have been launched to deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea - but there is no longitudinal study looking at the area and to see it as a whole."
This causes him to apply for all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the one-gate project may run into the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the City Hall should guarantee that the band immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should be secured for the full length of the equipment zone to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino pardoned to Jonas Larrazábal, who will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal commissioner, Cadino Red, p p p p p p p p p p p.m. at the trial in which he was prosecuted for allegedly blackmail.
Manuel Jonas Larrazal has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal commissioner Casino Red p p p p p p p p p pp by the Second Criminal Court in that district hearing an extortion case in which the mayor of Monterrey's brother was indicted.
Following the Casino Royale bombing, Casina Red's owner, Sergio Gil García, released a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás was asked to pay for an economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Hall to make it illegal to operate in a betting home.
Following a public indictment, the State Prosecutor's Office launched the prosecution of the brother of the Pan-Panist mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
He was then transferred to 4 hours before the Public Ministry's Agent No 3 for property offences, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the capital.
He remained at this point for the following 49 days after a second imprisonment was handed down and a Public Ministry agent refuted the possibility of complicity or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was taken to the Criminal Court in Cadereyt on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with the sum of one and a half million peso. However, he remained only a few hours in a mid-specting prison because he was being threatened with death.
Leaders allowed him to stay in the city's cells in the San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On 25 October, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months of the investigation, he had gathered enough evidence to prove Jonas's guilt. The evidence includes, for example, the payment of the 1.5 million peso to the casino's representatives in exchange for the promise that the operation would be allowed to be granted.
This Monday, the legal commissioner of Casina Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, approached Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for a pardon for the region's mayor's brother. On that basis, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, the Public Ministry's representative assigned to that court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gómez whether the damage had been corrected and which of the associates had decided to pardon him. However, the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain classified.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is being given to Jonas Larrazábal. It will not be possible to file a complaint in the trial conducted against him. It is also not possible to claim compensation for damages or punishment.
After a trial with the legal commissioner at about 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazal Bretón.
The court secretary, Jorge Yanéz, appeared at the prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and his case was dropped in the archives.
He also told him that the judge had issued an immediate ordinance for his release.
The secretary, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, presented details about the air accident that killed the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven other people.
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (SCT) reported that the results of the accident investigation, which killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, show that the helicopter landed directly on the terrain with full force, without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the plane took off, the pilot stated that the climatic conditions allowed the flight.
"The number that appears suggests that the unit came in contact with the terrain several times, the wings became entangled in tree branches 25 metres from where the unit lost its hull."
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for transporting the staff.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground based on the investigation conducted in the impact area.
"In the search, it was discovered that parts of the aircraft were not in a different place, so the plane crashed to the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 people, meeting all the requirements for the transport of people.
The terrain shows a slope with a gradient of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment the most important thing is to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation could take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director general of airports and ancillary services, said that at the moment of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft upward terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a routine overfly operation at the time of the accident," he said.
At a press conference, a representative of the SCT Pérez Já Rect named the six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was conducted according to the rules of the visual flight, meaning the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate conditions at takeoff, in accordance with the aircraft moving towards the border, between the DF and the state of Mexico were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is probably that, because of the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and more visibility to the Cuernavaca valley.
Position of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the helicopter's last recording from the radar coincide, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the trajectory of the flight before the impact.
Distracting the remains of the aircraft in a restricted area:
The information we currently have at our disposal allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The draw of the dispersal of the remains of the plane indicates that the helicopter was complete at the time of the crash on land.
There was no fire or explosion.
No evidence was recorded at the crash site indicating that there had been an explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain slopes, the pitch goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage in which there was probably a disintegration along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to suggest that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several places.
A careful search around the accident, in a territory that is more extensive than the area of the set-kol. the remains of the helicopter were not found, reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still complete.
Mexico's health insurance institute launches research into the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents. It implements the research with the support of experts from the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to detect the obesity gene in children and young people. Research called "Abre Obesity Genetics in Children and Teenagers" will allow for results to be obtained on overweight.
In a report by the head of the Biochemistry Research Medical Unit from the Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century National Health Center, Miguel Cruz López, he explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team relies on the support of specialists and students of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, or has no authorization or not authorized, can also participate in the research. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where tests for minors will be performed each Saturday from 8 a.m.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexican State) and from 8 October this activity was also carried out at the Unenualsóyyolt Sports Centre (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelosus Sports Centre (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research was to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity and to trace to Mexican children and young people risk factors and thus prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim was to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the age of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and a family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause disease such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He specified that every Saturday, all participants are being made of anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglicerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined and genes are studied (the genes involved in the development of childhood obesity are being used to identify).
Cruz López said that this research reflected the concern of health professionals over the alarming increase in child's weight.
'Health polls conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was an increase in obesity of 77% for boys and 47% for girls. There was also a dramatic increase in overweight', said the IMSS expert.
He said that one of the reasons for the search for indicators was the assumption that the country's population was different from that of other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic make-up, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in the genes responsible for the emergence of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as an inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits of the participants were to receive an overall assessment of the condition of the children, to determine whether they exhibit any known overweight or obesity.
He said that even the presence of dark-coloured wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-curkrovical conditions.
The information is confidential so far, with doctors handing it in writing to their parents and explaining to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they have to make to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three major ingredients that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle to reduce daily physical activity, sit around in front of the TV, and use means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Overweight is also due to a large caloric intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fats and proteins, and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
In Asphalt from UNAM there will be no potholes
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty of UNAM, creates modified asphalts with polymers to create a mixture with better functionality, independently of the climatic conditions and the temperature
If the cobbles were properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 potholes after each rainy season in the Metropolitan area of the Valle de México, Rafael Herrera pointed out to UNAM, a chemical faculty scientist at the Faculty of Chem (FQ), who also added that if the design and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, there would be a significant reduction in potholes, or even be able to remove them completely.
In his lecture, the Technology Cause of Bource of Bource, he announced as part of the International Year of Chemistry that the laboratory under his leadership was developing modified asphalts with polymers, creating a mixture with similar characteristics to the asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájer believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with an extremely warm climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, improving functionality and reducing the creation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of the oil, is a cluster of hydrocarbon molecules, molecular-weight molecules called asphaltes, and others with low molecular weights called mortons. Together, they give the asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoleastic character of the asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it acts like a liquid, with a high viscosity at 120 degrees and is almost in firm state at 50 degrees, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to be broken, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, the chemical engineering expert pointed out.
A scientist at the Chemistry School observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with flexible paving, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers are the asphalt insert, made up of small stones topped in the asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that makes up the insert is topped with asphalt.
When passing through cars or when you create pressure, it is so possible to disinhumst the forces in the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be better distributed, the chemical engineer believes.
He added that the asphalt insert was the last layer called the cloak, made up of fine stone, i.e. sand also bathed in asphalt.
As this layer will come into contact with the vehicle rims, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and ensure friction of the road.
As part of the cobbles, the cladding will be subjected to heavy loads, the casing must be of sufficient thickness and care must be of the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to be remembered. Water in particular has a big impact on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is damp, the water travels inwards and it is difficult to get out, this causes all layers of pavement to be softened and thus the formation of potholes.
He explained that the film of the cladding is the first to be damaged during the potholes and only then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, the damage is not done at one point, but it is a gradual process that should stop at the first signs using the appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National Scientists' System, he also explained that the load on vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each single layer of paving must be commensurate with the load of vehicles and it must be guaranteed that this burden will not be exceeded. This is the only way that we can prevent the frequent emergence of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there is still a lot of work to do when it comes to asphalt, and the research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and make it easy to repair potholes without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not win the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle wins the 14th title of the first multi-iss.
Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to find herself on the podium of the winner, winning a silver crown and a sasha, on the basis of which she became the new first multi-isses of Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which she won and took the scepter on Miss Atlántico, the aforementioned department received the 14th title of the first multi-iss. Melina thus joined the crowds of women from the Valle del Cauca, who came within reach of the winning crown, but were eventually announced by the first more-caseiss. These include Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1983), the Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga
The question that many are asking. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favourite, who showed in all previous rounds that she has the ups and downs to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for nothing has she become the Queen of the Police and the Faking Faces of the Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by the likes of Talian Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury decided to name it only The First Multiss is the fact that it did not convince with its answer to the question: "Which book did you like best and why?", which was written by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Literary Editor Leamos.
When asked, the candidate replied:
"I've very much. I very much believe in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of cultivation. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was "Little Prince," a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Penal's Punishment". It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer did not appeal both because of the term "culturalise" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the various books mentioned had been to her.
After the ceremony was over, Melina said she was at peace and pleased with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen is to happen.
And you people, read, if you can. The little prince is a wonderful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle has destroyed the position of the favourite.
The Bogoth journalist suggested that the candidate's favourite, most celebrated from the start, the one that had won all the previous awards (the Oster's Astronomical Challenge, the Public title for Best Artistic Clothes and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of the other contenders, stressed out the Queen, who then fled on the scene.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuit at the Hilton beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she was glowing on both of them, it was evident that she lacked the strength and fervor shown by the representatives from Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Late Home" program at the Canal RCN, believes that Melinda's first multi-dog title is confirmed by the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles in the end does not leave with the Queen's crown during the competition."
Moreover, Valle has held a rather unkind attitude towards the media in recent days, and that has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of its interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just on the sidelines, two days before the election, international jurywoman Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of her country's social needs.
"In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty alone is not enough, you need to see even more than just physical beauty. You need to focus on social feeling. It is important that the candidates are involved in such projects before entering the competition," she explained.
There is also speculation that the candidate, Valle, has lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis that was evident in the bottom. But this is completely contradicting the jury's verdict, which chose miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, the right nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the queens, acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but the fibrosis problems on the bottom, which I don't think were very noticeable, took away her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes the Walla native made the mistake of undergoing several surgical procedures.
'The surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't work out in Valle.
The body was never her forte, and here she took its toll."
For this award, which was first given by the National Assembly of Beauty, there was a cruel prediction after the swimsuit show that came to fruition. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo had indulged in Melina so that he would not have to award her the highest crown in the end.
Whether it's true or not, what is certain is that this day Melina has started her reign for reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition herself.
However, he will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the riveting success in Cartagena, did not make it to the highest crown.
Such was the work of a Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfons Cano
The fingerprints expert from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonsa Cana."
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4 of last year, the CTI fingerprints expert in Cali entered history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader Farc: "Alfonles Cana," by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprints of the CTI department, this week's turn was for Eliazar González, a man from Puert Tejad who has worked in court-research for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked at the town hall in Chocó, where he often had to make his way through the forest for more than five days to get to the place where the corpses had to be identified.
He moved to the capital, Valle, in 2000, and after completing the courses in question, began to specialize in fingerprints. This science is engaged in the study of skin friction, i.e. the hands and feet' hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against the aforementioned Alfonso Cana, they told Eliazar to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he set off for Cauco in a helicopter from Palmur.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he was suspected of being the man who ran the world's oldest guerilla, so he was asked to take the fingerprint card of Guillerm León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the scene where the corpse was located, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance. He looked quite different from the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed as a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with a galton magnifying glass, ink, and a transplator and a light, Eliazar began comparing the dactyl recordings of the corpse to the card's entries.
The Eyes did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night, the man originally from Puerto Tejad was instructed to confirm to Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón if he was indeed the supreme commander Farc.
Searching for tracks
For the dactyloscophocope of Sijín de Cali, the recognition shown to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference of the operational service against "Can" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our jobs.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of offences.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help to research crimes such as theft or murder and corroborate the identity of the people caught.
When they are caught, a lot of offenders present fake documents or do not have papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator told the investigator that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house's wall in the house, because at this point the thief was leaning on to pull out a vault full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we could get the imprint of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator involved in several thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the case of murder.
Not long ago they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
The investigation revealed that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and the bottle print actually confirmed it.
Although it is not 100% to be confirmed that he was indeed the killer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprints expert explained that the items were "shaded with chemical or physical reactive substances."
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used for their collection.
The prints are then sent to Asif, which is a database of offenders, or to the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data is not recorded anywhere," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television programme.
Like everything that glitches, there's no gold, not everything you touch, there are tracks.
However, if it can be used, the appropriate comparison must be made.
"Increation" protests in New York
Hundreds of manifestoers crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Install Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday as they tried to re-twent Manhattan Square with a court order to get from where they were taken in the morning. Afterwards, they tried to take another New York Park.
Hundreds of manifestants crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get by a court order that allows the "spent in" to return to the site of the tent. The other part of the movement responded to the evasement by taking a park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in a different place and continue the legal battle in order to return to Zuccottti, both through rallies and peaceful rallies," said one of the speakers of the "Set Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray clarified that the "eatured" response to the eviction of the camp, ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, had reached the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forcible eviction and allowing the manifestos to continue to establish themselves here.
In addition, the "eatenery" took over another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and 6a Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and the rectory grounds at Trinity Church.
They managed to take the place for at least an hour, but then the police came and detained some of the manifestants. Bray didn't know the exact number, but said he saw that they had also put the handcuffs on to some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have taken up residence on the spot. A delegation of religious officials also came to express their support and also try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the relocated manifestants even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to members who guarded the plaza, which sparked "some small clashes," said Bray, who condemned the fact that some officers were fraying the manifesto.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement or using " laws that have been published after the take-up has begun, or to prohibit the manifestos from the park with shops or other places they have previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of public space and pointed out to the manifestants that local laws did not allow them to return to the tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and who were approached because the manifestos were "breasted by the law."
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not go to protest but to break the law and in some cases to hurt others," because "some shops received threatening letters" and "the neighbors feared for the quality of their lives."
"The early evasion was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," added a spokesman for the movement, accusing the mayor of "destroying the freedom of expression."
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also said they planned to organize "big events" for Thursday in cooperation with community and trade unions to commemorate the two months after which the protests were going on, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will present the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, she will appear in the television programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant at "Home Improvement," a lifeguard at "Baywatch," bunny in "Playboy," wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show for Canadian television.
CTV's private television station announced today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs, Michael Bublé, and other major Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from online domestic pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, the "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll presenting Santa Claus in a cricket.
As Josef, Peters, a well-known Canadian Indian-born comedian who recently served as a presenter on the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, Charlie Sheen, will appear on the scene.
Cons Anderson and Peters will appear on a special CTV Christmas broadcast by Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian a "famish" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan returns to life after devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending the fall period that began in March
Since March of last year, Japan's economy has been paralysed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The first estimates of the dossier's government have put material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that heals well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of falls, the value of GDP between July and September has taken the value of GDP to such a definitive reversal of the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% a year.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - the tax year for the Japanese starts in March 2012 - anticipate the highest growth rate in comparison with the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of the machines that are necessary to rebuild areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses have increased their investment by 1.1%, spending will fall by 0.9% compared to the January-March period. This is the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse, which forces us to use the crisis to emerge from it to strengthen or to rebuild the infrastructures. It is a matter of using the shortage to start from scratch.
Japan has awoken, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
The flows were put in the hands of the internal market when yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone's debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege that is also a heavy burden on export companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of the major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak results in July to the yen course in September.
While markets continue to be besieged by EU peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government is cautious.
"We must look out for the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," said State Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
Indeed, the perspectives are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) clarified that most member countries showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing.
It dropped four-tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even come below the average at 100. It has reached the level of 99.3.13 points.
Athens spreads uncertainty again
Papadimos says austerity will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign a written commitment
With the rapid and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that has reimbeid, Greece is increasingly being involved in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the great debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the "compreement" of the new transitional Greek government is due to the demands of Brussels rather than by the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received on his appointment is likely to be short for their application, the chairman of the Conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, said he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for the new election for the expected date of 19 February.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate in a vote of confidence in the government tomorrow.
The 24 programme package to support employment, the reform of the Disciplinary Code of Officials and the new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message does not clear any doubts about his position: 'We have made a commitment to help the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else'.
The Conservative leader went a little far from the EU and the IMF in his speech, with these organisations unblocking the $8 billion that Athens is in dire need, but he said he would not support and sign any commitment to the austerity measures.
The European Commission, already upset by the impact of the impact caused by the talk of the referendum, stressed yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it does not unlock any assistance if the new government and the leaders of the main parties do not sign a "swings commitment with ambiguity and as soon as possible."
The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors from the Three will return to Athens "very soon" to negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part of the eight billion." But there is no definitive date.
The Greek top-line has a moment to knit.
Queen Sofia: 'There are tools for progress and hope'
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this kind of finance
Spain has "gone a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance."
Queen Sofia yesterday recalled that the country has become the second donor to the planet in the last two decades in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that this is a tool of social progress, justice and the hope for a better future for all of humanity. It is a tool based on trust in man."
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th Global Microloon Microwast Summit in Valladolid with the belief that there is no doubt" that this kind of operations is "totally necessary" to reach the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015. "This is particularly about achieving goals to achieve a reduction of half the number of people who live with less than one dollars per day, the amount that sets the poverty threshold."
Spain will "stunt to continue to work" and expand a network of volunteers "in all the corners of the planet and take this task responsibly," stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the Summre's initiatives and benefits, which will last until Thursday, "ensure to create better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" to whom these loans are intended in the first place.
"We have already reached much" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The Micro-Lent Summit is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support "basic objectives."
Her Majesty explained that the aim was for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to be above the poverty threshold they currently live under.
The concept of micro-loanes spread to Spain and other countries of the world after "what the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus, has embarked on this journey," the Queen said, adding that this was "an act of justice and the necessary recognition."
She described the father of this instrument as "an admirable idealist who embarked on a path of fighting poverty." She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted with his policy of loans.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "At all these meetings, I could find constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned her the title of "head of the family" awarded to her in Valladolid yesterday by the "movement of the poor."
Queen Sofia concluded her performance by urging participants to engage in discussions and the search for solutions, thus allowing the fight to combat poverty to continue.
"Ethical imperative"
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the balobytes, as this cooperation is a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez believes that microloanes represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty," and now, more than ever, the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and not allow solidarity to be the victims of cuts.
For Spain, the micro-loan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, has welcomed the success of the concept that we will give confidence to the people who are being locked by all the others' doors. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city that "open its gates with a spirit of solidarity that is contagious."
CDU proposes to vote for European president on the basis of universal suffrage
Without serious trouble for the chancellor and Christian Democratic Party leader Angela Merkel, the first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress took place in Leipzig on Monday, November 14.
The question of Europe's future was not originally on the agenda, but it did not happen until the autumn, especially to be satisfied by party members who view the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians as lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission under leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 abstentions.
A few minutes of standing up at the end of Angela Merkel's remarks, and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: the response to the crisis is 'not less of Europe, but more of Europe'.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
According to the chancellor, the time of change has "fade" in Europe.
This could be expressed in the amendments to the Lisbon Treaty, which will make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area members, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage by the aim of giving Europe one face."
Such, in any case, is one of the ideas of the draft adopted by the Congress, the inspiration of which is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the UK is opposed, and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will also take the same stance.
But the direction is being set out.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to value each country's weight on the board of directors of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will evidently result in Germany's weight enhancement.
Led by the concern to calm the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not try to win a congress through talk of "small" European states or states in difficulty, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Though the proposal for Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of the "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes disability fraud?
After the aids, the UMP and the government are launching an offensive against work-related incapacitated.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will make a speech on the subject of a recurring debate since 2007 on the fight against social fraud and redistribution of solidarity.
As an escort of this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased severity but is no less clear from the perspective of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on disability.
First, because of the budget savings, the government intends to impose on private sector workers on the fourth day of incapacity for work before they start taking sick leave.
Clearly speaking, without the approval of the business, an employee who gets sick would lose four days' wages, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing much of the bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in €280 million.
And a measure that would be accompanied by another symbolic reach measure: to give civil servants one day of unpaunched sick leave (until yet they have no incapacity to default compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the right-wing majority also launch a fraud-focused themat directed this time on the angants tied to work incompetence.
"The check will be much more extensive, and furthermore: if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand pointed out during an interview given to RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear somewhat disproportionate to the truth of indoes not-ority.
These have in fact been the subject of constant surveillance since 2002 and of the political onslaught that bore fruit.
The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's first stop at a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM - state health insurance company), more than 237 million euro euros of daily compensation was paid out in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health, in 2008 daily compensation with its 11.3 billion euros was 5% of health-care spending.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity and accidents at work, and 54% related to incapacity for work, or 6.2 billion euros.
That is, only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting group, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010, compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that hides some variations: another poll published in 2007 on the Monster.com work opportunities website showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not chosen any sick leave.
Another study, this time carried out by the institution of sickness insurance, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of work incapacitation was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months and 11% took longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French employees are no longer prone to work-incapacity other than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Center) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
The cheating on work incapacitations represents only a small part of it compared to black-market work.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only small in scale.
Strengthening the legislation since 2002 has caused systematic checks to be carried out on incapacity for work of more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM noted that with 1.5 million inspections, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out because of the short-term inability of "unjust or too long," or 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incompetence for more than 45 days, 11% of the "inadaptable or unauthorized" cases were counted to 1.2 million inspections, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169,000 "unlawful" cases to several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents far less than a figure expressing black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tiano, the author of the June report on the issue, this figure would be 9 to 15 billion euros missing for tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece to have to apply new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to resume its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos made the words before the parliament, adding that the hundred days given to his government of unity would not be enough to complete the task.
"To get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget rescue plan," the head of the Government said as he made his first public address on Wednesday at the opening of the debate to vote of confidence in parliament.
The application of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 will be the new government's "main-hit" as our country's participation in the euro area is in play, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos projected that the country's public deficit would be "currude 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Actions
The leader of the right, Antonis Samaras, voiced his support for an already-approved measure on Monday to try to escape the debt crisis, but cautioned that his party is not taking any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with his New Democracy party MPs.
We have agreed to targets to reduce the deficit and debt and fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would hinden the economic recovery.
To Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for the Economy and the Manuet, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee from all the parties to support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under the external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide need to be legalized, says expert commission
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians are being denied death.
In the matter of the Palliative Care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best, a poliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society is living the idea of denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians do accept the ability to talk to the doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take a decision in that sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report of the Royal Canadian Society, in which six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, were involved.
This commission recommends that the Government change the criminal right to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if that choice appears to be necessary for a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent poll by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Though Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that"medicalization of death in Canada gave rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death."
Medics to do or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to Palliative Care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite their desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
This average is true for the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this is the highest with 86% of those who died in hospital.
As for the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that she does not want to change anything about criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also inspected all countries where these approaches are legalised or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that such criminalisation is caused by any misuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons not competent or disapproval.
In contrast, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, the report's co-author, confirmed more than numerous instances of these missteps in teleconference yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that, according to an investigation conducted by the Angus Reid Forum in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already spoken in favour of euthanasia because they believe it will allow those at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we are sending out a message about the life of old or handicapped people being worth less.
As for those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of the people surveyed think they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear in the matter of maintaining or interrupting patient care, say the authors of the report.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that it should be stated in criminal law that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The expert's commission also requires specialist doctors to be trained to be required to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their lives without fearing a prosecution.
In the matter of the Palliative Care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to provide the best, a poliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, in the matter of the paliational or final mitigation already widely used in the Canadian health facilities, the commission requires that it be considered euthanasia when it is no longer used to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reserving other experts
Some medical law experts have already voiced their reservations about the findings of the Royal Canadian Society's experts' report.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of expert-signatarians of the report as "extreme", among other things, because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the sufferers in the final stages.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is more than 18 years old could request to help commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the résumé news yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it looks as if the authors of the report are putting the autonomy of the person above all the other values that shape the social fabric of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a ""manifesto for euthanasia."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts in particular the reports on the absence of misconduct in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls for President Assad to Resign
Damascus talks about "complote"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's followers rallied in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria intensified against President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, resists them and talks about "command" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership of the Arab League, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, the country bordering Syria, took a stand in favor of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was yesterday the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed," he said.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for the new phase of Syria's political life," the king of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his party, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, regretted that the efforts made by the Turkish mediation on the Syrian regime to the company had not been crowned with success since the start of the year.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, alluding to neighboring Syria, to which Turkey is applying an increasingly harsher line.
The United States rejoiced at the "supon of the consensus against Assad and the dishonest actions of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"International Community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are applying an increasingly harsher tone" against the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As announced by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces died in the city of Deraa in the south of Syria.
According to this NGO, two other civilian persons were killed in shootings and concentrated shooting from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
After all, however, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was "leascending on the way out of the crisis."
Indeed, he also reacted vividly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which he believes is a "dangerous move."
Syria"does not bow to it,"he added with the assurance that "Complots swam against Syria will not succeed."
Following his decision to suspend Syria, the Arab States' League of Civil Protection Mechanism is currently undergivens to the Arab League" and plans to send 500 human rights, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favorably in favor of the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he believes is "paranoidid."
A new special meeting of the League is convened for tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the plan to resolve the crisis, decided on 2 December, in particular to be expected to be the withdrawal of armies from cities plagued by the outrages and the liberation of imprisoned manifestoers.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov considered the League's decision to be "wrong" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but in doing so, to avoid fully promoting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time and victims after Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to shape his team and start implementing a program that includes"victs" in order to regain credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's government.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties before meeting with trade union and employers' representatives today.
It should form a relatively slender cabinet made up of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the designated Prime Minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask the parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti's introduction of a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti yesterday commented on the jitters in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In the "democracy, the exact terms apply" to the preparation of the government and its agenda, he stressed, adding that it is "sure that the markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment as president was favourably received at the outposts by the markets at first, but concern reappeared after the eurozone's unexpected industrial production slump in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should form a team involving mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept"politics."
He expressed confidence that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next election.
According to Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini the new government will receive the confidence of the parliament until Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency and with the aim of making Italy a strong link" to be Europe'
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "i with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in 2013 and is calling for new tough measures.
Confindustria, the head of the Confindustria business union, Emma Marcegaglia, who will meet with the Ass-Twitz on Tuesday, has focused on the need to revive the economy" as a country that does not show growth cannot adhere to deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004), recognized for his expertise and independence,"profesor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorial, a call for seriousness" and "jina Italy," represents for Italy "epochal change" after 17 years of "berlusconism."
The great unknown will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to avoid an early election, as Italy must place 200 billion euro in government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator usable for the atomic weapon, an American NGO specialized in atomic risks announced on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked by the United Nations Agency in the identification of the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA gave its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute, widely drawn from the IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should work for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds using the blast method.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the resort to set up a "nano-diamint" business in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties were supposed to lead him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was then to work together from 1996 to 2002 on the Iranian programme.
In its latest IAEA report, it recalls "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member state informed the agency about it - worked during a substantial part of his working career on this technology under the country's military nuclear program from where he comes from."
Anti-Muslim criminal acts and offences up by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of criminal acts and offences targeting Muslims rose by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence fell slightly or slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160, i.e. a 49% increase over the procedure of 13% for violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% for offences against Jews and an overall increase of 14% for anti-religious criminal offences and offenses.
The total number of "hateless criminal acts" risen very slightly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and the offenses rise again," Human Rights First emphasized the human rights organization," the growth of anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in its communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be seen as a serious violation of a person's rights," adds one of the organization's leaders, Paul Legendre.
"The US government can and must do more to deal with these evils," he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reports of "hateful criminal acts."
The "hate criminal act" in American federal law is a legion of the age of the fight for civil rights.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and resembling more Facebook
The Twitter microblogging service site's site was introduced on Monday by design changes to enable its users to observe the activities of the successors, which somewhat likens to its Facebook services.
New Offers"" and"name" make it possible to better and directly know the activities of other people who are following you or those whose answers ("tweets") are being watched by you.
This allows you to know if they allow you to track posts, whether they sign up for new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
Twitter's new face was tested"in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little-imfremeable work, with the rather unintelligible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des called a initiés, s'ouvre ainsi and un public and un public plus avec un maniement plus a comparable celi des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" judge the significance of this innovation differently.
"It's pointless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"Function Action will help me to follow some of the elements of my Twitter," he sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
the inclusion of the golden rule on a balanced budget in the constitution
The government of the grand coalition of the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write the "golden rule" of the budget policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction in Austrian ratings by credit rating agencies (AAA).
It was the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting in a situation where the Austrian public debt, with its 74.6%, is well above the criterion of a maximum of 60% laid down by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had been reduced by just one notch of a single degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euro more in interest each year," argued the Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister, the baptismal democrat Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following a request for a summit of euro area countries in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where heads of state and government strongly requested that by the end of 2012, a reduction in the public deficit and the balance of public accounts be entered into the constitution or a law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model," Germany being the first European country to accept such a "rule."
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty in the horizon of 2020/21.
Strong only
Noda threatens to intervene in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Nod warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in the foreign exchange markets if he were to just continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene as we did for the last time if we find too much volatile" in the yen's exchange rate, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to the historical values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had only recently broken the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only then has he regularly risen supported by purchases by investors who see him as a "safe harbour" in the uncertain days of the world economic slowdown and the European crisis caused by debt.
The dollar came under 77 yen again on Tuesday, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This outburst of the Japanese currency is detrimental to island exports, as it makes the price of Made in Japan's products more expensive and reduces the value of the proceeds generated by Japanese firms from abroad when they are transferred to the domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and the tsunami that devastated the region of Tohoku in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this hike to the yen will not yet kill the fragile revival in the egg.
The world's third economic power resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% relative to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year thanks to a survey of growth in exports and consumption of households burdened by disaster.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan."
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's multi-governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, pointed out that the BoJ had previously adopted "drong measures" suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Emissions Institute increased by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion) of its purchases of Treasury bills and increased to 55,000 billion only (€519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts he devotes to purchases of various securities to flood with liquidation.
Eurozone:
rates rise, stock markets fail
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis is still being undermined by European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European stock markets still concerned about the stability of the euro area are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 is down 1.4% at 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With new tension about the revenues from the loans of the euro area states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to yield only a portion of recent gains."
"Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, a broker with IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo exchange rate was closing with a 0.70% drop, which it suffered due to concerns from market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the shift will only continue in the narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized," estimates MitsušigeA Akino, the fund manager at Iiyoshis Investment Management.
This relaunch of uncertainties over the future of the euro area is hurting the currency itself, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is reaching its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is worth $1.3570 as it retreats by 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency backtracked after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU's CDU's party at its congress on Monday adopted a proposal to exit the eurozone for countries in trouble without therefore having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the 6% threshold
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, on Tuesday morning, the Italian 10-year bond yields is 6.85%, and the return on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions at the interest rates of the southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded time in the markets to remedy the situation in Italy at risk of poisoning caused by its debt.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "head-taking" of his government.
Spain is once again in a deliberate line of markets when the House of Commons elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between Germany's 10-year and Spanish bonds has reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of euro area growth numbers
The statistical figures say that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter mainly due to household consumption, i.e. a little better than the expected growth of 0.3%.
Nevertheless, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised the second-quarter figures to a 0.1% drop in GDP instead of stagnation.
And, in truth, it's the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
From its side, Germany registered growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just raised the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must conquer dogma
If there is a theme that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotion, then it is an energy policy.
The flexibility and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is only natural for a meeting at the election to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that is occupied by the energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful when all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will spark a duplication of electricity demand from now until 2050 if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world's population of important parts of life.
At the same time, a shortage of fossil resources will need to be faced to continue to be generated, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a subject that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident affects none of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear power.
But this is not the case for Belgium, which subordinates its decision to the need to find some other resource capable of replacing itself, nor by Switzerland, which it considers it right to build only the last-generation power plants.
Conversely, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
The United States decided to expand its park with one unit after Fukushima by the resumption of the construction of one power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts this.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the price of electricity rallies, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, the sharp rise in CO2 emissions generated by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All of these unpleasant effects will be felt in a matter of months.
The case of Denmark desises us to think about it.
The European Wind Plant Champion, from which it takes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas because of the irregularity of the wind, which makes CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices 65% higher, or 50%, respectively.
Conversely, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an invoice for electricity 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry in the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, making illusory beautiful declarations of re-industrialisation of our country and defending purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of French people refuses to pay, just as it is fundamentally opposed to this energy, as the opinion polls show.
Recall that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 downstream jobs.
The highly exporting sector is dragging a large number of small and medium-sized specialist firms creating jobs to international markets, which cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose the 6 billion euro a year the country receives for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
What power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to operate for 60 years while the bankruptcy of its manufacturer was planned?
When dealing with the energy equation, it must be accepted that there is no magical source for energy production, or even that there is no diabolical one.
The development of low-CO2 emission installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industrial group AREVA attest to the complementarity of the energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which conducts uncompromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionalism is recognised have the idea of safety in their blood.
Fifty years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred under normal operation conditions and remained free of human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by the design of the reactor and inexcusable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, it appears that some forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this crash just as it did for the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and designers is that the EPR-type reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomek.
While all those interested in hating a nuclear power plant consider it to be stopped by its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to rival AREVA and EDF's competitors and a way to seize a leading position in nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from different angles - the overloatting of the police, the courts and the administration subjected to the calculus policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights" boasts to France.
Recently, it was an administrative harassment of which was foreign students, which became topical when the Minister of the Interior (see the newspaper Libération on May 23) said that France "doesn't need foreign talents, bricklayers and waitresses."
But so far it has rarely been dismantled at an economic angle.
It must be said that there is a rather wide consensus between the left and the right in this area.
To the right tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac set out with his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and on the left Michel Rocard when he said in 1990 that France "can't accept all the misery of the world."
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invading the hordes of Polish plumbers to the French territory was shared on the right and the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity we are to compensate for immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banality when he states that joint developments will make it possible to solve our "migration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem is perhaps true in elections, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp):
Restricting immigration crippling growth and harms employment.
Fears of the effects of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and put pressure on lowering their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complemented than replacements for French employees by doing work in sectors with a shortage of staff.
Not qualified immigrants in sectors that attract French staff, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which education is not enough to offer places.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthesiologists, these additions between the French and the migrants make immigrant arrivals a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would trigger a long-term increase in real wages between between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And yet he does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributed to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay, and Yahoo have been set up by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries at an average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, one immigrant arrifs up at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) to public budgets in its entire lives.
Nicolas Sarkozy made a wish at the start of his mandate to go for the missing percentages of growth"with bared teeth."
The teeth in question to deter the immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe inventes democracy, to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and also very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for even though he invented it in Athens two thousand years ago, he experienced the tragedies of the world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franca in Spain, Salazara in Portugal and the colonels in Greece, during the XXth century.
Some people could believe that in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to make choices and implement it in the most direct way possible.
But it is known from Napoleon that it was an easyness of thought.
General suffrage, though a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition, and may become a "sicle of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been just as it has been since the start of the crises of politics and democracy.
The admission of a mistake by a Greek referendum yes-no will have the value of a double revelation in this regard: revelations of the need for a great return of political power, but also to reveal a disturbing sense of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have relocated today, and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we demand a series of national referendums held according to necessity and disorganised.
Bianko, on display to the European absolutist monarch or a jump with his feet tied to the emptiness of the nationalist depths: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want knives of guillotines, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous performance of selection and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop the list - for the crisis is in Europe.
For it is the whole of Europe, bingel in front of the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffer from its incompetence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are disturbing ourselves in the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
There is an urgent need to return the governance of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, to get rid of the rule of markets and to prepare the future by investing.
The east of the crisis will envisage decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, or it would lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now strongly demanding a European economic government.
So be it.
But to think this without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by the citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We need to take on a new phase of European construction.
To form a republic in France, it was necessary to "fake" the Republicans.
A revolution in interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This will only be done by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become European to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Trade Books Fair will open in Villepinte near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase in world sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM card phones) to more than 6 billion units.
The most supporting segment is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay for mass transit or take purchases by simply bringing the card closer to the reader.
This year should be sold 460 million chips cards worldwide against the 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise even further in 2012 (alleveed 580 million units) and reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Having long been in the grip of the APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals are receiving them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been issued.
But the big retail chains are working for two.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million MasterCard contactless cards this year.
To put a higher gear on gear, the banks need to equip their clients with them from now on.
"Trays of France have committed to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their clients in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test paying by mobile
But this is only the first stage on the means of payment of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to conduct transactions today is only a small number of devices equipped with.
"They're late."
"But their real boom should take place next year."
"For 2012, we estimate their sale in the world to be 80 to 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Yesterday, Crédit agricole announced the launch of a test conducted in Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 clients and associates will be equipped with a case permitting contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
Also, Société générale announced yesterday that it was preparing to introduce an offer to allow its clients to pay with a mobile phone without a phone.
Terrorist Front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the al-Qaeda ties in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-term suspicions that there are al-occupies of the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Niger sect Boko Haram are being confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algiers had now" made sure of it."
"The way in which both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he explained without elaborating.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the abduction of two French people in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by members of AQMI from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their hijackers in an operation performed by special French troops.
In the rubble after the hit, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the calls carried out leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two figures: one leads to a Nigerian who has been at length in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and a sect.
"This is progress, but no doubt we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about the operational co-operation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have been in the longest time that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is manifesting itself more and more actively," the Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo tempers the remarks are tempering.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more obvious in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which from now on include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same mode of execution as those used by the AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the challenges posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Quick Success
The Boko Haram Sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "Western education is a sin" he approves of the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a merger has been a quick success.
The sect is politicizing and requiring strict upholding of Islamic sharia law, while its followers begin the fight against the 'central government.
These people first target churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government's response is still the same.
The army will obcreine the city and the result is 800 dead.
The sect's founder, Mohammed Yusuf, is caught and killed in prison.
From that moment on, the group is radicalized and leaves its post in the north.
At Christmas 2010, he will carry out an assassination in the city of Jos, killing 80 people, then another one in the capital, Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will be attacked by police headquarters in their first suicide attack.
And in August, the U.N. local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa to run from Mauritania via Nigeria to Somalia is now alarmed by all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda has surrounded the Islamic Maghreb by Mali and ighers and Al-Sabab militants are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
In Nigeria last week, speaking with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé, said that France was on alert and ready to "take all the information."
The world according to the presidential candidates
On issues relating to China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are both in a breeziness and a breeziness.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listing the presidential candidates, voters might think that.
For days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating loudlomighting statements and brief tutorias on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or aid to Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-ranked candidate in the race for the nomination of the Republican"Grand Old Party," threatened Chinese to be by profession before the World Trade Organization and their accusations "to manipulate their currency," a theme in America that is a bear-bearing theme in America by the rasped migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Worse, worse if this must include the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, was almost stung by the attitude that "senses" emotion.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in the last of the electoral finishes, remains in-uspicable.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in a fanfar.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to disappoint his duties toward that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat, because Beijing will "explore nuclear capabilities" - evidently ignorant of the fact that China has owned an atomic weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against the presumed terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far away from what the Republican nominee, John McCain, was in 2008, the heavyweight in foreign policy.
The current president's opponents say Reagan had simple ideas, too, and still won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine on the fight against terrorism.
They highlight the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the halranged departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses about Libya and thus attribute the label of the weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population is judging President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
He has no confidence in the military interventions from Iraq that lead to mired.
And with the argument that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is knocking to a more correct position.
Nord Stream, the new entry port of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance pipeline connecting directly to Eastern Europe to Russia and conducted along the bottom of the Baltic Sea has started to work.
It must deliver gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, among them 4 heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that will connect directly to Russia and Germany under the sea last Tuesday.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned the control around the control valve to the west European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas will begin to flow to Western Europe every year with the first 1,224 km pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Meckleburg-Pomerany.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will allow a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be supplied, a quantity equal to the entire French consumption.
And it is already recalled to be able to build a third pipeline pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge structure has the character of a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany without being run around the country by a third state (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of pushing Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
This was most strongly expressed by Warsaw when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact," citing the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say that this is a topic politically sensitive.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained more certainty of its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe of energy, because the project has created cracks between Europeans from the East and the West.
Russia managed to push through its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich, high-consuming, gas-intensive Western nations, the deposits of which are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us," François Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of this pipeline and demonstrated at what point the big gas contracts of affairs are both political and economic.
This is all explained by the broad smiles of Gazprom's leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The underwater pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete shell to be protected from the moor of naval vessels.
It is at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
In its construction, it was necessary to avoid the minefields from the time of World War II.
"Because of safety, nearly a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase the arrangements for the protection of the fauna and flora.
The pipes themselves are a long metal snake weighing like the 242 Eiffel Tower, which is not interrupted anywhere by the valves or maintenance stations on its entire length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were little lusted to see the Russian state-owned company permanently settling off their coast.
"In the event of a defect, we stop the passage of the gas in less than 1 minute," specifies Jens Müller.
In the event of a leaking, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, after all, the welds were designed to create a leak once every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline is checked from the outside by the ship by an underwater impot with the ship, while the interior of the pipeline is checked by a device circulating inside.
This dheletoupe-shaped device of 1 metre in diameter is inserted into the inside of the pipe and is pushed by the gas.
At the finish line after three days of travel at 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of the metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the need for the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is the 200 bar at the start and the 100 bar at the finish.
To implement this project the forces of five companies joined forces.
Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake, remains the leading position.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream in charge of building and operating the pipeline.
The business is based in the city of Zoug in Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company for five years with a contract that could be renewed all its gas transport capacities.
"Gazprom will have a profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," states Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% by the shareholder and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach €7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez group, the investment costs rose to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be refunded, because only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline is rising from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
The 4.5 metre-high valves form the output gate of gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - designer notebook
The Italian firm Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to reiterates its joy of writing.
It brings the scent of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine noteer is easily discernible to its black rectangular plates and its tarnished white-coloured leaves as if aged in time.
After all, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born back in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decides at that time to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the business, takes up the launch of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old "powering" production technique (shiniming), which is used for example to adjust the surface of the benches.
This type of notebook was greatly appreciated by the writer and traveler.
"Mogleine returned to popularity the old and forgotten subject, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the XX century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a leading person at the brand at Modo Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a long-slanded secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to compile some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the notebook captivates the businessman as well as the student or the professionals.
The image of the Moleskine notebook includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured and open spirit.
The small Italian business, which in its early days had 12 employees, has nearly a hundred today and has had two offices since 2008, one of whom is in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to the bookstore and, through the FNAC store chain, to small boutiques in the middle of the cities, where he was able to promote his identity.
"We have watched the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the turbulent development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently, the brand opened an exhibition" for "Disarch" where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also released new recordings of a leopard-like notebook.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook case ... The brand extends to a variety of carriers.
The success that aroused envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital, today Syntegra Capital, a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of handicapped workers so high?
Around 19% of the handicapped people are looking for work.
Today it opens 15. A week for employing the handicapped.
Despite the voluntaristic public policy established in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people of disabilities is twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to the 9% for the entire population.
Is it daunting?
"No, underlined by Éric Blanchet, the general director of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of the Handicap."
"The years reached in 15 years are remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of unemployed people was not two, but three times higher."
"However, there is still much to do."
It must be said that for the unemployed handicapped people, numerous obstacles to the number of people persist before they start work.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% aver a. a.r.
They are low in qualification: 80% do not have a high school diploma, and of the 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are handicapped.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the handicapped, compared to 38% on average.
In short, the criteria that particularly complicate the return to work and which represent the "core of the problem" are, according to Christian Grapin, the Director General of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses recruit disabilities.
So many when it comes to objective brakes.
What remains is the unsolved, the ways of thinking that are surely evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association found that interviewed managers have a weak level of knowledge about handicapped people" with" an exaggerated notion of persons in a mobile chair and mental or mental shortcomings."
As a result, private businesses with more than 20 employees are still a long way from reaching the target of employing 6% of the handicapped workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known numbers, which date back to 2008, give a flat 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, director-general of Agefiph, the organization charged with collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with this law.
The proof is the number of "flight" fined" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 off-tuned to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euro).
"The 2005 law that increased the contributions created a strong push for businesses, Pierre Blanc explains."
"But this improvement is also demonstrated by genuine awareness, especially in big business."
According to the Labor Ministry, only 59% of businesses with 20 to 49 employees employ handicapped workers, compared with 82% of businesses with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling:"What a Happiness"
Before the French representatives (Bleus) were challenged on Tuesday evening (20h45) by the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We don't go so far as to write that there was a conspisice between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after his striker's angry gesture in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach was uttering words of praise for his player.
"I am very satisfied with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches," it is one and the same, justifying himself."
"I've been in Lille for a year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my mark."
Hazard, spared against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, arrives at the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "gone."
It is impossible to ignore the concept of "radity".
Play against Bleus, which he has been cheering on since the age of 7 and in their victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
All the more so because "it's against Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", it recalls.
"We cruised at once."
"Moan playing against them, that's just a pleasure!"
Good-hearted Leekens recalled even "prise."
"Hoonity" to fight"game - a holiday".
"Crorn" also to state with the quality of the "neighborhoods" that France became a team of very high levels a little more than a year after the trauma in the southern African city of Knysna."
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French to the French...
"Our little Belgians will become big," he underlined.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're healthy hunger."
"You'll realize it for the next games." Including the one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portugal's coach Paulo Bento is opening the draw with great optimism against Bosnia Bosnie (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
Both teams lacked realism on the way there.
"At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. The Portuguese national football team, whose helm he has been to the helm since 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from luck.
One match and one opponent - Bosnia - to play.
Conscious of Friday's result (0-0) in the inferno of Zenica, Bosnian, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had the edge for more than an hour, but they were unable to score such a rare goal to relieve it.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk in itself because we didn't score outside."
But at home at their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to advance in front of the audience, who should create a boiling cauldron there, even if the match certainly appears to be" very even," says the optimist, but the thoughtful Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are quite convinced that we can have the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being Euro 2012," the successor to Carlos Queiroz nevertheless relativized.
The tie Friday's game in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A tie may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
"It's a good result, which nevertheless contains a risk because we didn't score a goal out there," regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and which has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start to" give them no time to think about."
A good thought, on the condition that this time it becomes realistic.
