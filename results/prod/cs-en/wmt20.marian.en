An unusually open and unique painting by Karel Gott in the feature-length documentary film by Olga Špátová
This unique film feat from Olga Špátová's workshop will premiere in Czech cinemas next spring.
"In the middle of September last year I received a call from Ivanka and Karel Gott, and they asked me to make a documentary about his life with Karl again after ten years. I did not hesitate to do a minute! I made a filming with a man who lasted more than half a century in the limelight of Czech culture thanks to his exceptional singing talent, artistic humility and immeasurable diligence, was and is a great honour for me. A challenge to make a feature-length documentary film about Karel Gott, which brings the joy of three generations of listeners to his arts, I accepted as a commitment to this legendary singer," she describes her feelings.
The first shooting day was thus already taken on 22 October last year thanks to a quick agreement and agreement, and the last footage with Karel Gott was filmed a few days ago. The goal was and is absolutely clear - to capture authentically Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who is handing out to his supporters, as a painter, but also a loving husband and father of his children. A man who, for sixty years, gives joy to several generations, not only in our country, but also in Europe, and indeed all over the world. A man who has entered into the hearts and souls of his listeners by simply being.
The film is not intended to be a parade of incalonsible glory in Karel Gott and his achievements. "Therefore, it is not even possible to compare my previous film, The Phenoon Gott with this present one. At least by filming them in a different stage of life of Karel Gott, and this will be very apparent in his personal, even intimate confession he has provided to us, which has confirmed to all of us in what legend we have to work and spend time with, which is truly indescribable," adds Olga Špátová.
The creators captured Karel Gott during his performances, in meetings with his fans in the Czech Republic and in Hamburg, but especially in his home environment, whether in Prague, at a cottage in Czech Switzerland, in the village where he spent his childhood, and in other places that played an important role in his life. The film will thus be completely authentic and unique thanks to the sincere openness of Karel Gott.
"Olga has a great gift for filming with his narrow team so that we often got carried away by the spontaneous atmosphere and naturally let it into our privacy, which made me talk about topics of relatively intimate. With my husband, the cameraman Jan Malír, they actually became part of our family. We originally wanted to present the film in 2019, when I celebrated my life's jubilee. But because I had a wonderful summer with my family, I wanted to shoot for as long as possible to film for as long as possible. Well, and since I was everywhere in 2019, I was originally wanted to be released to cinemas in the spring of the year.
Insects are up to 60 times less than 40 years ago
No other animal class is more represented in nature than insects. Brouch, butterflies and other species make up more than half of life on Earth. But there are more reports that the insect empire is radically shrinking. Another scientific study on the subject came out just this week, and the situation is even more serious than humanity has realized so far.
The study is based on field research in the tropical forest of Puerto Rico, in which American scientists copied a similar survey from 1976. As the report is written at the outset, the insects are now "ten to 60 times less" in the forest. It is a decline in the entire population, i.e. not the number of species, while the research was about not only in the insects but of all the arthropods. Due to the extinction of insects, the population of other fauna, which is addicted to the food chain of insects, such as birds, frogs or lizards, are also dwindling.
The authors of the research are putting their conclusions directly in the context of climate change. The average air temperature in the forest has risen by two degrees Celsius over the past thirty years, and warming has become the driving force behind the breakdown of the food chain. The study thus shows, according to the author's team, that the impact of climate change on tropical ecosystems may be much larger than previously assumed.
A major article in the Washington Post published about the report on Monday, which gives the new findings in the headline as hyperalmising. "It's one of the most disturbing articles I've ever read," entomologist David Wagner of the University of Connecticut, who is quoted as an independent expert, told the paper.
The extinction of insects also applies to Europe. "For us, the decline is also the order of magnitude," points out Lukáš Čížek of the Entomological Institute of the Academy of Sciences. According to him, however, it is necessary to take into account the changes of the landscape, which play an essential role in Europe. "For us, they are running for a significantly longer period of time than on Puerto Rico," Čížek adds, explaining why in the forest compared to the 1970s, the scientists could have measured such a rapid decline.
Czechs in Europe Ondřej Houska: Should Czechoslovakia have rejected the Munich Agreement in 1938 and go to war with Germany? Three times NO
The unathed picture depicts Adolf Hitler's visit to the Czechoslovak border fortification. The task of the forts was never to stop the German army, but to slow down its advance before it was involved with the Allies.
If, almost exactly 81 years ago, Czechoslovakia had rejected the Munich Agreement and subsequently faced a German attack, what would take the most Czechoslovak soldiers out of the fight? German tanks, an air force, or perhaps artillery? It might not be either of these weapons, even though the Germans had an overwhelming advantage over the Czechoslovaks. The Czechoslovak army would probably suffer the most losses − due to blisters.
Police union president Stepanek resigned, wants to live as a free man
The chairman of the Independent Police Union of the Independent Police Association, Milan Štěpánek, decided to leave his post. This was reported by Czech Radio - Radiožurnál on Friday. He has led the union's union chairman for two more months. He will remain with the police after leaving the head of the union.
"I can confirm that I have handed over to the Bureau this week my written resignation, after which I will continue to serve full for two months," Štěpánek told Radiožurnálu. "I decided to be a free person who does not want to be bound forever to the trade union. And who wants to live a more peaceful life," he said.
The Independent Trade Union of the Police of the Czech Republic brings together members and employees of the security forces or employees of the Ministry of the Interior. Among other things, the Union participated in police protests against budget cuts or petitions on better terms for the security forces. For example, he also got into a dispute with the then Interior Minister Radek John in 2011 and organized a petition for his resignation. The leadership of the ruling coalition later agreed to John's departure.
Museum in Semily returns to the Velvet Revolution with the exhibition
The imitation of a normalization room with a television, in which footage of the brutal police intervention of police officers against students on 17 November 1989 in Prague. This is also at the new exhibition of the museum in Semily, which is dedicated to the Velvet Revolution. "The basis is to present what happened in Semily after the events on Národní třída," said the exhibition's curator, Tomáš Chvátal.
"I would say that the atmosphere was the same in the heart of the day, with the first demonstration in Semily on 22 November, and then other people were gradually packed every day," he said. Among the most active was a group of local dissidents around Miroslav Matěcha, who was the only one from the city and immediate surroundings to sign Charter 77, and Mr. and Mr. and Mrs. Grandfather, who were expanding the petition of Several Sentences. Quite quickly, according to Chvátal, the Civic Forum was also created at the time. "One specificity is that there was a strong group of local doctors in the Civic Forum," the curator said.
Approximately 50 photographs should be drawn into the events in the city at the time, the pictures were taken by Karel Bárta 30 years ago. A video from the general strike on 27 November 1989 filmed by František Tomíček, which will be released in a loop throughout the exhibition, was also preserved. Ivan Hlas spoke and sang at the demonstration. The Semilský archive also lent a number of preserved banners to the exhibition. "On them was: Let's not get drunk by a roll, From the trough to the trough, We don't want violence," said Chvátal. Some of the changes in the city were then very quick, for example, people in the exhibition, to be called.
The exhibition also depicts the events before the events of the November events. "In the first part, we present to the witnesses and students who were before, such a late normalization. I think we have managed to gather unique documents from Semil, whether they are banners with various communist slogans or a bronze plate from the then Museum of the Workers' Movement," said Chvátal. One room is just to create a sense of what it might have looked like in the living room of an ordinary household at the time.
The last part of the exhibition is devoted to what was after the Velvet Revolution. It is focused on the first free elections. "We have tilted one of the rooms with election posters. Whoever experienced it will remember the posters With Us to Europe or there is still Václav Klaus under the heading OF with a beautiful motto Everyone for his village," added the curator.
Make fans positive, wishes Hasek. Sparta awaits the game in Pilsen
"We will play at the limit, we will do everything in our power to succeed. To manage the match in the game and the result," promised Spartan Martin Hašek in an interview for the club's television.
In the week, the goal was decided by a cup duel in Jihlava (2-1). Sparta advanced to the next round, which was a duty for her. She was relieved, but the game is still struggling.
Even though the season is slowly spilling over into the second period, Soccer Sparta is still looking for a face to be discussed by coach Václav Jílek early in his engagement.
"But it is still Sparta, which has very high quality players. We are facing a difficult match," warns Pilsen's Roman Procházka.
When the Spartans arrived in the Štruncovy sady for the last time, in the middle of May it was a definite affair in the superstructure. The visitors left after a witightless performance with a 0-4 beat, the largest in the history of the independent Czech league.
While the gap between the clubs in the table was an eight-point match at the time, Sparta now loses nine points after ten games of the new season. He is experiencing one of the worst entries ever for the season.
"It's not an easy situation for us or for the fans who would like to see their beloved club quite different from what it is at the moment," smells Hasek. "But we would like them to continue to support us, stay positive and stand behind us."
Sparta does not know if he will be able to take advantage of Tetteh in Pilsen, who received a two-match penalty for being suspended in Pilsen but appealed against him on Friday.
The numerous sickbies remain Costa, Dockal, Drchal, Panák, Pulkrab, Zahustel, Krejci and Kadlec, who is the only one of the cadre to remember the last Spartan victory in Pilsen in 2011.
The home side, who have won the last five matches, including Wednesday's Cup in Hlučín, should only be missing midfielder Cermak. As a captain, they should be led into the match by defender Jakub Brabec, the Spartan outfielder.
Download for free Metro 2033 Redux and Everything on PC, time is until Thursday
The link to both games is at the Epic Store here. You can include the games in your library directly via the web, but you need to download the Epic Games Launcher client to play.
Metro 2033 Redux is a modified version of the original game from 2010, adding both graphic and playable changes from the Last Light sequel.
The story, based on the motifs of Dmitry Glukhovsky's book of the same name, takes place in 2033 in Russia after the nuclear war. The Earth's surface as we know it no longer exists. Humanity had to take refuge under the ground, in our case in the extensive complexes of the Moscow metro.
"Take the post-apocalyptic world and the oppressive atmosphere from an unfamiliar environment, take it away from the vastness of the world and add a lot of spectacular scripts and action passages and trada: Metro 2033 is in the world," we wrote on Bonusweb in a contemporary review.
Everything, on the other hand, is a relaxing game-not a play in a procedural-generated world that bears the message of the English writer and philosopher Alan Watts. A player can become anything from animals to trees to the planet.

"The hilthar of the study." Islam does not belong to the West, the vast majority of Austrians think
1,200 respondents were interviewed, the survey shows considerable incredulity for Islam in Austrian society.
Almost 60 percent of the Austrian population fear that some Muslims are terrorists, and 48 percent would call for a ban on the construction of mosques. 80 percent are responding to increase the monitoring of the centres of Islam.
Most Austrians also want Muslims to be restricted in their religious practices, claiming that they sometimes feel like foreigners in their own country because of the presence of Muslims.
"The result of the study is frightening," says study author Wolfgang Aschauer, adding: "This tendency to ethnocentrism could eventually lead to the adoption of discriminatory attitudes. There is a risk that the religious freedoms granted to Muslims will be narrowed."
For believers, the critical stance is less pronounced. Aschauer argues that in Austria it is not a conflict between religions, but between cultures. To help blunt the polarization, according to the sociologist, could be dialogue and education.
According to the study, the most hostile attitudes towards Muslims are held by the extreme right's voters, those without higher education or seniors over the age of 75. The most welcoming, on the other hand, are Green voters, people under the age of 30 and undergraduates.
According to estimates by the Austrian Interior Ministry, there are approximately 700,000 Muslims in Austria, which has a population of about 8.7 million. The vast majority have Turkish roots. The country has more than 400 Muslim prayers and mosques, and Islam is officially recognized as a religion since 1912.
Thomas Cook: Czechs kicked out of a hotel in Mallorca. Guarantees were not enough
The Austrian, German and Polish division of the group also filed for insolvency in the week. The future of the Czech branch is currently under negotiation, a decision should be made by the end of September.
According to the vice-chairman of the Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, Jan Papež, there are three options in play for possible solutions - liquidation will be announced, or the company will be sold, or the team from the Czech branch will set up a new travel agency. "Which one of them will be predicted, it will depend on the German owner," he told the Czech News Agency today.
In addition to two prematurely terminated tours, the TA also addresses cases where clients had to pay for their stay out of their own, although the company is trying to provide guarantees to the hoteliers. CK promised to make payments to its clients, according to the Pope, the company has sufficient collateral to do so.
Problems in the hotels arose mainly in Mallorca, where the company also asked the Czech consulate for help. In this context, the Pope described to the Czech Press Agency one of the cases in which the hotel there fired all the tourists' offices. "The hotbender was unable to determine who belongs to the German company and who under the Czech company. Therefore, he fired everyone from the hotel even though the domestic Neckermann provided guarantees," he said. According to Šrámek, the situation was eventually resolved.
The Czech branch of the bankrupt British group Thomas Cook increased its revenues to CZK 995 million last year, up by almost 21 percent year-on-year, according to the company's annual report. It covers the accounting period from October 2017 to the end of September 2018. The company's net profit, on the other hand, fell by about seven million to CZK 15.3 million. However, the company's previous years have lost an unreserved loss of almost 103 million crowns. The branch includes two corner divisions - besides CK Neckermann, it is also the Global Travel Lufthansa City Center.
Trump considers revoked US registration of Chinese stock
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is considering revoked a U.S. stock market trading permit for Chinese firms. An informed source told Reuters today. Such a move would be a radical escalation of trade tensions between the US and China. Shares of the companies in question on the New York Stock Exchange immediately headed down and withdrew the entire market with them.
The withdrawal would be part of a broader effort to cut US investment in China, the source added, confirming a Bloomberg report that had recently caused a shock to the financial markets. Shares in Chinese firms Alibaba Group Holding, JD.com, Pinduoduo, Baidu, Vipshop Holdings, Baozun and IQIYI lost from two to four percent.
According to government data from February, the US exchanges Nasdaq and NYSE are trading shares of 156 Chinese firms, including at least 11 state-owned enterprises.
Bloomberg noted that an exact mechanism had not yet been developed to secure the withdrawal of Chinese firms' shares from the US stock exchanges. Any plan would have to be approved by Trump, who, however, gave the green light to the negotiations on the matter.
China and the US have been waging a trade war for more than a year, with tariffs on each other. The two countries' dispute has had negative effects on the world economy and is raising concerns about the recession of the global economy. Washington is trying to use tariffs to force Beijing to change its trade practices and reduce China's surplus in US trade.
According to CNBC, trade negotiations between the US and China should resume on October 10th, with the aim of ending the trade war.
Police accuse CzechTouism manager Aleš Pangrác of contracts to promote
Police accused the former CzechTourism state agency manager Aleš Pangráce over contracts for promotion. Pangrác confirmed to the server SeznamZprávy that he had taken the charges this week. Czech Television (ČT) reported last year that officers were examining contracts worth CZK 38 million in the case. Police say some of the money was being returned back to Pangrác, writes the server. In the case, the criminalists were also interested in the minister for local development, Klára Dostálová (for ANO), whose ministry CzechTourism falls into.
Detectives from the National Central Office against Organised Crime secured evidence in this case in the second half of last November. For example, they were at the headquarters of the Ministry of Regional Development, at the headquarters of CzechTourism, at the Autodromu in Most or at the Sport Invest agency. The service computer was also taken from the minister's apartment. In the court order for the house search at Dostálová, which was previously quoted by the Czech Television, it said that the minister was deciding in 2016, when she was a deputy, the expenses of CzechTourism to the benefit of the people to the chosen persons to the advantage of the persons, outside of the standard official procedure. At the time, Dostálová said that she felt absolutely innocent, she could document everything with the police.
According to the agency, it was an individual's misconduct. The media had previously reported that they were the former director of the Regional Partnership Department in CzechTourism, Aleš Pangrác, who was dismissed for the results of the audit. This showed that the CzechTourism agency had concluded 48 problematic treaties.
"Yes, I've been accused, but that's all I want to say," Pangrác told the North List of News.

From a religious school in Nigeria, hundreds of enslaved children freed
According to the BBC, there were nearly five hundred men and boys, Reuters, citing the police commissioner, reported that there were over three hundred children from the age of five above. Some were chained to each other, others were tied to iron circles in the wall.
The head of the police in Kadne, Ali Janga, told the BBC that the raid at the school was conducted on the basis of a tip-up. He described the school as a house of horrors. The starving people there were forcibly, tortured and sexually abused. They could not leave, there was a razor wire above the walls. According to him, it is a case of slavery.
Several people were detained in the raid, according to police spokesman Jakub Sabo, the local teacher.
The children told the police that they were taken to the school by parents or relatives, saying it was a religious school. "We identified two children who come from Burkina Faso, but most were brought here by parents from Nigerian states in the north," a Sabo spokesman said on the identity of the victims. Nigerian states in the north of the country are predominantly Muslim.
The school of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal was posing as a religious school dedicated to studying the Koran.
The liberation was taken to the stadium, where they are provided with help and food. Some have already met with relatives.
French chef sues Michelin over star removal. I suffer from depression, says
The renowned French chef Marc Veyrat lost his third Michelin star in January this year, a year after he acquired it. The publisher of the red guide intends to sue in order to receive the exact reasons for the degradation. Veyrat also doubts the competencies of the Michelin-starred inspectors, who he says have misthea for saffa did to milling the cheddar. The first court trial is due to take place in November.
The chef of the famous restaurant La Maison de Bois in the Alpine region of Upper Savoy lost one of his three Michelin stars in January of this year. The publisher of the prestigious Le Guide Michelin will be sued because the commissioners' conclusion was not properly justified. Moreover, he said, the star's removal took place without any notice. "I suffer from depression for six months. How dare you to play with the health of chefs?" he told the commissioners.
Michelin is said to have provided the chef with vague reasons, such as that the chef put on the souflé cheddar, which the inspection did not like. "I put saffron into it and those gentlemen thought it was cheddar because it was yellow because it was yellow. I have worked with love with the love with the savoy ingredients," he objected to the decision of Veyrat. He is convinced of the strong incompetence of the Michelin commissioners: "You are the crooks who only evoke disputes for commercial reasons."
The prominent chef, always wearing a black hat and dark glasses, is an opponent of the new generation of Michelin commissioners, and therefore calls for the removal of his restaurant from the red guide. However, the publisher refuses to do so. "If the business remains open and our inspectors select it again, we will continue to recommend it," says Gwendal Poullennec, Michelin International Director.
According to Michelin, the chef's lawsuit testifies to the fact that he does not yet have any meaningful accusation and the lawyer is yet to help him formulate it. "We regret that Mr. Veyrat is communicating with us rudely. However, we will examine his comments carefully," he said.
In addition to La Maison de Bois, Marc Veyart owns two three-star restaurants.
Technically perfect confusion with a weak script. Gemini with Will Smith's criticisms
The Dystopian sci-fi spectacle of Gemini Man boasts an interesting premise - Will Smith will face his younger version in the film. According to critics, however, the story is the weakest part of the film. The film will be shown in Czech cinemas on October 10.
Henry Brogan (Will Smith) is the absolute top of his field. He kills effectively and without unnecessary questions. But one day he decides to hang up his career. Of course, this is not to his employers who send another assassin to Henry. The catch is that the killer is Henry himself, more specifically his younger clone made of DNA. Can one of the determined people win the fight over himself? This time, literally.
Three-time Oscar winner Ang Lee was supposed to be a sure guarantee of quality. It's his first sci-fi, but he has a wealth of experience with dramatic action films, as he demonstrated in the aforementioned Tiger and the Dragon or the western Ride with the Devil. Six screenwriters have collaborated on the script. The most famous is certainly David Benioff, one of the creators of the highly successful Game of Thrones. According to the first reviews, however, this was not enough for a good movie.
"Even though Ang Lee is trying to do great things in technical filmmaking, the film itself doesn't have the character to highlight it," thinks Fionnuala Hannigan of the Screen Daily.
"This unsatisfactory film is less than the sum of all the talents involved. The weak script and plot are held together only by the technological magic of the filmmakers," Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter summarized his opinion.
"The slippery is a case in which a huge amount of work resulted in an impossibly unsynit action film," Variety reviewer Peter Deburge says.
"A confused product with a bizarre idea," Ella Kemp summarized from the IndieWire website in her review.
"It's hard to be interested in the fact that one man is the other's double when neither behave like a person," wrote Nicholas Barber of The Wrap.
List of bank accounts for children on the Czech market
The children's accounts are provided by the banks for free. However, the offer must be considered because some other services to the accounts are already charged. "The motivation of banks to offer accounts for children, whose basic management is free, is straightforward. Financial houses are counting on their forgiven fees to be refunded one day. With a small migration of Czechs among banks, they are probably right," says Kristýna Kuncová from dTest.
"Little bills", she says, can do almost anything that adult accounts do. A child gets his own payment card, can enter payments, track up movements in the account, somewhere he has his own electronic banking. Banks set up the account, but it is up to the parents to teach them how to handle the children and also check their payment.
"After all, flexibly, a parent can set weekly or monthly limits, turn on and off individual services and the like. Above all, they can monitor what is happening in the account, whether by looking at the internet or by information SMS. Attention, they may no longer be free," Kuncová adds, adding: "If a parent is considering an account for their child, he should consider his or her abilities and options."
Strict but fair, we enjoy the clock! That's how the Benešov Gymnastics see their favourite teacher writer
Humanism should be present in every good book, believes Pavel Hoza. The high school teacher of Czech and history is also a poet, a prose writer and a fist of literary life in a small town.

This Reynek's Contemporary Continuer teaches at the grammar school in Beneš's Czech, literature and history, in the word Café there shears the word for the Prague Viola and annually holds the Benešov literary festival.
Wife swap: Ondra's parents cruelly abused! He ended up in the institution
It was about nerves. The allegedly troubled son Ondřej (9) was harshly punished by his father every moment. "He came from school and lied to himself with a snack. Lukas looked at me and said that he would kneel as a punishment," described Lucie in the Weimolds in the Weed. My dad Lukáš forced small Ondra to kneel in the corner for several hours! Besides the camera, he said he had to suffer like this on a wooden underdog for a wooden foot massage! "Ondřej came to me after the shoot and told me - Aunt, I'm just doing the trouble and notes to not be here, because I want to go to the institute," Lucie said, describing the moment when she fully understood the boys's door.
His condition was so serious that he was taken away from his family after filming and placed for a month at the Centre for Educational Care in České Budějovice. He returned to his father and surrogate mother Aneta (28) for a short time, but then he went to a diagnostic institute for troubled children. "When I came home, Aneta immediately added me on Facebook, we wrote for a while. She was most interested in whether we had received the money. I hardly responded to that at all. But then she wrote to me that he was in the institute that then he was returned to them, he is now in a diagram. They are both without a job," says the mother of Luna.
Lightning, of course, also approached the other side, but only got a vague answer. "I'm not in the mood, I'm sick, call out later," Aneta said, and hung up the phone.
Sparta doesn't want to lose Tetteh in Pilsen. She appealed against a double-header penalty
Soccer Sparta appealed against a two-game penalty for striker Benjamin Tetteh, who received the player from the disciplinary committee for being suspended in Sunday's derby with Slavia (0-3).
The Letenský klub informed about this on their Twitter feed and is now awaiting the verdict of the appeals committee.
Tetteh has already served half of his penalty in Wednesday's home cup match in Jihlava. Sparta is now seeking to have the 22-year-old Ghanaian striker play in the 11th round of the first league in Plzeň on Sunday.
The situation last October could be repeated. At the time, Olomouc appealed the penalty for Šimon Falta, who received a one-game suspension from the Disciplinary Board on Thursday for dismissal against Liberec.
The appeal committee failed to discuss the case, so it dropped the effectiveness of the penalty and Falta was able to start on Saturday, ironically against Sparta.
The committee finally confirmed the one-match penalty for the Olomouc midfielder in the next week and Falta missed the following duel with Zlín.
Disciplinary Tetteh's discipline stopped his activity for a foul on the Glory's David Hovorka, for which he received a flat red card from referee Miroslav Zelinka in the 82nd minute.
The alleged spitting of the Ghanaian player on the captain of opponent Tomáš Souček has not been proven.
The Germans chose Keller to lead the Football Association
The new chairman of the German Football Association, as expected, became the current head of the Bundesliga side Freiburg, Fritz Keller. The 62-year-old winemaker, gastronomer and hotelier was elected unanimously for three years, he did not have an opponent.
Keller replaced Reinhard Grindel, who resigned in April over the unacknowledged income affair. His other predecessors, Theo Zwanziger, and Wolfgang Niersbach, will go to trial for possible bribes when they award the 2006 World Cup.
Keller said that one of the main goals would be to restore the union's confidence and lift him out of the crisis. "It will be no One Man Show, many people will take responsibility. The union is better than its reputation," said Keller, who presented all of his tasks under the slogan: Together, we can do it.
After being elected to head the union, Keller left the post in Freiburg.
There was a fire in the underground of the ČSA mine in Karviná, no one was injured
There was a fire in the ČSA mine underground in Karviná this morning. The cause of the fire is not yet known. However, no one was injured in it, a spokesperson for the mining company Ivo Čelechovský told the Czech Press Agency.
The fire broke out at 04:25 in the booth at a depth of about 1,200 meters. "No one of the employees was harmed, no one was injured. Bán ma'am rescuers immediately attended the scene, who disposed of the fire by direct intervention and carried out the examination of the terrain. The workplace was immediately closed and inaccessible," the spokesman said. The exact cause of the fire will now be investigated by a special commission.
The former Ostrava-Karviná district is already mined with coal only in the Karviná part, in the mines of ČSA, Lazy, Darkov, ČSM-Sever and ČSM-South. In Dole Lazy, production should end later this year, the gradual downturn awaits other mines. The mining company OKD is the only producer of hard coal in the Czech Republic, its production last year was 4.62 million tonnes. 9,000 people are in the mines.
Berlin responds to public pressure and addresses housing crisis. It will buy 6,000 flats from a private company
Berlin will buy back from the private Luxembourg-based firm ADO Properties SA for 920 million euros ($23.8 billion) of the former social housing that the city sold 15 years ago. It responds to public pressure that is rebelling against the skyrocketing rents prices. According to Berlin senator Katrin Lompscher for the Left Party (Die Linke), it is the largest such buyout ever in the history of the capital city of Germany. The opposition is criticising the move.
"The intention is to keep the rents stable in Berlin and give the tenants certainty," Berlin Mayor Michael Müller (SPD) said in a statement. "At the same time, we will continue to build new flats and legally treat the freezing of rents," he added. The municipal company Gewobag will take in thousands of flats located in the Spandau districts and Reinickendorf in the western part of the city this December.
According to Jefferies analyst Thomas Rothäusler, the city bought too expensive. Bloomberg Rothäusler told him that he estimated the housing units to overpay by about ten percent above their book value.
According to the German opposition party, the Liberals (FDP) of the Berlin authorities are contributing to the real estate speculation by their actions. The FDP said on twitter on Friday. The "worry of money" was described as the move by the protest party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Already in the middle of July, Gewobag won back 670 flats in Berlin's Karl-Marx-Allee street, the weekly Der Spiegel recalled on its website. The council did not publish the award at the time. The controversy over the flats on the former exhibition avenue from the days of the GDR was accompanied by protests and filled the front pages of the German press. It became a symbol of the oppressive situation of tenants in major German cities, the paper wrote.
Meanwhile, the German metropolis used to be renowned for low cost of living and low rents. In recent years, however, it has gained attraction. According to AFP, rental prices have doubled over the past decade, and some residents find it difficult to find affordable housing.
Nokia is suing the Brno-based company over the name Lokia. People will not mistake us for us, believes the Moravians
Nokia filed objections to the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. However, according to the CCV, the product mix-up is unlikely.
The Brno-based company developing software CCV is facing legal action from the Finnish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Nokia. Finns do not like the fact that the Brno-based warehouse management company's program is appointed by Lokia WMS, wrote E15. So Nokia filed a objection to the Lokia brand's application to the Industrial Property Office. CCV reckons that confusion is not likely.
Marketing Director Petr Ondrášek said that the program is already used by two dozen customers, the market has been on the market since last September.
"The Nokia brand enjoys recognition and trust around the world. When someone attempts to register a stamp we believe may lead to a confusion or weakening of our brand, we take steps to protect our valuable asset," said spokesman Nokie Mark Durrant.
Brno developers claim that they were not thinking about the brand famous for mobile phones in the past when creating a stock program. The designation of Lokia according to CCV is based on the Latin name for one kind of weighing-in, the rapid movement of which is supposed to be an analogy of the movement of storekeepers around the warehouse.
"In the Czech market, the possibility of substitution is unlikely. We sell modern cloud software, which companies equip with their warehouse operations, and we are not really heading to the production of mobile phones. And we do not want a comparison to a brand that may be fled by a train in its field," CCV manager Tomáš Kormaňák responded in E15.
The CCV applied for the brand's protection in August before the program was launched at the Industrial Property Office. "Protection applied for products and services in Classes 9, 35 and 42, as the software belongs to Class 9, the related business business management service in the warehouse belongs to the class 35 and the development of computer software into Class 42 according to the international classification," Ondrášek said.
Nokia's objection is based on the fact that the earlier mark Nokia is valid in all classes of goods and services and thus applies to the broadest possible range of goods and services, and therefore, of course, overlap in the classes of classes 9, 35 and 42. "CCV does not question the assertion of the objecting to these product and service classes.
The brand dispute could take months, according to E15, and it may complicate the company's operations.
From Sydney to London in four hours? In 2030, perhaps reality
The Sabre combines a classic aircraft engine with a missile. It is designed to powered at twice the speed at speeds as the Concordy flew. "When the Sabre engine is put into service, it could allow us to reach Australia in about four hours," said Turnock. And for example, the distance between London and New York would be able to cover the plane in one hour.
The Independent notes that the so-called hypersonic flights, in which the speed of sound are five-fold in excess, are complicated because of the engine overheating. However, the Sabre (Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine) should deal with this problem by using a super cold helium that should prevent temperatures from rising.
"The most important thing about the Sabre is that it is a hybrid of a rocket and aircraft engine that is powered by a jet of exhaust generated from the air," says Shaun Driscoll of Reaction Engines. "The treats have not undergone such a big development in the last 70 years, while the aircraft have. So when you combine the engines, you can have a very light and efficient propulsion system and basically create a spaceplane," he said.
The engine is currently being tested, with test flights expected to start around the middle of next year. Commercial flights around 2030.
Kovosvit sells the administrative building and other halls. It expects worse times
Due to the restructuring, Kovosvit ended with a consolidated loss of CZK 100 million last year, the consolidated turnover was CZK 1.3 billion. Last year's main problems include a shortage of workers and shifts of subcontractors. This year, demand for machine tools fell by 10 to 20 percent year-on-year. "This is also related to the expected decline in turnover of the order of ten percent," said the CEO. In 2017, Kovosvit had revenues of 1.3 billion crowns and profit after tax was 40.1 million.
Kovosvit is now offering for sale several properties, halls and land that it either does not use or minimally. This also applies to the office building, where it uses two from five floors, and not quite yet. "Part of the long-term restructuring plan, it is to reduce Kovosvit to streamline its activities. The sale of assets is not part of a current solution, whether it is a cash-flow, but part of a long-term plan when we want to devote all resources to investment development," the CEO said.
About half of Kovosvit's production is exported. Its standard markets are the EU and Russia, last year to a lesser extent Asia. This year, Chef ranks among the most interesting India, where Kovosvit won a contract for machines allowing five-axis machining worth 100 million crowns. This year, the company also exported two five-axis machines for 30 million crowns to China. "Another contract is agreed in the same volume that we would like to fulfill before the end of the year," said Kuchař.
Last year, the company sold two five-axis machining centres to France, the subcontractor of Airbus. It supplied it with another machine in May this year, with one more to deliver at the end of the year or early 2020.
The main company investment this year was the transfer of heating from the steam to the heat water for CZK 20 million. Kovosvit employs 500 people, the average worker wage is CZK 28,500. The company is looking for bricings of castings for the foundry, machinists, turners and electricians.
The company has been owned since September 2016 by industrialist and arms producer Jaroslav Strnad. The company has a tradition in the production of machine tools. It was founded by Tomáš Baťa in 1939. The company had up to three thousand employees at the time.
Milan Jakubů: The funeral was stolen by the army for itself! Says Andor Shandor
There is still confusion surrounding the funeral of Brigadier General Milan Jakubů. The media speculated in the week that the army planned the last farewell to the deputy director of the Military Investigation, despite the family's wishes, as the soldiers do. There were also irregularities regarding the date of the funeral. Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek denied this.
"It's nonsense! We've been in contact with the family from the beginning, the appointment of Friday's funeral is valid from the beginning, no one has changed it. As well as the military honours apply. We will still deal with the possible participation of the media with regard to the family," Pejšek told Lightning on Wednesday. The funeral will finally take place really on Friday and will not be missing all military honours, including the overtures of the fighters.
Around the last farewell to the popular general, however, there is still a tense atmosphere. The funeral ceremony is not attended by the people who worked with the general in the past!
For example, the former head of military intelligence, Andor Shandor (62), who met Milan Jakubů 17 years ago. Shandor remembers the former colleague as a hard-working, intelligent and "good guy."
In addition, he met him regularly in recent years at the anniversary celebrations of the anniversary of the founding of Military Intelligence. That is why he would like to say goodbye to Milan Jakubů. "I personally would go to the funeral of Milan Jakub," said Blesku Šándor. But he cannot.
"I also know of other people from the organization who would like to go but are unlucky because the potentates usurp the funeral for themselves. I think that this is not the right to privatize the funeral," the security expert said. He is not even playing into the supposedly considered closure of the ceremony for the public because of the secrecy of army leaders.
"The leadership of the army is not undercover and the leaders of the military intelligence are not, because they are to be promoted at Prague Castle, we see it there. If the information of the media is true and the family has actually been arrested by the army, this is of course a matter for the family. I personally would never allow the army to overrally overrally and its wishes," concluded Shandor.
Milan Jakubů died on Saturday near Špindlerův Mlýn in a car accident. The head-on collision between Milan's Rapid and the Ford Mustang was allegedly caused by the driver of the sports car Vojtěch Ch. (31).
The amateur racer was supposed to enter the opposite direction on a bend, Milan Jakubů apparently had no chance to prevent the collision. His wife (47) suffered serious injuries in the accident and it is possible that the consequences will be carried for the rest of his life. Police interviewed the culprit of the accident on Thursday.
Comment by Jan Šindelář: Run the railways as a company
The Heavens' election, although apparently not entirely smooth, is the culmination of a sad story about the state's inability to give the runways a clear direction. The board of directors has been incomplete for over a year, and even after Wednesday evening, this does not change because one of the members resigned. The Provision is ongoing.
The selection process itself was a farce from the outset because the requirements for candidates were significantly eased in the area of practice. Compared to the selection last year, the requirements for the size of the company in which the candidate was to operate in the past were reduced. First, the members of the selection committee and then the supervisory boards played only the role of pimprlat.
Heavenly presented perhaps the weakest professional CV of the five finalists, yet without experience from a large company he rubled up experienced fighters from the management of logistics giants and transport businesses. The participation of interesting private sector managers was perhaps the most illustrators (and best hope) of the process. Today, those concerned know that they played only the role of the narcre following a backdrop in the political game.
Perhaps the Sky will surprise, show a great talent and eventually turn out to be the best head of the railways of all time. At least in the beginning, however, he will be accompanied by the aftertaste of political newsagents. Czech Railways does not expect an easy period, it must cope with the competition in the liberalization of the market and the lack of employees in operation. Missing are the drivers, the shrollers and mechanics. What motivation are they to have for further work and respect for management when the state behaves in the top line like an elephant in a china?
The second important group is the creditors. How to set out the games at the head of the runways will be seen next spring when the tracks defend the rating. What is certain is that creditors perceive instability. Sadly, the Moody's agency goes to the Moody's agency to defend the rating every year to defend the rating. The agency's frequent changes in runway management and political influence on the company have not escaped the agency, it criticized them already this summer.
The ANO movement speares, among other things, the slogan that the state must be run as a company. For a start, it would be enough for one large state company to run as a company and not as a state. Czech Railways is still one of the largest companies in the country and it would be good if the best were run by them. They reported, but the state despised them. Surely one can argue that the post at the head of the runways was always a political matter. But then we can forge a fuscakes.
The pair wrapped the bitch with tape and drowned in the river, the children found the bag
The case took place at the end of July in the village around the Wallachian Hats. A 27-year-old woman brought home a donated dog an old one to two years old that she wanted to take care of. However, her ten-year-old partner did not like that he was a bitch, so he decided to get rid of it.
"He wrapped the animal with duct tape and rope and greatly eliminated his voice. He put the dog in a jute bag, which he tied. Then they took the animal together to the river, where they threw it in the bag. The dog was demonstrably lived in the moment," said Zlín police spokesperson Monika Kozumplíková.
The following day, the children who were playing by the river found a jute bag on the bank. When they opened it, they discovered the body of a dead dog inside. So they called to the woman passing by and fled. The woman announced the incident to the emergency number of police 158.
"The officers, thanks to the knowledge of the town's residents, found out who the perpetrator of this incredible act was. And they were not wrong. Both the man and the woman confessed to the crime and described how the event took place," the police spokesperson said.
Expert comments in veterinary medicine confirmed that the dog died in a decidedly harrowing manner due to suffocation, when the animal suffered in a matter of minutes before its death.
"The actions of the perpetrators undoubtedly point to the clear intention to get rid of the animal at all costs in this reprehensible manner, even if they could donate or sell the dog. The criminal police commissioner from Zlín accused the couple of committing the crime of animal cruelty committed in accessory. Both hitherto unpunished charges could spend up to three years behind bars if convicted," Kozumplíková noted.
Thank you for the dance! Singer Leonard Cohen will be released posthumously last album
The album Thank You for Dance (Thanks for the Dance) will feature unforced material and various musical collaborations put together by the singer's son. The album will be released on November 22.
In October 2016, the album You Want it Darker was released, on which Cohen collaborated with his son Adam. He asked him to help him finish the songs. On the intimate recording, Cohen symbolically cope with the impending death. He died a month after the release of the album at the age of 82.
Seven months later, Adam Cohen began working on the materials he was left with after his father. He invited a number of musicians to collaborate - Damien Rice, Bryce Dessner, Javier Mas or the singer Beck at random.
"When we invented the music for the father's words, we used his own characteristic musical techniques. So he is always with us," Adam Cohen said of the album. "What impresses me most about him is the reactions of those who have already heard him. One by one, they say that Leonard is still alive," he added.
The first swallow of the album is the short-league song The Goal. "I'm almost alive, I'm almost at home," he sings in his distinctive honeyed voice, Cohen. He sings about death, suspecting that he would not live to see the release of the new material. He also admitted this in an interview with The New Yorker magazine a month before he died. "I'm ready to die. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable," he said.
In September 2018, Adam Cohen published his father's poetry collection called The Flame. It will be published in Czech on December 31 by the publisher Argo.
First Miss Christ came at last into herself: She lost a few pounds and immediately made it through
The first modern Miss from 1989 Ivana Christová (49) had overweight problems for years, which caused her not only physical problems, but mainly the psychological ones. She suffered from the fact that she had changed a lot since the Miss Czechoslovakia pageant. But now it looks like she took the rebukes to heart and went into battle with the excess pounds. Even though it's a long shot.
She used to be a first-class beauty who also conquered Paris. But it has been thirty years since then, and Ivana Christová can only remember the beauty page competition. Not only for the glory, but also because of how thin she was.
Over time, she decided not to submit to strict modeling rules, which ordered her to be as skimmic and often not eating as possible. She decided to stop listening and began to indulge in what she was in the mood for.
But she went from hunger striking to overeating, which immediately signed on to her figure. In addition, Kila tried to disguise various free clothes, but it added to the hip-tranky shapes.
Now it looks like Ivana really went into herself. She has visibly lost weight, began to dress tastefully and appropriately to her fuller figure.
All those present were surprised at the christening of the book by Milos Zapletal (75) that she had seen through again and already had back the features of the glamorous brunette, who in 1989 entered history not only as the first Miss winner after the revolution, but also by the controversy her victory.
Christová will be the first beauty winner forever, but also the very first one, which the audience at the Palace of Culture and Sport in Ostrava whistle was whistled as a desertal when she put on a crown.
"Parodie to Justice." Scientist warned of cancer from pollution, sits in Turkish prison
Sik, along with other scientists, participated in a study commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Health between 2011 and 2015. Its conclusion was that water, soil and food pollution in some industrial areas in the west of the country was linked to an increased incidence of cancer in local residents.
The scientists mentioned mainly the industrial zone of Dilovasi, which is about 80 kilometers from Istanbul, and where a number of chemical and smalcrafighting plants are based. People living in it, according to them, suffer from cancer far more often than the international average.
Erdogan is in revenge for the coup, international criticism notwithstanding
It seemed to Sik that the government did not take any action on the matter, notwithstanding the clear findings of the study. He therefore wrote several articles about the research in the opposition daily Cumhuriyet. Authorities subsequently began to prosecute him for leaking classified information.
"The study clearly showed the extent to which water sources were contaminated with toxic substances," Sik told reporters after the verdict. "The court's decision shows that the results of the studies directly related to public health can be withholded. This is unacceptable," the scientist added.
"The Turkish authorities, instead of persecuting the alarm people through the courts, should investigate this important problem for public health," said Andrew Gardner of the AI branch in Turkey.
Organisations involved in the protection of the environment and human rights have long accused the Turkish government of not enforcing environmental regulations in certain regions, despite the rapid development of industry.
After the thwarted 2016 coup, the regime of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan launched a large wave of arrests. Nearly 80,000 people are now behind bars, including a number of Cumhuriyet staff. Authorities have also suspended the service or completely laid off 150,000 civil servants and armed forces.
The opposition and human rights organizations accuse the government of using the attempted coup to persecute its opponents, but the authorities are defying the measures needed to ensure national security.
The fastest man on the planet missed tests. I don't take anything, he fights back
The traditionally highly watched contest for the fastest man on the planet will be a hurry at the World Championships on the defending silver champion Christian Coleman. The 23-year-old is the world leader in the world standings with a time of 9.81 seconds and only lost once this year. However, his start at the height of the season was at risk due to the missed doping exams.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) closed his case in early September without being charged for formal reasons. Coleman did not take three doping tests last year and this year, but not in 12 months. His first offense was dated back to 1 April 2018, the start of the second quarter, however, the test itself did not take place until June 6. And since the third overdoing took place on April 29, 2019, Coleman did not commit guilty in the form of three unchecked checks within 12 months.
Coleman argued that he had only forgotten to update the data in the athlete's whereabouts application. "I don't take drugs or take anything legal. A lot of athletes use legal creatine or protein powder or various other supplements for faster regeneration. And I don't take anything, I work hard and that's what it's about," he said before the start of MS.
The only defeat in his six starts at the 100 this year was suffered as he entered the season at the Diamond League in Shanghai, where he was outnchated by compatriot Noah Lyles by just six thousandths of a second. He took advantage of Coleman's absence to triumph in the Diamond League final, but will only run a 200 at the World Championships.
The paper's second fastest competitor, with a performance of 9.86, is 22-year-old Nigerian-based Nigerian, Divine Oduduru, who has only done well at the US college competitions so far.
Defending the title will be the 37-year-old American Justin Gatlin, who flashed a time of 9.87 at Stanford in June. He ran the last 100 in Zagreb but only in 10.29 because he slightly injured his back thigh muscle.
The favourite circuit also includes South African Akani Simbine, three-time Olympic medalist from Rio Andre de Grasse or European champion Zharnel Hughes. The fastest Jamaican is the 2011 world champion Yohan Blake with a time of 9.96 years.
The men's 100 will begin on Friday with a pre-chille and heaters. The semi-finals and finals are on Saturday. The medals will be run at 21:15 BST.
Flight crash at Žinkov in Pilsen: Two people did not survive the accident
Two people, a man (†63) and a woman (†38) were travelling on the plane on the plane at 8:30 p.m. requesting permission to land at the Chaloupka airport near Klatovy," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said. This was also the last recording, at which time the GPS coordinates should have been located at Vojovice near Žinkov.
It did not arrive at the Klatovy airport, however. A search was immediately started after the lost aircraft, which sent out a distress signal. "A military helicopter was involved in addition to the police," said police spokesperson Martina Korandová.
In the forest near Petrovic, near Měčín, which is about six kilometres from where the plane was lasted, before 9 a.m. the wreckage of the helicopter crew noticed the wreckage. "We found a plane and two bodies with no signs of life," Korandová confirmed.
The crashed machine remained partially wedged in the branches of the trees, the pieces also hit the ground in the vicinity. "We will investigate the cause of the accident in cooperation with expert experts and staff of the Institute for Professional Investigation of the Causes of Air Accidents," Korandová added.
Civilization in the best of time
Recently, I was reminded of a beautiful "clipot" from one of the great short stories, Simek and Grossmann, taking place partly in the cemetery, which reads as follows: "I pointed out to her that she is crying well, but on a foreign grave!" I thought that very similarly now behave many of the world's politicians involved in the senseless fight against climate change.
They behise as if people were ruled on planet Earth. In fact, we are just a speck on its surface, which she can blow out with her ginger with her ginger as a fierce gusto of wind a candle flame. Few of them look at the famous British and American natural history documents dealing with the destructiveness of our blue ball. After all, it would be enough for one of the larger active volcanoes to be properly "uphailed" and our advanced civilization pooches from it.
And that this will happen in the near future is highly likely. A number of large volcanoes, in the view of leading volcanologists, are "charged and armed" (for example, by Katla in Iceland).
In a way, it would be ideal if the eruption, if it has to happen, happened as soon as possible. Even before the billions of dollars are wasted in a completely unnecessary way to take measures to reduce carbon dioxide production, because any properly angry volcano, along with the dust and poisonous volcanic gases, can release it into the air at least a hundred times than has been spared at the expense of the people of Europe.
It therefore makes no sense to restrict CO2 production. Moreover, it has been scientifically proven that, with its significantly higher share in the air, the plants are more biological matter and are also more drought-resistant. For mankind, any warming is significantly more favorable than, for example, the rapid return of the Ice Age would be.
If we realize the still under-explored impact of solar cycles on the Earth's climate, we must come to only one reasonable conclusion: Let us try to keep the Earth as pure as possible, and to other changes with which we cannot measure ourselves against by force, try to adapt to the smallest cost!
Repair of the Krkonoše Museum will be a year late
The Krkonoše National Park Authority (KRNAP) pushed the deadline for submitting bids to the second tender for the repair of the Krkonoše Museum in Vrchlabi for three weeks. The original deadline for the opening of the envelopes was on September 20, said the spokesman of the national park Radek Drahný. The reason for the postponing of the deadline for the submission of bids is to reduce the budget from CZK 110 million to CZK 83 million.
"We are currently working with prices that are on the market. There has been a change of budget, it is a price that we expect to be offered. If someone makes a bid that is acceptable, then the work will start as soon as possible," Drahný said.
Compared to the original plans, the start of the museum's repair is about a year late. KRNAP wanted to have a selected contractor of the construction part by the end of last year and this spring with construction work. According to the management of the National Park Authority, the European subsidies of 123 million crowns for the project are not at risk.
The administration of KRNAP is failing to select the construction company for the museum's repairs. It announced the second competition this summer, as in the previous tender all the company's bids far exceeded the then projected price of 65 million. Offers exceeded 100 million crowns.
The museum, which is based in the former Augustinian monastery and belongs to the KRNAP Administration, has been closed since autumn 2017. The selected company should provide for the construction part of the project. The total cost, including the construction of the new exhibition, is estimated at CZK 210 million. In the now cleared building, the KRNAP visitor centre should be established by the end of 2021.
The repaired museum with a new interactive exhibition, which should be the story of nature and people perched in the mountains and build on the successful Stone and Life Exhibition, should serve for visitors as a representative entrance gate of the Giant Mountains. The visitor centre should provide the most informable form of information about the past and present of the Giant Mountains and motivate people to discover the mountains and protect them. It should also take over the role of the traditional museum. The Centre will also offer opportunities for organizing concerts, festivals, theatre performances or open-air lectures. In the plans, the construction of a new entrance to the object, is the creation of a researcher or a café.
Toyota of hydrogen still believes, preparing second generation of Mirai
Toyota Mirai was never just supposed to be a concept. Toyota was so serious about her that even though there was practically no hydrogen pumping infrastructure in the world, she put it on the menu. Not in the very standard, the customer had to really go after this car in a targeted way, but no one else offered such a variant at the time.
Toyota's chief executive, Takeshi Uchiyamada, confirmed at an international hydrogen conference that a new generation will be coming next year. Toyota still believes that these cars have a future and will be priced for hybrids within a decade. Of course, this is linked to the development of pumping networks. However, the future is linked to hydrogen as much as electricity.
The conference often used to bring down the word hydrogen with the needs of ecological operation not for passenger cars, but on the contrary for large trucks, ships, trains, etc.Just those means of transport that need to be overcome for one long-distance refueling. The purely accumulator versions cannot offer this. Toyota could thus find new outlets thanks to great experience and long development.
It remains to be noted that, like Toyota, Hyundai, which now also offers the Nexo hydrogen crossover, believes in hydrogen propulsion.
Strawberry, plum and invisible. Choose the right shade of lipstick: There's not just one red
When choosing red lipstick, you should first determine whether you are a warm or cold type. Try a simple test - check out the veins on your wrist. If they are blue, you are a cold type, if in green, then you are one of the warm types. When choosing a new red lipstick, give it in the first place to be a set-up based on the undertone. Only in the next one, look at the texture.
If you join women with a cold undertone, then lipsticks are suitable for you in purple, plum, cherry or mauve in colour.
If you fall into the category of warm skin undertones, choose such lipsticks as well. You will recognize them by attentive to orange, coral, gold or brown reflections.
It may happen to you that some veins look green and others look blue. In that case, congratulate yourself - you don't have to look at the undertone and you can only focus on your colorful preferences.
Purpose gossip? The Ústí Zoo is looking for a new veterinarian, no one is interested
The last time at the end of this month. The city's leadership attributes this to the rumors that sprang up around the former director of the zoo and at the same time the veterinarian Václav He was the one who was being purposeful of killing the exotic animals he cared for. For example, the female rhino Zamba, the elephant Kalu or the orangutan Ňuňák.
The Municipal Council has therefore announced a new contract. "For veterinary care for the zoo with an estimated value of the CZK 3.5 million performance without VAT and for the city's Centre for Pets in need with an estimated value of the performance of CZK 2.8 million without VAT," said city spokesperson Romana Macová.
Deputy Mayor Věra Nechybová (UFO) explained that the city is announcing a competition for veterinary services for the third time. "The Dr. Poživil had to explain the unsubstantiated suspicions. I consider it an outrageous defamation of such a quality expert," she noted.
Experts specialized in exotic animals are, she says, very few. "It is certainly not pleasant. The zoo provides veterinary care in the form of orders so far," she said. The order and contract cost the same money. "The garden, however, must comply with the Public Procurement Act in terms of funding," explained zoo spokesperson Nikola Roštejnská.
Václav Poživil himself is among the respected experts. He participated, for example, in a unique operation in which the Ústí cheetahs of Jane received a total prosthesis as the first cheetah in the world. He performed the role of director of the zoo between 2009 and 2012. He did not comment on anonymous slander on his person. Yesterday, he did not receive phone calls or respond to text messages of text.
As far as the commission for the zoo is concerned, some veterinarians think that there is not necessarily any concern about it is not necessarily to be a concern about such special allegations, as in his case, but simply a little information. For example, the veterinarian in Ústí nad Labem has not heard from her. "I am hearing this for the first time. No one has approached us. Such a thing, I think, will quickly spread," he added.
Line D to be supervised by new Tube architect, brings experience from London Underground
The Prague Transport Company has chosen an architect to oversee the shape of the metropolitan metro. Anna Švarc will become it from October, her first task will be the look of the new line D, but she will also be in charge of the existing stations. The metro, according to her, cannot be viewed only as a transport construction, the underground travel should also bring an aesthetic experience.
The Czech architect, who was co-authored, for example, in the reconstruction of three London metro stations, won the tender launched by the Prague Transport Company (DPP).
In addition to it, another 14 applicants took part in the tender. "Part of the selection procedure was a motivation letter and a CV. Apparently, my previous practice from London decided, where I created a kind of aesthetic manual for the metro there in the team of three people," says the new architect of the metro.
Metro does not only see it as a traffic fucchin building. The stations should also have aesthetic value.
"I have to learn about how the metro will change, how the space will be to be improving. How it will be realistically will be done, I will not know until the coming weeks, when the transport company introduces me to my ideas," says Švarc.
"This is not a series of dogmas, but rather recommendations aimed at maintaining the context of all stations in the event of being reconstructed," the manual says.
Whether a similar instrument is also a way to improve public space in the Prague metro is a question. The Prague Metro is specific. "Whenever the manual is ideal or whether a personality can cover it, I really don't know yet," Švarc concludes.
Former French President Chirac will be buried on Monday, public commemoration will be on Sunday
The funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac, who died on Thursday at the age of 86, will take place on Monday evening at the Montparnasse cemetery in Paris. French media reporting the news, citing the Chirac family.
The public will be able to say goodbye to the former head of state on Sunday afternoon at the commemoration at Paris's Invalides, where a coffin with the Chirac's remains will be displayed, the Élysée Palace announced.

Meanwhile, further reactions from the world and from France are coming to the death of the former mayor of Paris and the president from 1995 to 2007, who Prime Minister Édouard Philippe today called "Francouze in the truest sense of the word."
Chirac was remembered by the Japanese, for example, as the politician was known for his love for their country and sports suo. The news of the former French president's death appeared on the front pages of all Japanese newspapers, including sportsmanship, the French press notes.
The tribal art museum on the Quai Branly Avenue in Paris, which was founded by Chirac, will not collect admission fees for ten days in honour of the former head of state.
The opening of the Pumpkin World has been delayed by the maturation of the pumpkins
Nová Ves u Leštiny (Havlíčkobrodsko) - The farmhouse in Nové Ves u Leština na Havlíčkobrodsko opened the Pumpkin World for more than a month today. Decorations stacked from thousands of freshly harvested pumpkins are dominated by the garden of the massive orange pyramids. The autumn event, which is becoming a tradition, this year starts a week later, because the pumpkin on the surrounding seven hectares of the Pipkovy family's fields have been ripped off for longer. Even more, Jaroslava Pipková told ČTK today.
The Pipk have been growing many types of pumpkins, but the last two years they were not in favor of the weather. This year's harvest has been delayed and some species have not worked out. "We have enough of the orange pumpkins for Halloween as usual, but some species have failed for connoisseurs," Pipková said. Still, it is possible to choose from the farmhouse from already mentioned large pumpkins suitable as well as to carving and puffing decorations through pumpkins for cooking hokaido or oblong "spaghetto" for ornamental nappets of various colours and shapes.
The cultivation of pumpkins is laborious. Farmers use the hand to hoist plants and harvest their fruits, cutting off with scissors from the stint of the pumpkin. The Pumpkin World has been opening to Pipek regularly since 2010, last year's vintages attracted by thousands of people. Pumpkin decorations are complemented by attractions from straw or a log maze. Visitors will also see animals kept from the farm. It will be open daily until November 3.
Details of the event are on the farm's website, where growers also offer some recipes for pumpkin dishes, even pumpkin muffins or juice. Visitors are also told about other options for the pumpkin treatment in the kitchen. "A lot of cooks have their recipes tested, and we get inspired," said Pipková. She noted that some of the housekeeper also loads the pumpkins for sour like cucumbers.
The Stravenka lump sum is planned by the Ministry from 2021. Tax-free is unchanged
The I.M.F. is preparing an amendment to the Income Tax Act, according to which the employee would receive money for the diet directly. According to the I.M.F. one quarter of the employees, i.e. about one million people who do not receive meal vouchers, will reach the support of meals, according to the I.A.
However, according to the chairman of the Association of Voucher System Operators, David Rýc, many small companies that do not have a canteen or meal vouchers provide their employees with meals, for example by importing food or an agreement with restaurants.
"The essence of the intention is that we do not change the tax advantage. Furthermore, it will not pay for health and social insurance," Schiller said on Friday. She added that the limit for the employer's maximum contribution applicable as a tax credit could also be maintained.
The Income Tax Act allows companies to pay a maximum of 55 percent of the price of the meal voucher. The remainder is paid for by employees, in some cases the employer pays them, but already without the tax credit. The most advantageous value of the meal ticket for both employees and employers this year is CZK 123.
Přindiš, Prskavec and Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Championships
Kayakers Vít Přindiš and Jiří Prskavec as well as canoeist Tereza Fišerová safely advanced to the semi-finals of the World Water Slal Championships in Seu d'Urgell. Přindiš was fourth in Friday's qualifying, Prskavec fifth and Fišerová eighth. Three other Czech representatives will be looking to start semi-finals in Spain in the afternoon's corrective qualifying round.
From the strong representative group of kayakers, Vavřinec Hradilek failed, receiving a 50-second penalty at the start of the ride for passing the goal incorrectly. Přindiš and Prskavec, on the other hand, can rest and concentrate on Sunday's semi-final.
"I got the goal of going down the first run to the age of 30, which I did. Not that I didn't care how I turned out, because it starts very early in the morning on Sunday, so I was hoping to be a little higher up to have a better starting position," said Přindiš, praised the comfort in Sea. "Before the patrol race I felt the worst in the 14 days we were here. Then in the race it was good and today better. All the time it's been beautiful, nice races, the spectators came, so fine," he smiled.
Flash was happy, too. "In qualifying, you don't want to make a useless mistake. I didn't really get it in the first few goals. Then I did a great job of the middle, without any problems and I knew I had a mileage, so came the second mistake when I wanted to go down right and I turned my coat around. Overall I can't be dissatisfied. The form is, we will see how it goes on," said this year's overall World Cup winner.
Both representatives praised the fact that they would go to the start on Sunday at the end of the semi-final block. "I'm not a morning bird, it's also cold in the morning, and when you're here for the eighth time, it wants to have a jacket and a sweatshirt," said Přindiš. "It takes an hour and a half to last the semi-finals, which is a pretty good difference in terms of sleep," agreed Flash.
Of the trio of Czech singles singles, only Fišerová succeeded, Eva Říhová finished two places behind the advancing 20-year-old, Kateřina Havlíčková was 35. "I finished the play-off as planned, in the middle arcade I felt like I was running out and not going according to the plan, but I was able to get into the comfort track I wanted to go. I made two pokes and I'm just behind the winner with a clean time. I have a good starting position for the semi-finals," Fišerová said.
Coal will give way to both gas and core. Renewable sources will not cover the increased demand, says European ExxonMobil chief
Renewables will not be enough for the Czech Republic to meet future demand for energy. Due to the unsuitable climate, wind and solar power plants need to be replenished with other alternatives, such as those using natural gas.
In an interview with HN, Philippe Ducom, president of the European branch of the US-based ExxonMobil, one of the global oil drillers, says so in an interview with HN.
Ducom visited the ExxonMobil centre in Prague, with the work of 1,200 people working and tasked with supporting the company's business activities and providing logistics and other services needed for the company's operation.
The Declaration of the Right's End in the House or Jakropak the "right-wing" coalition of ODS, TOP 09, STAN and KDU?
Reports have been appearing in the media and commentaries recently about the upcoming coalition of the parties in question. Many applaud that the "right" is finally coming together, but I am more likely to ask why these parties are still calling themselves right-wing.
As I miss the new Trikolora movement, the Czech Chamber of Deputies no longer has a real right-wing party. And it doesn't matter how the subjects themselves refer to or what denotes parrots the mainstream media. The ODS, in its average, is hardly a central one, the TOP 09 is clearly the party of the city's pseudo-liberal left (which is ashamed of its leftism, and so hypocritically describes itself as conservative or even right-wing). STAN is a party that, by its concept, ideologies and voter-key keying with TOP 09 essentially blends (the reason for its existence is simply not clear to me).
Do you feel that I have taken all of the one stream of the water? No, I am based on the real political actions of these parties. If I consider myself to be a classic liberal right-wing voter, is the highest value for me the freedom of the individual, the free market and minimal interference of the state in the lives of individuals and the economy. How do they fulfill this general assumption of right-wingism by these parties? How many laws slashing people's freedoms are salami-fledged by the salami method, raising taxes, confirming new regulations and growing supervision, increasing the link to the socialist EU or supporting the environmental and gender frenzying in recent years?
I would not be surprised at the Coalition Cooperation of TOP 09, STAN and KDU, on the political map, they simply belong together and, apart from the Christian or, conversely, the homosexualist and gender aspects in them for voters in the sense of the influence of the state on their lives I do not see an obvious difference. However, the ODS has long been portrayed as "the only right-wing" and, by associating with these three entities, it is already openly revealing its true political classification.
By the way, when I briefly mentioned the labels. Have you noticed how often all these parties quite agree and cheaply refer to critics of dirigisme and socialism coming from the European Union as pro-Russian agents? Do they fail or just don't want to understand that there are many people who do not like Eurosocialism and the growing non-freedom of the regime in Russia?
In short, it is possible that in the Czech Republic, other than centrist politics, no longer has a chance of greater success. Perhaps such a merger is what voters really want. Maybe they want a left-of-of-center policy under the cloak of the "right" because they are ashamed of their political beliefs (or they can't even identify it). I don't know. I don't know. But I definitely don't belong among such voters.
Unclouded death of little girl (†8) in Pribram: The culprit is not expected to be punished
Uncloudy cases are called "mistroes" in forensic slang. But they are also investigated if new information emerge years later. Especially when it comes to the death of a child. Criminalist Jiří Markovič was able to investigate the murder of two girls in Prague's Prague Valley in 1980 that time of 12 years. "The 1955 case? This will be difficult, very difficult. It would like to start finding a file, it no longer has to exist, to talk to those who investigated it. Hope is always, but it would be really difficult," Markovič says.
Under the previous regime, the public did not report much about the violent crimes, but according to Markovich, this certainly does not mean that they were being investigated in lax. "It has always been up to specific people," the criminologist thinks. The problem may be that materials from the 1950s may be destroyed, although unclosed cases should not be shredded.
Lucie Bílá's father was not a fan of her at all. You will not believe what she was to do for a living!
Who doesn't know that the national treasure of Lucie Bílá (53) is the original profession of seamstress and real name Hana Zaňáková, probably does not live in the Czech Republic. But the singer herself has now revealed that she almost worked in the glassworks!
Lucie Bílá knew from a relatively early age that she wanted to be a singer. Love for singing was born with her when she performed as a little girl in the cultural house in her hometown of Otvovice, where the warbler still lives.
"And I remember exactly where my mother was sitting. I was born a singer back then," she admitted to Impulsu radio.
But her father was a little worried about his daughter's future, recommending that she follow the path of a trade that has a golden bottom.
"My dad always said, 'Gras girl, craft. Walk your feet on the ground!' He even cajoled me if I didn't want to go to the local glassworks. The glassworks don't work anymore, I kind of do. I'm a trained seamstress and make beads of various rosaries and pendants, which I then auction at auctions and buy wheelchairs for money," she added with a laugh.
The launch of the new toll is not at risk, Kremlin reports. But the operator change is at stake
The Ministry of Transport on Friday started preparations for a new tender for the operation of the new toll system. It is a back-up plan that the state would use in the event that the current toll contract was finally cancelled. In addition, the state is preparing another makeshift solution if it had not completed the tender in time. On Facebook, Transport Minister Vladimír Kremlík (for ANO) said so.
The Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS) on Thursday banned the fulfilment of the toll contract between the state and the consortium CzechToll/SkyToll, with a one-year suspension. The Ministry will file an appeal against this.
"The launch of the new toll collection system is not at risk. Starting today, we are launching a new transparent procurement procedure to the operation of the new toll system, which is now being completed by the consortium CzechToll and SkyToll," the minister said.
The state would thus be looking for the tender for the operator of the currently prepared toll, which will be launched from this December. So it would not be a competition for a completely new toll system, as was the case with the last tender, nor about the use of the old system now operated by Kapsch.
However, according to the Kremlin, the Ministry is also preparing for the fact that it would not be able to prepare the new tender in time. "Based on the experience of the toll tender so far, I am deeply convinced that the OHS is wrong and that within the prescribed period of 12 months it is objectively impossible to prepare and implement such a complex procurement procedure and to hand over the operation of the toll system to the new operator," he said.
In addition to the new procurement procedure, the resort will also prepare a makeshift solution to resolve the toll collection for a transitional period until the state has found a full-fledged form of solution.
The state will thus probably not yet take up the offer submitted to it by the current toll manager Kapsch in recent days. The Austrian firm offered the state to operate the current system in case the toll contract were cancelled.
At the same time, the Kremlin reiterated that he believed a backup plan would not be needed. The ministry will therefore file an appeal against the decision of the antitrust authority.
The Office issued a decision on Thursday in which it prohibited the performance of the toll contract. However, the ban will not take effect until one year after the legal force of the decision of the Office. This is not final and can be filed against it by the chairman of the office. Both the Ministry and CzechToll are therefore continuing to prepare for the new toll, which should be launched in December.
Last year's tender for the new toll system and its operator was won by the consortium CzechToll/SkyToll. It succeeded in the toll tender with an offer of 10.75 billion crowns for a 10-year operation. The current operator Kapsch protested against the course of the tender and the validity of the toll contract, failing to offer over 13 billion crowns in the competition.
I still see myself as a guy who's just getting to know, says Jan Cina
"That was a big school for everyone who worked on it. I fell in love with an afro dance. The way I have something Romani in my dad's, it totally enchanted me," said Jan Cina, who considers himself mainly a musical actor.
Much fresher memories than the First Step series has a part of a painting player in the new film National Class. Cina revealed that director Štěpán Altrichter had to attract him a lot. "It was challenging, but the result is worth it. The film was made a year ago. Hard and honestly, but at the same time entertaining. It was filmed on the National Avenue, where I drove as a non-driver. A lot was also filmed in the South City in Prague," he said of the Czech-German co-production film.
Even though he is nominated for a Thalia Award for a role in the production of The Little Prince, he does not consider it the highlight of his career. "I don't feel that way. I still see myself as a boy who is just getting comfortable. But the nomination is very pleasant and surprising. I can see the peak far ahead of me," he revealed, noting that he didn't even think about the speech of thanks in the event of a victory. "Not even, but not as a child when I listened to the radio discussion shows, I always imagined that, how I speak to people."
Jan Cina has been living with his colleague Petr Vančura for thirteen years. What is his recipe for a happy relationship? "To see each other as a challenge and a good thing to solve," he revealed, reminiscing about the Czech Lions awards when his friend fell on the stairs.
"Yes, it really happened. He had new slippery shoes and the red carpet was slippery too. So it wasn't long before he lay on the ground. He was able to make it a priority. He had a workshop on the Vanchura's stairs, where he taught how to fall down the stairs safely at VIP events."
The zoo in Děčín rejoices in a small macaque
"Our band currently has seven members. Its youngest member came into the world on August 17, gave birth to a female Buffy and is her fifth cub, the father is the male Hitam. For the first days after giving birth, the female carried the cub firmly pressed to her body and did not want to show the world for a long time whether she gave birth to a male or female. At about three weeks of age, the cub has already started to postpone it for a little while, and the nurses have known for a few days that it is a male," zoo spokesperson Alena Houšková said, noting that the KM Zoo had successfully breasted 12 of this species.
Makak's plumstals are the so-called endemic of Sulawesi Island, that is, they do not live in the wild elsewhere in the world. A typical feature is the black fur and plume on the head by which they have a name. Makak plumats live in the rainforests, especially at lower altitudes.
Like most primates, they feed on plant and animal food. The diet is predominantly predominantly the fruits of the forest tree species, which complement the flowers and leaves. They solve the need for protein by eating small arthropods, larvae and, to a lesser extent, the bird's eggs and chicks.
"If we donate the natural enemies, which are pythrees, everything else is written down by a man. Local residents hunt the macaques as a popular prey with tasty meat and for fur.Final for these animals, the burning and felling of the rainforest is fatality," the spokesperson said.
Germany reports the first case of the West Nile fever outbreak from a mosquito on its territory.
In addition to West Nile fever, comai can also carry malaria.
Germany reported the first case on Friday in which a person contracted West Nile fever in German territory after being pinched by an infected mosquito. DPA reported. Until now, all the sick have been infected with the virus while travelling or contacting sick animals. According to experts, the groundbreaking case of the disease is linked to climate change.
The Robert Koch Institute reported that a 70-year-old man from Saxony contracted the virus. The disease was in serious progress and was treated at a hospital in Leipzig due to brain inflammation.
The West Nile fever virus was first demonstrated in 1937 in Uganda. In the meantime, it spread to large parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, and in the 1990s, to the United States. Its carriers are mainly birds and mosquitoes who are infected with their infected blood.
MFMs of state-owned companies are to be newly under way through the selection process. The law will be circumvented, the opposition says
"This is a typical draft law that is unnecessary," said ODS deputy chairman Zbyněk Stanjura.
After several unsuccessful attempts, the Chamber of Deputies has approved changes to prevent opaque distribution of functions in the future - critics speak of tobacconists - in state-owned companies. Newly, applicants should go through the selection process at the ministry and will also be judged by the Government Committee for Personnel Nominations.
However, it is a compromise solution that the ODS, for example, does not like it, because it will reportedly allow ministers to make excuses for the possible poor selection of state managers of the selection committee. Moreover, the opinion of the aforementioned committee for the minister will not be binding. The new one must still be approved by the Senate and signed by President Miloš Zeman.
Přerov: Driver crashed near the village of Kokory: Died wedged in his Fabia
The tragic traffic accident took place on Friday on the straight stretch between Přerov and the village of Kokory. The 28-year-old chauffeur of the fabie failed to manage the drive here and drove off the road. The car overturned on the roof and he remained wedged underneath. He did not survive the suffering injuries.
"According to the initial information found at the scene, a passenger vehicle travelling in the direction of Kokora outside the road went out of communication, where it rolled onto the roof and the driver remained wedged under the vehicle," police spokesperson Miluše Zajícová told news server novinky.cz.
And where are the viewers? The Doha can't be London
At the same time, however, it is a step back, as the journey to Doha, the athletics voluntarily and consciously renuted the riveting atmosphere at the sold-out stadium in London 2017 and the European Championships in Berlin last year.
Giant banners on the walls of the skyscrapers in Doha invite the "greatest sporting event of 2019" to the "greatest sporting event of 2019. However, the fear of how dignified its backdrop will be growing.
"Tickets for the target are sold out for all evenings," the organizers say.
But that's too little.
The upper gallery of the Chalifas Stadium, with a total capacity of 40,000 spectators, is already covered with colourful sails depicting the flags of the 209 participating countries. Athletics has set out in Qatar in a territory where it has no sunken roots despite the annual Diamond League meeting.
So let's not be surprised that only 50,000 tickets were sold for ten days of the Championships last week, although their price started at 60 Qatari's rivals, at a rate of less than 400 crowns.
The organizers have now set themselves the goal of filling the uncovered parts of the stands at least half. That is why, according to the British newspaper's sources, Giuardian, reportedly (albeit the organizers themselves deny this) give away free tickets to migrants who work here as workers, as well as to the children. Which Sebastian Coe, the head of the IAAF Athletics Association, can comment positively on: "We can just now inspire future generations."
The rich Qatar has won the world championships in handball and cycling in the past, after athletics it will be football in 2022. The oil-rich power supply will always be lucrative for the rich sports federations. This is the reality of today's sports world.
But even if we accept it and ignore the absence of fans in the stadium, we can't help but wonder at the fact that the experiment with the first outdoor World Athletes Championships in the Arabian Peninsula should have timed IAAF leaders better - and for a different year. An extremely late term, coined with climate, breaks down the entire pre-Olympic year's season and thus the preparation for a key Olympic season, which would have started for the athletes in October.
Perhaps Qatar will make up for this with technological innovations, with which it promises an ultra-modern and attractive championship. That it is just 37 degrees? Already the area of the stadium is artificially air-conditioned for twenty-four. And the advanced cameras, built up directly in the blocks, are also to be detailed for TV viewers of what takes place in the athletes in the hundreds of seconds before the starter's shot and just after.
Sparta is really packed this year, acknowledges Hradec's back Nedomlel
In his case, the increased motivation is more than understandable. Hradecký hockey defender Richard Nedomlel will go in Friday's match against the club where he recently played. But the former Spartan is convinced that his teammates will be similarly affected, even though they have never dressed for the Prague club's jersey.
"Everyone wants to pull out against Sparta," says the Hradec back before the 5th extra-time match.
In it, Hradec Králové will try to stretch their series of wins, which at the moment is three three-point wins in a row. After Kladno, Pilsen, the fans of the most awarded, Mountfield came to the most awarded on Sunday, Mountfield went for the neighbouring Pardubice.
"But we cannot watch the matches that were. We need to focus on the matches that await us now and play in them the same way, if not better," the Hradec defender points out.
The Hradec should not look back at last year's record with Sparta. They lost in three of their four matches, taking points only once after winning in Prague after extra time. In addition, the Sparta management brought in some significant reinforcements in the summer and expects the team to return to the top.
"Sparta has always had quality players, but what are we going to talk about, they are really busy this year," admits Nedomlel before the first game of the end of this week.
And the other one? Also a nice shift, waiting for Mountfield on Sunday afternoon in the Thirties.
Bloomberg: Venezuela has bitcoins hidden and doesn't know what to do with them
The Central Bank of Venezuela is conducting internal tests to determine whether it can hold cryptocurrencies. It is responding to the direction from the state-owned company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which seeks to send bitcoins and ethers to the central bank, and then to pay the oil company's suppliers with cryptocurrencies. Employees are also studying the proposal to allow the central bank to factor cryptocurrencies into the foreign exchange reserves, which are now close to the 30-year low.
The sanctions that the United States imposed on the authoritarian regime of President Nicolás Maduro largely cut off Venezuela from the global financial system. This further deepened the country's economic crisis. Meanwhile, the current crisis is one of the most serious in comparison, forcing officials to use a mixture of different ways of moving money. While Maduro's efforts to launch the state cryptocurrency as the first in the world to launch the state cryptocurrency, the ongoing efforts to use digital currencies show how desperately the government is trying to find ways to circumvent restrictions.
Neither the Venezuelan central bank nor PDVSA responded to the request for comment.
It is unclear how PDVSA came to its own bitcoin and ethers, nor how much of the value of these currencies it owns. The company has problems obtaining payments from customers with conventional channels, as the big banks are unwilling to trade with the entities subject to sanctions. Last month, the company received most of the payment of $700 million ($16.6 billion) in the yuan in the yuan, because the parties were unable to find financial institutions to enable the transaction.
The PDVSA may not be in the desire to sell cryptocurrencies to the open market because it would require it to register on the stock market and submit to due due diligence. Instead, it wants the cryptocurrency to be used by the central bank and paid with it to the entities to which the PDVSA owes. Oil firm officials believe the central bank is less exposed to any obstacles that could be created by the cryptocurrency payments.
Bitcoins and ethers use a decentralized online ledger known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. In some cases, relatively anonymous transfers are allowed without the need for an intermediary. Few banks are involved in digital currencies because of problems with money laundering and client information that are related to them and complicate compliance with regulations.
The cryptocurrencies after the 2018 debacle are experiencing a return to the spotlight this year thanks to the expectations of their greater reception by the institutions and the Facebook plan to come up with their own cryptocurrency. Even so, they remain unstable. Bitcoin has fallen by almost 20 percent in the last four days, but has a profit of about 130 percent since the start of the year.
Neckermann cancelling all flights, involving five hundred Czech clients
Neckermann cancelling flights in connection with the insolvency of both the British Thomas Cook and his German daughter.
"The Czech company Thomas Cook, s. r. o., acting under the trade name Neckermann Travel Agency, did not file the insolvency petition," Šrámek said in a press release.
"CK Neckermann, however, is forced to continue to cancel the planned departures of its clients," he added, noting that this currently covers all departures from 26 September to 6 October.
According to Šrámek, the cancellation of flights will affect some 500 clients. The 800 Neckermann clients, who are abroad at the moment, according to him, will "will be taken care of and their safe return to the Czech Republic by their scheduled flight" is assured.
The travel agency admitted that some clients were asked to pay for their stay. "In such a case, it is necessary for the clients to contact the CK Neckermann SOS line immediately," added Šrámek.
Thomas Cook's collapse took place on Monday, with a travel agent entering into a deal in August this year, on the basis of which creditors were to inject £900 million into the company.
It was to receive half of the sum from the Chinese firm Fosun Tourism. It was to become the majority owner on the basis of this. The other half was to be provided by bondholders and creditor bank holders. However, information surfaced as early as September 20 that creditors demanded that the traveler obtain a £200 million reserve, otherwise the deal was falling. On Monday, the company announced that it had failed.
Under the bridge, a non-confrontational homeless woman was killed.
According to the Prague police, the murder took place sometime during the evening until the night from Tuesday to Wednesday. It is to this time that the police appeal to possible testimony relates.
"Some of the drivers who were driving on the bridge connecting Libeň and Žižkov or the street Pod Krejcákem could have filmed the killer on the onboard camera, for example. A witness could perhaps only see him and could describe him. In short, we will welcome any testimony to this case and receive him on line 158," said the spokesman of the regional police directorate Jan Daněk.
According to the spokesman for Daněk, the murdered homeless woman was non-confrontational, did not drink alcohol and sought out the company of other people. The woman lived at the scene. "She most often moved around Krejcárk, Palmovka and Holešovice, when she had large blue shopping bags with her," added Daněk, a description of the victim, who could also help potential witnesses.
Slovaks succeed, only to pay a fine for racist insults
The Slovak Football Association succeeded in appealing against the closure of the stadium for the racism of the fans. The national team was originally without spectators to play a European Championship qualifier with Wales, instead the union will now only pay a fine of 15 thousand euros (about $387,000).
The UEFA disciplinary committee punished Slovakia and Hungary for the behaviour of the fans at the recent mutual qualifying match in Budapest, which were won 2-1 by the visiting charges of Czech coach Pavel Hapal. The stadium closed to both unions for one match and fined Slovakia €20,000, Hungary €67,000.
The Slovaks were only fined €15,000 for the insulting political chanting after the appeal. The national team's closest match in qualifying for the European Championship with Wales on 10 October in Trnava will be made available to the fans.
Basketball players failed to reach the medal of the Under-17 Championship, finishing fourth
The third World Cup of 17 was won by the Americans, who beat Spain just 77-75 in the final despite 40 points from Spain's Angela Salvadores.
"We really wanted to win and not be potato, but maybe we wanted it too much. We caught the start, but we couldn't keep up because they rolled us under the basket," regretted captain Karolína Malečková. "Plaeling in front of such an audience was an unreal experience," she praised fans in Klatovy and Pilsen.
The Czechs started very well, took an 8-0 lead thanks to two 3-pointers and dominated the field for the entire first quarter. At that point, it seemed that they would repay their opponents' defeat in the 85-88 group stage after extra time. But the referees whistled 15 fouls at half-time and helped Hungary back into the game with a 12-2 draw with contentious decisions.
"I'm convinced that all I have to do was score two or three more baskets, run to 20 points and we wouldn't let it go. But instead, our mistakes came. I'm not interested in the referees, but what we did wrong, and there were mistakes that helped the opponent get caught up," said coach Richard Fousek.
"It wasn't the first time we had a lapwit as a concentration lapel. But the girls are fighters, they didn't release anything and they fought to the end. But the opponent was of a lot of quality," he added.
The Czechs were particularly held in the game by Petr Holešínská with accurate long-distance shooting and pivotka Tereza Šípová. However, the top Czech striker had a problem with foul play and a large part of the third quarter was absent from the pitch. The Hungarians took advantage of this and gained a slight lead, which they had already held even though the Czechs fought until the last seconds.
"For us the first five games it was very challenging, we turned the games in a tight rotation and it cost us a lot of strength. You could see already against Spain that the girls were tired and there was nowhere to take. Because of our physique we were not consistent in defence. We didn't play a quick counter-attack, we missed the rebound. And the Hungarians are of such quality that when you don't get everything together, you can hardly win," added Fousek.
He believes that his charges have a promising future. "In two years, the girls have managed to win the Youth Olympics, to be second at the European Championships of the 16-year-old and now they are fourth in the world. For our standards, it is a quality team with a good character and to continue to work with it and develop talent. Now it is up to the federation, which coach will be assigned to them in the higher categories," Fousek added.
The end of political tobacconists? The new law, according to critics, will not help anyway!
But according to some opposition MPs, the law is more likely to play into depriving ministers of responsibility for the election while continuing to select their candidates.
Greater transparency in the selection procedures for posts in state-owned companies - this is one of the objectives of the nomination law. 119 deputies were in favour. The law was passed, for example, thanks to the votes of ANO, the KSČM, the Social Democrats and even the Pirates.
Candidates for state-owned companies will have to go through the selection process before the government committee. For example, it was the Pirates who sought to make the recommendation to the minister binding.
The Civic Democrats and the SPD movement fear that the nomination law will play into the hands of ministers. "Newly, the minister will be able to hide behind some of the commission's decisions and will not have a clear transparent responsibility," SPD chairman Tomio Okamura thinks. ODS Vice-President Martin Kupka is also speaking.
The government committee should completely reject candidates who do not meet the conditions. These will include criminal integrity, debt-free, minimum age of 25, and expertise should also be the main selection criterion.
The bill will still have to go through the Senate, and then the president will get it signed.
Heavy competition for the Skoda Kamiq. Kia XCeed is betting on a rich outfit, at what cost?
The Kia XCeed is a relatively difficult-to-commeritable model. It is clearly among the compact SUVs, but it does not offer all-wheel drive. This item leaves it to the larger Sportage sibling, which is as direct to cars like the Skoda Karoq, the Opel Grandland X or the Volkswagen Tiguedan. Compared to them, the XCeed also bets on the more dynamic bodywork shapes, which sloping the back can vistantly recall the world of SUV-coupe, popular in this part of the market especially among the premium Audi, BMW or Mercedes-Benz brands.
On the other hand, you can't just rank the XCeed alongside the oplastic versions of classic compacts, which include the Ford Focus Active. Compared to him, the Koreans have made a much larger number of changes to the bodywork, so who doesn't need to see the Ceed in the shape of the news.
Unlike a compact hatchback or a Ceed estate, the XCeed is also offered exclusively with turbocharged engines, so don't expect a basic atmospheric 14-cylinder. The XCeed starts with a turbocharged litre and also offers a supercharged 16-cylinder with 150 kW, reserved for the GT siblings. Here, the sporty stage is not expected. Turbodiesels 1.6 CRDi is only offered in a mild-hybrid version, that means that the combustion engine is assisted by the electric system, which helps with reducing consumption and emissions. From 100 kW, it is also possible to pay for the seven-speed dual-speed automatic.
Soon the range will grow with a plug-in hybrid, a variant that drives about six tens of kilometres just for electricity. The batteries can then be charged from a normal socket as well.
Simona Krain: Fuck the Age! Then she kissed Lucia Bílá!
The day before the christening of the Fuck The Age calendar (M*dat age) Simona Krainová posted her latest photos of herself completely naked! "I was a bit afraid of people condemning me to take naked at my age. I'm a rather shy person. But I only have positive reactions so far. I wanted to show women that when you want to, it's still possible to have a solid figure at 46. Of course, there's a hard work and recolleation, but there's no other way to do it."
"We took about three thousand pictures with Lukáš Dvořák, selected about a hundred and there are twelve of them in the calendar, so the rest is still waiting for their moment. It's certainly not the last time I'm naked," confided the model, who even came to her baptism very exposed.
She had an extended jacket from Bernhardt and shorts underneath, but they couldn't be seen, so it looked like she had forgotten the bottom. A day-to-day jogging tightened her legs, so she can afford similar models.
Simona was so pleased with her success that she kissed everyone she met at the christening. A husband, friends, even Slavice, and Lucie Bílá.
Caronie brought voice of a digital soul
All you know about obesity is wrong, it is the headline of a long text written for the Huffington Post by Michael Hobbes and photographed by Finlay Mackay. In a provocative illumination, it is then written that the medical community has for decades ignored the facts of obesity and waged a fierce (and also unnecessary) war against overweight people who not only marked public opinion but also destroyed a lot of lives. But now is the time for a new paradigm.
What Hobbes says at the outset is that there is often a very long and tedious journey from knowing and knowing and knowing the facts to putting into practice. He mentions the case of scorching, when some captains already in the seventeenth century handed out lemons, lime, and oranges with the belief that they would prevent the disease from being so pre-drilled. However, the British Navy's navy resigned from this practice because of concerns about heightened costs. A clear influence of the fruit in the prevention and treatment of the disease was then proved in the mid-18th century, but it took another fifty years for the navy to be taken into account.
"Every public health discovery - and no matter how significant it was - has always had to compete with traditions, prejudices and financial stimuli within the society to which it was to be implemented," writes Hobbes. In American society, nearly 80 percent of the adult population and around one-third of children now meet the definition of overweight or obesity. More Americans now live with obesity than with breast cancer, Alzheimer, Parkinson and HIV combined.
Meanwhile, obesity is seen as a supremely personal failure of an individual who is claimed to be burdening the health service and reducing GDP. Fear of fatness is so great in the population that Americans now spend more money on diets than they spend on computer games and movies. The truth is, however, that diets don't work. As early as 1959, research showed that 95 to 98% of attempts to lose weight by failing, and two-thirds of people on the diet subsequently gain more than they lost.
Armed with statistics, Hobbes also describes the lifestyle and traumas of overweight people. Personal meets the systemic encounter, with, for example, in faculties at the faculties in teaching future doctors, devote herself to nutrition issues of just 19 hours from the entire study. Which is when the 60 process of calories received by the Americans come from ultra-processed food - that is, over-processed food.
The way obesity is stigmatized is illustrated in the news from surgeries, where overweight people usually experience shorter examinations, doctors approach them with less empathy and view them as more problematic patients.
But overweight is far from being an American problem, as Hobbes writes, since 1980 the share of obesity in 73 countries around the world has doubled and increased in 113. And in that time, no country has managed to shrink and stop the increase. Absolutely none.
Brno Grand Prix? Ticket prices imminent
The most expensive item a year before the Grand Prix is the parking fee. This year, it was about one hundred and fifteen million crowns. "The pool of people who come to Brno at the Grand Prix spend money on accommodation, food or entertainment, which should more or less offset the costs associated with the organisation of the event, including the leisure fee," assessed economist Petr Pelc.
According to him, the importance of the plant is also in attracting tourists to the city. "Brno does not have as many of the world's tourist attractions. The Grand Prix attracts visitors there and from abroad. For Brno, it is important as important as, for example, the tuřanské airport or the fairgrounds. And these are projects that support public money," the economist added.
Grand Prix in Brno
- costs for the past five years: CZK 686 million
- profits from the past five years: CZK 682 million
- problem: lack of money for hosting, increasing fitting fee for Dorna promoter company
- possible solutions: more money from the state, use of advertising space, increase in ticket prices
- state of play: Negotiations for a new contract to host races for the next five years
According to the director of the Institute of Public Administration, Filip Hrůza, the organizers must now evaluate whether the race is advantageous for Brno. "The Grand Prix is drainning money from public budgets for other matters. But to some extent, this is a political and not an economic issue," he thinks.
In the future, the cost of a motorsport event can be even higher. In the game, the option of increasing the breee per-soup fee is almost double.
"The situation is not closed, we must try to negotiate the best possible conditions with Dorna. It also depends on the extent to which the state is ready to contribute to the organisation of the race. Should the worst-case scenario be fulfilled, I am afraid that it is not realistic for the city and the county to pay the amount," admitted Brno Mayor Markéta Vaňková.
As the daily Equality has already reported, representatives of the South Moravian Region and Brno, because of the difficulties in raising money for the Grand Prix, are also discussing the possibility of using advertising. "The condition of Dorna is that the advertisement must be placed in places that are not taken by cameras. The selection of companies is also limited, because if Dorna has a general sponsor, then a company from the same area cannot be the second sponsor," explained Vankova.
The organizers can also get more money from the tickets in the coming years. "We have to sit down and tell what the costs will actually be. And we have to adjust the overvaluation of the tickets," said the opposition ANO representative and former mayor Petr Vokřál.
D5 accident: Highway closed with truck crash
The incident was reported at about 08:00 at the 22nd kilometer in the direction of Prague. "The highway is closed, at least for the freight traffic. Passenger cars can go through the gas station," police spokesperson Michaela Richterová said in the morning. Traffic was restored around 2:30 p.m. According to Richter, the preliminary damage is at least two million crowns, the cause of the accident officers are investigating.
Central Bohemian firefighters' spokesman Petr Svoboda said that one truck was transporting passenger vehicles and the other with a plastic granulate. "Due to the big impact, the vehicles transported were moved, which firefighters had to first arrange against a possible crash," he added.
One of the cars had a damaged fuel tank, from which about 200 litres of diesel leaked. Another 200 litres were drained by the firefighters. The accident was called to the accident by the workers of the environment department of the Beroun City Council. The release of the crashed vehicles and the freeway was cleared by a private company, which also extracted contaminated soil.
Failed qualification. Czech athletes are not doing well in Doha so far
The World Championships in Doha began with qualifying failes for Czech athletics. Diana Mezuliáníková dropped out in the 800 metres and the qualification was not passed by the pole-year-old Romana Maláčová or the hammer player Kateřina Šafránková, who defended the eighth place she had surprised in London the previous year.
The run on Friday will be attended by hurdler Vít Müller and the night marathon race will be run by Marcela Joglová.
Safrankova threw 65.46 metres with her third attempt and fell almost six metres short of her best this year, which she would have had to improve on the progress. Maláčová jumped 435 cm, 450 cm was already above her strength. To participate in the final it was necessary to climb the 460 cm limit.
Meszuliáníková, who reached the championship at the last minute thanks to an invitation from the IAAF International Federation, finished in the fourth heatshome in the penultimate sixth place and even a time of 2:03.48 minutes was not enough for her progress to the semi-finals. She fell short of her best this year. "It was quite quick for me, unfortunately I was fighting with my opponent in the bend, which quite took me for the strength. I felt that I still had the strength, but it slowed me down there. I almost stopped by it and had to start again, so it was a bit unpleasant in this one.
She was glad to have overtaken at least one opponent at the finish line. "She really wasn't well, so every defeated opponent was good. But I think it was for the fifth place. Unfortunately," she said. The fastest half-back in the heats was Winnie Nanyond of Uganda in the heats in 2:00.36.
In Doha, the best eight-hundred-year-old of recent years, Caster Semenya of South Africa, who has too high testosterone levels in her body, is missing, but, like some other runners, is refusing the treatment ordered by IAAF rules from this year.
In the 100 metres heats, the number one favourite, American Christian Coleman, who with a time of 9.98 was the only one to be below the ten-second mark. His compatriot Justin Gatlin, who is seeking to defend his title at the age of 37, also advanced to the semi-finals. Nigeria's Divine Oduduru, who is the top of the year's 9.86 doubles standings, was expected to take the semifinals and expected to contest Coleman, who is 9.81 this season.
He showed great form in the qualifying of distance runners Cuban Juan Miguel Echevarría, who flew to a distance of 840 cm with the first jump. No athlete in the World Cup qualifying for the past 20 years jumped so far. The 21-year-old Cuban leads this year's table with an output of 865 cm.
French Oscar Les Misérable's Candidate to Launch Festival Be2Can
The Golden Bear and both winners of the acting awards from this year's Berlinale, the Cannes Jury and Jury Prize and much more will be presented by the 6th year of the festival film from Berlin, Venice and Cannes. This year, the Be2Can festival will also bring a selection of the most remarkable and the most pro-connapported events presented by the competitions of the three most important European film festivals.
The opening film of this year's festival will be the French drama Les Misérables, for which the author of the film Ladj Ly took the Jury Prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival. The film is a French Oscar candidate. The pre-premiere of the film in Prague will be presented by the two main roles of criminal unit police officers, actors Alexis Manenti and Djibril Zonga. Alexis Manenti is also co-author of the film's screenplay.
Be2Can will take place in Prague's Lucerna and Edison Filmhub cinemas in Prague, as well as in Brno (Art kino), Ostrava (Minikino) and in Zlín (Golden Apple Cinema) from 2 to 8 October.
The director Ladj Ly's directorial feature debut was released and awarded at a number of other world festivals after his success at Cannes. At the Durban IFF, he won the Best Film and Best Screenplay Award, as well as the IFF in Zurich, Shanghai, Munich, Melbourne, Sarajevo and will soon be shown in San Sebastián.
As part of the festival, however, viewers can also look forward to the films Synonyms, Young Ahmed, The Inner of the System, Goodbye, My Son, Pardon, We did not catch up with you, The Anthology of the City of Ghosts and the film At Golden Gloves. But they can also enjoy other fresh news from this year's Venice, which will head to Czech distribution: s-ci-fi Ad Astra, Joker, the Czech triumph of the First-Towed Birds.
Which cities will disappear under the sea?
The vote of the upper house of the Canadian Parliament has confirmed a well-known rumour for days: Canada has taken honorary citizenship from the former legend of the fight for human rights, Nobel Peace Prize winner Do Aung San Suu Kyi. The current leader of Myanmar (Barmany), who spent years under house arrest for her country to bring freedom to her country, lost her honorary title to her participation in the genocide of the Rohingya minority.
The decision to take honorary citizenship was approved by the lower national legislature a week ago, and the senators have now unanimously endorsed it. "It's the right message for both her and Myanmar and the world," commented the decision of her colleagues, the independent senator Ratna Omidvar. "We must make it clear that the co-conspirators of the genocide are not welcome here in Canada - all the more as honest citizens."
The verdict of the Canadian Parliament does not technically change anything for Suu Kyi, it is only an honorary title, but on a symbolic level it is a strong message for her. The silence of a longtime human rights activist to the atrocities that the army of the majority-Buddhist Myanmar has been committing for endless months on the Rohingya Muslim minority is unbearable.
The fact that there is an officially organised genocide in Myanmar, and that Suu Kyi - the de facto prime minister of the country's government - has completely failed in the obligation to protect her citizens, was recently brought to the attention of a UN report. Specifically, it mentions the names of several army commanders, who, according to the investigating team, should stand trial for the crimes against humanity committed in actions that - the report says - "shock both through the intrusion of their actions and the huge scope." Su Kyi and its leading administration, according to the United Nations, were committing complicity, primarily by covering up and launching the soldiers' actions around the protection of the fogwl.
After the scrapped Suu Kyi, five figures remain on the list of honorary citizens of Canada: Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, Nelson Mandela, Tändzin Gjamccho, 14th Dalai Lama, Karim Aga Khan IV, 499th Imams of Shiite Muslims and Malal Yussufzai.
The developments surrounding the former icon of the fight for freedom and democracy were also reflected in the Canadian Museum of Human Rights, where information was added to the profile of Suu Kyi about the atrocities against the Rohingya and the parliamentary decision to take her title as an honorary citizen. "We also dampened the illumination of her photos on a tablu on a tablure showing the timed axis of the fight for human rights and thinking of replacing her face with a portrait of a member of the Rohingya minority," the museum's spokesman, Rorie McLod, as saying.
The only thing that will remain so in the current upheaval of Suu Kyi - at least for now - is the Nobel Peace Prize, awarded to her at the suggestion of Václav Havel in 1991 for a huge contribution to the fight for democracy. "Although Mrs Suu Kyi's current actions are regrettable, her awards will not be annulled," said the head of the Nobel's Lars Heikensten, the Nobel Foundation, to CBS Canada.
Microplastics have reached the human gut, a study confirmed for the first time
Scientists have been confirmed by several years of suspicions. The team, led by University of Vienna professor Philippe Schwabl, published a study that first proves the presence of microplastics in the human stool. Although the study is small, with eight participants from Europe, Japan and Russia - however, in samples of all the people surveyed, small pieces of plastic were found with dimensions of between 50 and 500 micrometres. None of the eight subjects were vegetarian, six of whom did not avoid marine fish, all drank plastic water and food bottled in plastic.
And it would actually be a bit of a miracle if nothing was found. We already know that microplastics - which are either made directly, for example for the needs of the cosmetics industry, or are formed by the breakdown of larger pieces - are present in marine animals, insects, tap water and lemonades; in short, everywhere on the planet. Their entry into the digestive tract of man is only officially confirmed. There were roughly 20 particles of microplastics per ten grams of stool, and scientists estimate that they will have more than half of the world's population.
Of course, both layman's and scientific knowledge suspects that this is not a good thing. However, humanity still doesn't know how bad it is - and the effect microplastics have on "host" organisms. Small particles can get into the bloodstream or the lymphatic system and end up in the liver, for example. "This is the first study of its kind ever and confirmed what we have thought for a long time. Now that we have the first evidence of microplastics in the human body, we must continue to investigate exactly what this means for human health," says Schwabl.
So far, microplastics in the gut are known to have a negative impact on the immune responses of the digestive system, thereby facilitating the absorption of poisonous chemicals and other pathogens to the body. And there is no known idea yet to reduce the use of plastics, especially polypropylene. This will be difficult, however - the first task faced before the governments and the authorities will at least stop its steep increase. Just as far as plastic bottles are concerned, experts estimate that in three years, humanity consumes a fifth more than it does today. The current pace is a riveting million-dollar binders per minute. Each year, in the sea, the environment of the environment is threatened by the arrams.
Some states have already moved to reduce and other measures, Kenya, for example - under threat of draconian punishments - banned plastic bags. The European Commission is considering small bans (well-known straws), with the domestic Ministry of the Environment heading in the same direction. Critics, however, argue that such measures are pretty but totally inadequate.
Harry in the footsteps of Princess Diana (†36)! Where is Meghan?
Diana was exceptional in that she could grab people's hearts. In January 1997, she stirred up a stir when she visited Africa and especially the minefield. The films she wore a protective suit and a shield on her face became iconic. And that, even then, no one could have guessed that a few months later, the princess of the human hearts would breathe in a tragic car accident in Paris.
Now her younger son Harry scored a score when he went to the same place as her after 22 years. He went to the mine removal post in Angola, Angola, as well as putting on a special protective suit while looking very thoughtful. He certainly couldn't help remembering his beloved mother, who he lost at just 13.
Harry had a speech on the spot where he praised the efforts of the Halo Trust, which is working to neutralize the minefields and other explosives in the countries where the war took place. "The minefields are unhealed wounds of the war. By cleaning them, we can help the community to find peace with which to come and occasion," he said, also appealing to the rescue and retention of wilderness and the local river as a source of water. After this visit, the Duke of Sussex moved to Huamba to rename the local orthopedic orthopaedic center after his famous mother, Princess Diana.
He did not forget to mention it on the official Instagram account: "The Duke is honored to visit a place and a community that was so important to his mother, to get acquainted with their tireless mission and to speak to everyone she (Diana) felt that they most needed to be heard, even though the problem was not popular worldwide," appeared in a post on the Sussex Royal instagram.
But it may be a cholus to the royal fans that he has not taken his wife, Meghan (38) and their son Archie (4 months, to such an expedition to remembering Diana). Both have had a separate schedule for Harry since Wednesday, apparently for their protection. After all, taking a small baby to the minefield, he doesn't sound very safe, and Harry doesn't want to threaten his beloved family at any price.
Individ-chants. We don't have a reproduction for sure, but we don't have to scare
Some words have ore connotations, although they just tell the state of affairs. They include the word only of an only child. It refers to a child growing up without siblings, but they do not sound neutral. "You know, only to be told," it says, without anything to be said. Interestingly, this trait bears the "one-inch" in an indisquish time, even from a time when expressions such as demographic crisis were widely used.
Today, even people outside the scientific community know that a fertility rate of 2.1 per woman is required to ensure the simple reproduction of the population. It is also widely known that no state achieves this value in Europe today. At most, France or Sweden are approaching it, but the simple level of reproduction of the population is not assured by European states. (Within the West, only Israel is out of line with the aggregate fertility of 3.1 children per woman.) It is a situation like a made-up for alarmism. Therefore, it is no surprise when it also falls for the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, Maláčová: "The only-units are almost as old as the two-cadre family," she said in an interview.
Yes, it is a good thing when the problem is pointed out instead of downplayed or ideologized. Like in Germany, where the campaign for more children easily obtains the label of fascism (in the style of "so supported by Hitler"). It is a good thing to be reminded that many couples plan only children directly. It is a good thing if politicians show the will to remove the obstacles that lead to those decisions (perhaps the weak expansion of work from taking women's homes away from further pregnancies). But look it all up to one thing.
If Minister Maláčová says that "there are almost so many people already," there is a drop of demagoguery. The statement was appropriate twenty years ago. Let's remember that fertility in the Czech Republic was last provided with a simple reproduction in 1980 ("Husák's children"). Then it declined to a formidable 1.14 in 2000. But since then it has risen by almost fifty percent, to the current 1.70 children per woman, which is the European above-average. It is not enough for a simple reproduction yet, so the activity of politicians is appropriate. Only with the alarmism can they take a little less.
Costa Rica is the champion in the fight against climate change
Costa Rica was awarded the title for several reasons. To start with a plan to be carbon neutral by 2050 - however, a lot of countries have committed to this as part of the Paris Agreement. The Central American state with a population of around five million produces only 0.4 percent of the world's emissions. Costa Rica has also pledged to fully switch to renewable energy sources by 2030, with 70 percent of taxi or taxi trucks expected to run on electricity.
The official tourist organization says that already around 95 percent of the energy comes from renewable sources - in 2017, Costa Rica operated for a total of 300 days.
Costa Rica boasts nearly 30 national parks.
The density of afforestation also contributes to the reduction of emissions. Rain forests with the diverse fauna and flora, which cover more than half of the country's territory, are also one of the main tourist draws. "The Costaka is a pioneer in the field of nature conservation and gives an example to other states in the region, but also around the world. Climate change requires urgent action from all of us," the UN said in a statement.
Costa Rica can boast nearly 30 national parks, which is a lot, given the country's small size (51,100 square kilometers), a lot. Rainforest or misty forests, coral reefs or mangroves are home to five percent of the world's biodiversity. The country also has volcanoes, pitse waterfalls, and you would also find several safety centres for lenomethings.
In Prague, the Scientists' Night begins
"In Prague, I would definitely visit the Czech Technical University and look at the model of what smart cities will look like. At Charles University, I would visit the Institute of Anatomy at the Medical Faculty, to which there is no access for the public at other times," advises Jitřenka Navrátilová, the National Coordinator of Scientists' Noci Jitřenka Navrátilová.
The Institute of Anatomy offers a tour of the autopsy room and the opportunity to try out the work with surgical instruments.
"Then I would run to ČZU and watch the film Green Desert," adds Navratilova. Nine laboratories will also offer the guided tours. The slogan for this year's Scientists' Night is "furly to the planet."
Attorney General reinstated prosecution of mother who manipulated daughter against father
Attorney General Pavel Zeman disagrees with the acquittal of her mother, who has long manipulated her daughter and disrupted her relationship with her father. She was facing charges of abuse and endangering custody. The district court acquitted her of the indictment, Zeman disagrees. In a similar conduct, according to his appeal to the Supreme Court, a crime can be seen.
The Supreme Court's decision could have a broader impact on other cases. "A more specific definition of such a specific form of abuse can be considered necessary in terms of directing further application practice," according to Zeman's appeal.
The Svitavy District Court first found the woman guilty last year of abusing a person in charge as well as endangering the upbringing of a child. She and her daughter created a firm, even in a situation in which she should have been entrusted with her father.
The result was a pathological fixation on the mother and a significantly negative relationship with the father. The situation was marked by the emotional development of the daughter, who was even hospitalized. She threatened to be self-hated if transferred to the care of her father.
The Svitav court sentenced the mother to two years in prison with a two-year suspended conditional suspension. However, the Pardubice branch of the regional court acquitted the woman on appeal, it is not a criminal offence. The same verdict was repeated by the regional court even after the Supreme Court had already ordered him to decide again.
The regional court found that situations where one parent is manipulating a child against another are not exceptional. It is dealt with in guardianship proceedings, possibly with the help of psychologists or social protection authorities of youth. Only exceptionally, criminal law is the solution.
According to the Attorney General, however, the woman committed both abuse and endangering her upbringing. "The accused was quite targeted when she aroused negative feelings about her father in her daughter, and purposefully affirted these negative emotions. By doing so, she not only pursued the illegal intention to limit or rule out the contact of her father's intercourse with the minor, but she must have been aware that by this, the minor would provoke negative consequences in the psychosocial sphere," according to the appeal.
Zeman asked the Supreme Court to refer the case back to the regional court once more. The appeal shows that the child is now in the care of the father.
Dersch, he called on Schiller for words about the opposition scum Czernin
"I find it completely unacceptable for a member of the Czech government to use such a totalitarian statement anywhere, much less on the floor of parliament," Czernin wrote in an open letter to Schiller.
Her words aroused a stir in the discussion of the draft constitutional action against President Miloš Zeman. The opposition did not get enough votes and the draft constitutional action that the Senate came up with was thrown off the table by the MPs.
"I get dozens of messages from people I don't know. There's not a single vote in support of this lawsuit. There are messages in support of the president and messages like spending taxpayers' money here, hitting empty straw. And I even dare, I don't use hard terms, one of them to quote: It's an opposition and senatorial scum," the Chancellor of the Exchedula said.
"These terms were used by the Nazis to the citizens of Jewish origin and the Communists to their political opponents. It is the rhetoric of the totalitarian, without a hiccup with respect for man and to take sides with the current First Vice-President, TOP Tzernin, who will compete with the current First Vice-President Markéta Pekarová Adamová in the autumn.
"I was quoofed by one of the many reports I received dozens of in the course of the House proceedings. Their common denominator was the disgust at the constant personal defamation we are witnessing in domestic politics on a daily basis and which was also the main motive for Thursday's proceedings of the House. The fact that the term is covered by the term surprises me," Schillerová responded to the Czech News Agency.
Destroyed shops, fires in the streets, a memorial procession accompanied by riots
Five years ago, 43 students at the University of Ayotzinapa disappeared, despite extensive investigations, the case has not yet been cleared up. Supposedly, the students were to be detained by police in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It is not clear exactly what happened after that, but according to the investigation, the students apparently ended up in the hands of the local syndicate and were subsequently killed and burned, reports the APTN.
A memorial procession was held in Mexico's capital city on Thursday, with families wanting to express their frustration that they still fail to find answers and explain the disappearance of their children.
But the most-sin-quiet march was disrupted by smaller groups of vandals, destroying everything in their way. Vandals were destroying shops and hotels, not destruating sights, setting fires around the city and discharging windows.
Even before the march, President Andres Manuel López Obrador said he would do everything to catch up and asked the public for any information that would lead to the case being clarified.
Over 142 people were detained as part of the investigation, but neither of them were convicted. Many of them had to be released because their human rights were violated, investigators allegedly had to torture the suspects, APTN reports.
Mahulena Bochanova interrupted the year-long detox and is sinning again!
More than a year ago, Mahulena Bochan confided in Lightning that she had quit alcohol. "On holidays, I told myself that I would give my old-fashioned 50-year-old's body a breath to my old 50-year-old body. I felt a period of time forever. I feel so relaxed, I have a lot of energy, I have improved my psyche and my psyche has improved. I've been mentally unwell, my head doesn't feel like it, I have more energy, money."
The annual abstinence is said to have been enough and the actress found her way to alcohol again. "Sometimes I have bubbles or quality wine, but I don't drink what I used to do. I have one drink and have fun until morning. I have a bottle of wine in the fridge for a week. I also enjoyed a non-alcoholic beer, which I can drink at any time," boasts Mahulena, who still makes up a couple with the Brno businessman Petr.
Bočanová also returned to the theatrical season after the holidays and will newly enter the series Ordinace v růžové zahradě. "I am ashamed of the first two performances, I was really bad, I was overturing out. But it's getting better," the actress smiles critically.
Jaromír Soukup spoke about Gott: He is mainly at peace
Moderator and entrepreneur Jaromír Soukup (50) will not be berserk at any questions. On his show Call and Write to the Boss, he publicly comments on various topics. Nor is he strangers to the tabloid caucuses he glosses about, sparkly and wittily glossing about it.
Jaromír Soukup commented on the sad news, which is a very serious illness of Karel Gott. He promised the singer one very considerate thing for himself.
"You know, Karl got sick and said it fair, without having to dig it down somewhere by tabloid journalists. I don't want to comment on it, it's a serious illness, we all respect Karel Gott immensely. And I would like him of course successful treatment and peace of mind! The calm he needs now," said the owner of Barrandov TV.
"I would like the media to let him be alone. And wait for the news that the Master himself chooses to give to the media. I don't even much like the various comments that his old acquaintances and various celebrities think of his health. And on behalf of our media, I can say that we will only address his illness and his person if he or she is interested in it himself. To me, a similar approach should be considered by the other media."
Young Czechs think they know how to do it with money. The survey did not confirm this
"It turns out, then, that young Czechs have a somewhat greater trust in their knowledge of finances than the reality. Women and respondents without a high-end share of the wrong answers in this case were due to women and respondents without a high school diploma," said Jaroslava Palendalová, director of KRUK.
It is more likely that men and young high school students or college students believe in their knowledge of financial products.
Young Czechs learn the most about the functioning of financial matters from their parents (37 percent), self-study on the internet (23 percent) and only in the third season from school teaching (21 percent).
Questions around finance are mainly consulted with women, while information online is more likely to be sought by men. Retrieves of information about finances from their parents predominates in all age categories of young people, regardless of their educational attainment or personal income. Practically minimal influence, the prospectuses of financial institutions, journals and publications have a minimal impact.
"Once again, the importance of raising children by their parents, who represent authority in all the main areas of life, is proving to be crucial. That is why the level of financial literacy of parents who transfer their knowledge and experience to their offspring is key," Palendalová said.
Savings and investments are preferred by 94 per cent of young people.
Young people are unequivocally concerned with the question of whether it is better to save and buy their own house or apartment, for example, or to enjoy and spend the money, without saving and living their own.
The strategy of saving and investing in the long-term tangible property is espoused by 94 percent of those surveyed. This is true across all age categories of young people, regardless of educational attainment, social status or current personal income.
The strategy of the investigation is then 100% espouse by people in a marital union with two or more children and employees in the public sector. On the contrary, people living alone and with an income above 30,000 crowns a month want to enjoy themselves.
Hunter injured in fall from sitting, carrying him to the ambulance for three hours
The unfortunate accident took place before 7:30 p.m. in the top parts at the Devil's Mill.
"It was a very complex and inaccessible terrain, so we dispatched five of our rescuers with the proper technology to the injured man. At the same time, we asked for cooperation with the Moravian-Silesian Region Medical Rescue Service. Paramedics then dispatched an ambulance to the accident," described the circumstances of the intervention Libor Kluz, the dispatcher of the Mountain Rescue Service of Beskydy.
Rescuers found the hunter in the targeted location with multiple injuries. They immediately treated him and then gently, but with difficulty transporting the so-called Austrian trolley through the impassable terrain.
"Transport in the route of about one and a half kilometres was slow and difficult. The injured nimrod was therefore handed over to the crew of the ambulance car after approximately three hours," added Libor Kluz.
According to Radan Jaškovský, the commissioned chief of the Mountain Rescue Service of Beskydy and the intervening rescuer, a fellow hunter was fortunately able to describe in detail the whereabouts of the injured.
"We therefore found it relatively quickly. However, if he had the Rescue app on his phone, our rescuers would have been with him sooner and at the same time the dispatcher of line 155 would have known about the accident and his situation," commented Radan Jaškovský.
He added that a charged mobile phone with an activated Rescue app should be a matter of course in the mountains today.
Zeman a monument-keeper - A man straining the constitution calls for law enforcement
Those who move in the camp's divided society and don't want to be completely alarmed welcome to situations where they don't have to root for their own. When they can admit the pluses to even who he or she criticizes otherwise. Even so as not to feel that he is only oriented according to the premeditated stickers. Such situations include a list of the severely damaged monuments that President Zeman fences on his favourite trips to the regions.
Everyone knows what it is. And who sometimes travels through the Czech Republic, a series of devastated monuments - from the centres of historical towns to individual castles, monasteries, old houses, churches or estates - he or sheer eyes to see. Everyone suspects that demagogy can come to the word here, too. That if we reproach the town hall for not care about the monuments or some horror in the zoning plan, it may be the work of the former administration. Or the object being privatized, the owner of which is not traceable. The head of the state of local politics calls for: "The Paragraf of the Monument Act allows you to fine you the owners of the objects who do not care about their property." But even when the owner of the owner is not acceptable.
Of course, Miloš Zeman would not be Miloš Zeman considering all the details and formalities of the complex problem. But he is a good thing like squatters whom he does not recognize. Two years ago we wrote: "Despite all the abuse, squatters point out the problem standing outside the current interest. The fact that this or that construction is in a state of disrepair." And let's face it, the president is doing the same de facto the same thing.
If you come to the historic centre of Jáchymov, you marveled at how devastated it is - including houses with Renaissance cores. At a time when Jáchymov celebrates 500 years of mining of silver and minting of dollars (for the Americans. Why? They say the speedy sale of houses in the 1990s, officials there say. But what is it about the fact that the Ostrov, the seat of the Shorts, who have been razatting the Jáchymov tolars, has a nicely repaired historical core? It is good, if the president draws attention to these things.
Babiš in memorial to the victims of the terror called for security cooperation
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and his wife Monica visited the September 11, 2001 Memorial of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York, Ground Zero.
Terrorism is the main enemy against which all the countries of the world should fight together. At the end of a five-day visit to the United States, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš said so today at the New York Memorial of the Terrorist Attacks of 11 September 2001. On this occasion, the Prime Minister honored the memory of two victims of Czech origin.
"It's a very moving place," the prime minister said when, accompanied by his wife Monica, he laid a white rose on the names of Lukáš Rambousko and the Czechoslovak emigrant Alena Sešínová. Both were among the more than 2750 dead who claimed the attack by the hijacked planes on the former pair of World Trade Center skyscrascrapers (WTC). The WTC's tolls collapsed after the crash, in their place now a memorial with the namesake of the victims.
"It is worth remembering what happened here, the horror," said Babiš. The attack on the US from September 11, 2001, was described by the prime minister as a reason why the UN should cooperate in a unified campaign against international terrorism. The terrorists then crashed the hijacked aircraft into the Defense Department building in Washington, planned to strike a target in Washington, apparently the White House or Congress. But this aircraft crashed when passengers faced the February Scenes.
"This is our main enemy, where all the countries of the world should unite and fight international terrorism in a coordinated way," the Czech Prime Minister added.
Slovenians also beat Polish world champions to reach the final of the European Championships
The Slovenian volleyball players will be sensationally playing for the European Championship's premier title. With the support of the nearly 12,000 stormtroasters in Ljubljana, they defeated the reigning two-time world champions Poles 3-1 and are the first finalists.
The will be decided on who they will challenge in the Paris climax on Sunday on Friday between France and Serbia.
The Slovenian team was much more compact in the semi-finals than the Polish world champions. They were only the start of the opening set and with luck with the finish of the second set, but the home volleyball players were outdid in defence and the players in the red and white jersey were basically scored only by the native of Cuba, León.
But in the home line-up, both the Khalt and Urnaut scorers presented themselves in the form of their life in the form of their lives, as well as second all-rounder Štern, who soon replaced the lacklustre Gasparini. The Poles paid for the fact that all previous matches at this Euros were won in a sovereign way, while the Slovenians gained confidence after tough play-off battles with both the Bulgarians and the Russians.
With the Poles in August this year, the Slovenians lost 1-3 in the Olympic qualifying qualifiers in Gdansk, but they were beaten at home. But they will leave the sold-out Ljubljana Arena. However, they are already assured of a second medal in history after today, in Paris they can improve the unexpected silver from the European Championships four years ago.
At the previous European Championships, the Slovenians finished eight-seat, behind the Czech national team.
Technology companies want to rule our cities
Francis Fukuyama's history has been somewhat diced up. In 1992, at the height of the wave of liberalism that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Iron Curtain, this political scientist wrote in his most famous book, The End of History and the Last Man, "What we may be seeing... is the final point of the ideological evolution of humanity and the universal acceptance of Western liberal democracy as the final form of governance."
Twenty-six years later, we are more likely to see how, from the US to Russia, from Turkey to Poland and from Hungary to Italy, the models are more likely to be won by the extras, and various forms of nationalism and radicalism are thriving. The current ninth Fukuyama book Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment is trying to cope with the advent of these forces. As his interview with George Eathon shows for the New Statesman, many of his former views are reassessing: he argues that the ideas of socialism should return back to the public space and Marx was right to understand.
"What I said at the time was that one of the problems of modern democracy is that it provides peace and prosperity, but people want more than that... Liberal democracies don't even try to define what a good life is. It leaves it up to individuals who feel alienated, don't see meaning, and therefore join groups of identity that give them a sense of belonging."
In its day, the book The End of History and the Last Man was written as a strong argument against Marxists who viewed communism as the final stage of history. When Fukuyama is asked about how he now perceives the ups and downs of socialists in Britain and the US, he replies: "This all depends on what you mean by socialism. If we are talking about ownership of the means of production, then except when the public's services are in demand, I don't think that will work. But if you have in mind redistributive programs that attempt to solve a huge imbalance in income and wealth, we are already witnesses, then yes.
In the end, Fukuyama is also attempting to calm the current situation, and all the liberals warn that the emergence of new not entirely democratic regimes will not mean the end of history.
Soldiers rehearse, pull the curtains down. China is planning celebrations at the site of the massacre
The Army rehearsed the parade during recent weekends. Shops in central Beijing had to close and residents near the square were ordered to close their curtains. Military carts pouring across the vacant streets and fighting aircraft circled in the sky.
Several Chinese told Reuters they were proud to display their military strength, but one woman said it was difficult to deny that the celebrations would be unsettled by other states.
She was probably referring to Taiwan, which is claimed by China and where the election is approaching. But it may also be worried in the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong, in which thousands of people repeatedly demonstrate against the Chinese-as-authorse-as-an-homed administrator.
Celebrations are also being prepared outside of Beijing. South China's Siamen port performed a special light show on Thursday night. The Xiammen lies opposite the island's Taiwan and is one of China's ten most uniqueest cities.
A list of banned things is growing before the anniversary. It already features drones, balloons, dragons, alcohol, radios and radio-wave devices, The Guardian reported. He added that China's popular social network Weibo eroses "harmful political information."
"This is another milestone, another opportunity to show that the Chinese Communist Party remains (at the oar) despite all the predictions," said historian Maura Cunningham, who deals with China. "It's a moment when the party can demonstrate order, control and power," she added.
The People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 when the Communists, under Mao Zedong, won the nationalists in the fight with Chiang Kai-kass's nationalists who backed down to Taiwan.
In the second half of the 1960s, China underwent a disastrous communist experiment in the form of the so-called Cultural Revolution. In June 1989, the regime in Tiananmen Square of Tiananmen massacred with tanks massacred from among students and workers.
Since the late 1970s, China has been increasingly embracing the elements of the capitalist economy. Critics say the blending of the worst of communism (one-party monopoly and persecution of the opposition) is now (Dickens) capitalism (exploitation of workers).
Czechs or children's entry forbidden. Choi revealed discrimination in restaurants
These included, for example, erroneous information about prices and non-compliance with the principles of fairness of sales.
In one case of discrimination, a restaurant in Prague refuses to let smaller children into the business. According to the ČOI, he writes on his website that the facility is not suitable for children under the age of eight. "To an electronic inquiry by the consumer, whether it is possible to book a table for four adults and one child in the mentioned restaurant, the restaurant employee replied electronically that they do not accept the presence of children under the age of eight in the restaurant," Fröhlich said.
In the second case, another Prague-based company did not want to let Czech-speaking people to the table, while allowing it to be English-speaking. "Czech-speaking inspectors, in the position of the consumer, was not allowed to sit at the table in the restaurant and make an order. English-speaking consumers were allowed to do this," a spokesperson for the Choi said.
Both cases are now being dealt with in administrative proceedings. As they are not yet definitively completed, the inspection spokesman could not disclose more information to the mentioned restaurants.
Discrimination, however, occurred only in a very small proportion of restaurants inspected in the second quarter. In total, the CTIA carried out 139 inspections. In addition to the two cases of discrimination, other errors were detected in 64 cases. Most were shortcomings in adherence to the principles of honesty of sales and not informing the consumer about the prices of products and services in accordance with the regulations.
Earlier on Wednesday, the inspection reported on cases of discrimination against foreigners in two Prague restaurants, Clock Caffé and Café Restaurant. In both establishments, foreigners were charged higher than Czech-speaking clients. In these cases, final fines of CZK 60,000 have already been issued.
A holiday with a credit card only? The NEO account offers withdrawals from ATMs around the world for free!
According to surveys, roughly half of all Czechs who go abroad have become accustomed to paying directly by card. The main reasons include, in particular, comfort, safety, but also the possibility of using travel insurance, which is often linked to the credit card.
The discounts when paying with a card can be appreciated by travellers in almost every corner of the world. This is especially true in popular tourist destinations, but today payment cards are accepted almost everywhere. "People who travel more often, perhaps for work, do not have time to go to exchange in exchange offices repeatedly to exchange cash. And even "vacantors" do not want to rely on the fact that they are enough for cash. Moreover, some foreign currencies do not even have the money or the exchange offices. For the NEO account, we have solved this so that its users can free withdraw cash from all ATMs, whether everyone, says.
In addition, a payment card is a much more reliable way than in cash to lose their money. When losing a full wallet, its owner may not see the money he carried in it. However, if he loses only his/her payment card, he can easily block it immediately over the phone or via internet banking. Thus, he does not have to suffer any financial loss at all during the quick negotiations. "Backing money in a bank account has other benefits in addition to their reliable protection. For the NEO account, this is, for example, the interest rate of 1.6% per year, which is one of the highest among the highest and savings accounts. Its establishment and the administration takes place completely online without the need to visit the branch.
For anyone who is going to go abroad, travel insurance should be a matter of course. Thanks to the possibility of arranging it and paying by card online, it is possible to do so even at the last minute. However, the very ownership of the payment card often means insurance protection when travelling. "For example, with the embossed cards of MasterCard Gold and MasterCard Business, travel insurance is an integral part of the foreign trips to all countries of the world. Holders of these cards can also insure their family with which they travel. Often they are no longer covered by any further arrangements," adds Kateřina Petko from Expobank CZ. However, it is always appropriate to check the extent of the insurance.
We are looking for motivated immigrants. The pre-story of the children's clinic is being built by an international team of doctors, we bring their stories
The Albanian Ledjona Toni studied medicine in Czech and today few will know that she is a foreigner.
Hundreds of medics from abroad are studying in the Czech Republic who could stay and work here. A pediatric clinic in Motol, Prague, has attempted to acquire some of them.
To get to the Motol Hospital in Prague around 5 p.m. to get to Tara Hussein Tayeb. She had to get up early. A Kurd woman with her short-skinny hair flew to the Czech Republic from Suleimania, a city in the northeast of Iraq, where she works as a pediatrician in the hospital and in the afternoon she still treats small patients in private practice. In addition, she teaches at the university.
Spilkova in par. She is on the verge of advancing in Indianapolis after the first round
Golfer Klára Spilková is on the verge of reaching the final rounds after the first round of the Tech Championship in Indianapolis. On Thursday, she played two birdies, two bogeys at the LPGA series and finished the opening day in the par. With a 72 result, she is in a share of 699., which is the expected cut.
The 24-year-old Spilkova returned to the circuit a month ago after a two-month health break and failed to make it to the second half of the tournament in Portland. She took the rest due to fatigue and exhaustion after a previous illness.
The first Czech winner of the professional tournament for the LET European series is the first-year member of the LPGA Tour and has not been doing very well so far. She has made the cut three times in 12 tournaments, the best she was 32nd in Hawaii. She is struggling to keep the card for the next season.
The tournament in Indianapolis was best played by Korean Hor Mi-chung. After the first round, she scores -9 and a two-shot lead over a trio of opponents.
Prague Stock Exchange grew slightly, with Czech banks, O2 or Avast doing well
The Prague Stock Exchange closed the trading week with a slight rise. The PX Index rose 0.13 percent to 1038.45 points. It was driven up by Czech banks, telecommunications company O2 or technology firm Avast. On the contrary, Austrian titles and media company CME failed to do so. This is according to the trading results on the stock exchange website.
For most of Friday's session, the Prague Stock Exchange traded in a slightly positive territory and eventually finished with a small profit. "However, it lost slightly over one percent in the whole week (the PX index)," said Josef Dudek from Fio banka.
Domestic banks have partially corrected the declines from the past few days. Komerční banka improved by 0.82 percent to CZK 803 and Moneta Money Bank by 0.41 percent to CZK 72.80. Avast shares appreciated 0.89 percent to CZK 113, and O2 operator added 0.46 percent to CZK 216.50.
Kofola's securities grew the most, by 1.38 percent to CZK 294. Less than a percent was won by the tobacco company Philip Morris, whose shares rose to CZK 13,640.
CEZ's energy firm's securities stagnated at Thursday's value of CZK 520.
Three titles were lost - Erste Bank was off 0.87 per cent to CZK 779.20, CME 0.73 per cent to CZK 109 and insurer VIG 0.40 per cent to CZK 618.
The crown weakened slightly against both major world currencies. It lost four cents to 25.85 CZK/EUR per euro, to the dollar three halves to 23.62 CZK/USD. This is according to data on Patria Online.
My heart is like a bell and a non-smoker's lungs. I'll just have some IVs, joked Zeman
The head of state underwent several hours of medical examination at the Central Military Hospital (ÚVN) on Tuesday. According to the director of the hospital, Miroslav Zavoral, the doctors did not find any "challic conditions" for the president. The president will celebrate his 75th birthday on Saturday.
The doctors at the president's check revealed mild signs of dehydration. His problems with low pressure were caused by the lack of watering. "To fix the dehydration of the organism, I will take a few infusions that will get into my body's body," said Zeman.
Otherwise, however, according to him, the director of the ÚVN stated that "the Czech state has a healthy president". The president mentioned in this context that Zavoral had received several hate messages due to a medical examination.
According to the president, the doctors examined him thoroughly and did not miss a single place on the body. "So a brief recap: the heart beats like a bell, the lungs are clean, as if he were not a smoker, the liver works as if I were a teetotaler, the kidneys are fine too and I can go on and on," Zeman said.
The editors of iDNES.cz contacted the military hospital to comment on Zeman's statement about her health.
The question of Zeman's health became an issue especially at the time of last year's presidential election or in some public appearances, in which Zeman has a clear difficulty walking. According to Prague Castle, the president is having a bad walk because of diabetic polyfunctional neuropathy. He also has problems with low pressure and hears worse. He has reduced smoking for his health.
Scientists look for toddolatas with birth defective, called ankle valgosy, the ankle of valgosy
Valgosity (wear) of the ankle is a birth defect that affects five to ten percent of children. By default, they are treated with intensive exercise. Scientists are even more helpful to these children, so they have developed special shoes that should significantly speed up the treatment.
"We have two prototypes of shoes that will be worn by healthy children and children with a diagnosis to map the effect in both groups. Participation in the research will have no risks for the children and the measurement will be completely painless," explains Marta Gimun, research director at the Faculty of Sports Studies at MU.
Parents of both groups of children can report to the study via the web, where the registration form and all the information are available.
Scientists are looking for fifty children diagnosed and fifty healthy children. From each group, half will always wear health shoes and half will not.
"The moment when parents should enroll their child is the moment when they embark on their first separate steps, typically embarking on, for example, the furniture they hold when trying to walk. Participation in the research involves three measurements within seven months of the first steps of the child, each taking about 20 minutes, with half of the participants also including the wearing of the tested footwear," Gimun points out.
A pike in a pond, or a relatively affluent open-air museum?
Babiš chose for his optimistic view of statistics such as good security (the Czech Republic is the seventh in the world), a low unemployment rate, a low national debt. Or the figure that our country is, according to one recent study, the 24th in the quality of life of the 140 countries evaluated.
In a television interview on the occasion of the Architecture and the Development Summit, the developer Dušan Kunovský and the architect Josef Pleskot, however, also presented other, far from so "pink" data. For example, the Czech Republic is 154th in the world in the speed of construction proceedings. It may be that the current economic "boom" will not leave behind any significant builder's heritage as it was in the past.
The biggest obstacle is not only the existing legislation, but also the slow, non-performance bureaucracy. This is also documented by comparative studies in which the Czech Republic lags significantly in the overall quality and performance of public administration for developed countries.
Our country has simply failed to make good use of the potential of the good economic situation of recent years to invest in the future. While it is nice that salaries and pensions are increasing, people with a better standard of living will also want to have a place to live, to travel in, to travel in, to have quality cultural stalls, to live without an intolerable environmental burden.
But for example in the capital city of Prague, the inner and outer ring road have not been completed for years or to build a speedway or a metro to the airport. And Prague does not even have a modern, architecturally daring national library, a concert hall, or a national gallery. The reason is not only an absurd tussle over architectural competitions, land-use plans and building permits, as well as a kind of specific Czech conservatism, which adheres to the slogan "each more adventurous change is for the worse."
And when it seems that something more courageous might succeed, it will almost certainly be thwarted by preservationists or other somewhat sturdled associations, or by politicians. In the absurd drama surrounding the "blockbelling" of Jan Kaplický proposed for the new building of the National Library, President Václav Klaus even wanted to tie himself to the backpackers.
The list does not end with Prague. The Czech Republic is not able to complete its backbone motorway network, nor to start building train speedways, so Germany finally decided to run its tracks for superfast trains from Berlin to Vienna by "track" via Bavaria. In addition, repairs of existing infrastructure are sometimes heated in the shenanigans. Getting quickly from Prague to Brno is a fine puzzle.
Babiš came into politics with a promise to arrange "things." As for meaningful investments and the acceleration of cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, much has not happened yet. As of 2018, an amendment to the Act on Accelerating the Construction of Transport Infrastructure is in force, but we will have to wait for more favourable impacts, for example, to be more favourable under-regretions of land. And a new building law passed by the government, which should reduce the current average construction control from 5.4 years to one year, starting if we are lucky, it will apply from 2021.
Unexat wants $45 million from the state
The Ministry of Justice, according to the spokesman of the office, Vladimír Řepka, has received six requests in this connection so far and is now analysing them. The teenager was in prison for assaulting the woman for two years, but the judiciary eventually acquitted him.
The appeal in the case was not filed by both Attorney General Pavel Zeman, as was the Minister of Justice, Marie Benešová.
The attempted murder of a hairdresser in Hořice happened in February 2013. The Hradecká prosecutor's office accused the then 20-year-old student of the Nečesaný grammar school. The prosecution claimed that he had hit the woman several times in the head with a loy and then took over ten thousand crowns from her. The seriously injured woman was found by her son, her life was saved by the doctors at the Hradec hospital.
Unexcribed from the outset, he denied any wrongdoing. "I am innocent and I swear by it. I am sincerely sorry for what happened to the victim, but I am not the perpetrator," the young man, who did not deny that there was a fateful day in the hairdresser's hairdresser. He said he wanted to get a haircut. But he left after the woman told him that he was already closing.
The hairdresser did not recognize him as an aggressor at first during the interrogation, but later called the Uncombed an attacker. According to forensic experts, she suffered from memory lapses after the attack.
The Hradecký Regional Court gradually handed down five sentences in the case. First, he found Nečesaný guilty twice and sentenced him to 16 years in prison, the High Court of Appeal reduced his sentence to 13 years. The uncombed gradually headed behind bars twice, but each time he was freed after the intervention of the Supreme Court. After a court order, the court eventually issued repeatedly acquittal, the last one was upheld in March this year by the High Court.
However, the chairman of the Board of Appeal, Jiří Lněnička, also stated in the grounds of his findings that the decision was wrong, but he said he had no better choice given the procedural situation. He said he had rejected the prosecutor's appeal against the acquittal, even though her appeals were justified.
"The problem with this is not that there is a lack of evidence, but an assessment of it. We believe that a sufficient amount of evidence was gathered in the pre-trial proceedings that would be more than sufficient in another criminal case to find guilty," Lněnička stated.
But the Hradec, but even the Supreme Court, looked at the case differently, and their opinion would probably not be changed by the further setting aside of the acquittal.
Epilepsy has made his love of sport difficult, thanks to surgery she has new hope
For the first time, Honzik's parents noted that something was wrong with him, in the year and a half. He always looked into the space for a few minutes, immobile and did not respond to anyone. The pediatrician therefore sent him to a pediatric neurological clinic, where doctors, after a series of examinations, gave him a diagnosis of epilepsy and immediately put in medication, which did not work immediately.
It took almost a year for doctors to find the ideal combination of medications that made him completely stop having seizures. At the age of five, the doctors took his medication off, and because the seizures did not return, the parents considered that Honza was healthy and began to lead him more to the sport. He cycled, skied, played tennis and floorball, spent his free time playing with his sister and friends. But at the age of 11, he had another seizure and it all started again.
Doctors rehearsed various combinations of medication, but this time nothing worked, the seizures in the form of absences kept repeated. As Honza always stopped perceiving during the seizure, the parents were horrified to get it in the sport and get hurt. Gradually, Honza stopped riding his bike and traded ski skis for cross-country skis and snowboarding. Although the sport caused him to have a seizure from time to time, he never gave up it completely. He even fulfilled his dream and ran the Spartan Race race, but together with a friend who kept his eyes on him to help in the event of a hay.
When Honza was 15 years old, the parents decided to try to change doctors and contact the experts at the FN in Motol. After a series of examinations, the local doctors concluded that Honza was a candidate for surgical procedure to remove the deposit from his brain - a source of epileptic seizures. "I had to do 2 surgeries behind me, first the doctors put in my brain with probes that scanned his activities, then they could remove the deposit for me. It was a long-week hell for me. I just had to lie down and barely move, my head was sticking the wires that were connected to the computer," Honza recalls.
The surgery was successful and the doctors removed the rather extensive deposit. "The first days after the surgery it was very mentally challenging, Honza was apathetic, confused, sad and almost didn't speak. In contrast, how he is normally alive and communicative, it was a frightening change, but fortunately after a few days everything returned to normal," the mother describes, adding: "The month and a half of the surgery had 1 seizure, but according to the doctors, it happens. Since then it has been without seizure for 3 months."
This school year, Honza will graduate, in addition to sports, enjoys languages and has started working with the E Society, with which he travels around schools to sit on epilepsy. Honza is not yet fully involved in sports activities, he is starting to return to the sport slowly. "I am learning how to play the sport correctly, how to breathe well so that I don't put the body to put sudden stress, which is quite a bit of a toch with my competitive nature," explains Honza.
This year, therefore, she will not actively participate in the traditional EPPI of the boating triathlon, where the sick meet epilepsy and healthy athletes and which take place this weekend on September 28, 2019 at the Cheerful Sandpit. But perhaps next year, she will.
XXX Lutz can buy competitor Kik, the authority has allowed. But there's a catch
"The Competition Protection Authority, subject to fulfilment of the structural obligations set out in favour of maintaining the effective competition of the concentration of competitors - XLCEE-Holding GmbH, on the one hand, and Kika Furniture and Lambda Properties Czechia, on the other hand," said ÚOHS spokesman Martin Švanda.
XLCEE- Holding owns Möbelix stores in addition to the XXX Lutz chain. If it absorbed the Kika chain, it would occupy too much of the Czech furniture and accessories market. Therefore, it has to sell off part of the company's purchased company.
XLCEE-Holding also buys Kika branches in other countries where the chain operates, i.e. in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. Antitrust authorities must allow the transaction there too. The purchase of 22 foreign branches of the Kika chain from the Signa holding was announced by XXX Lutz in May. Signa took over the failing Kiku last year at a symbolic price.
The Kika chain entered the Czech market in 2005 and is number two after the Swedish company IKEA. Before it was taken over by the Austrian company Signa, it belonged to the South African firm Steinhoff International Holdings since 2013. It faced problems when it revealed discrepancies in its accounts. Kika has nine outlets in the Czech Republic.
XXX Lutz has been active in the Czech Republic since 2010. Alongside IKEA, Sconto, Jysk or Asko-Furniture, and Kika is one of the largest furniture retailers on the domestic market. The Möbelix brand has the same owner. After the takeover of Kika's foreign branches, XXX Lutz will already operate over 300 department stores in 12 countries. According to the company's website, its annual turnover is 4.4 billion euros (about $114 billion).
The library commemorates the anniversary of the death of Wenceslas IV with a manuscript exhibition
Six rare historical manuscripts from the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries, i.e. from the time of the Roman and Czech King Wenceslas IV, can be viewed today and on Saturday by people in Klementinum, Prague. The National Library has released them from its vaults to commemorate this year's 600th anniversary of Wenceslas' death. This morning, librarians and restorers placed rare originals in the display cases in the Mirror Chapel. Entry to the exhibition is free, open both days from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
An exhibition of papers called Ad mandatum domini Regis: From the Royal Office and the Václav IV Library, the library was prepared together with the National Archives. The written heritage from the reign of Wenceslaus IV is viewed by the National Archives from the point of view of official documents and the National Library from the point of view of literary works, said its author Jan Vojtíšek.
"The visitors can look forward, for example, to a work on the agriculture of Peter de Crescentiis, which is basically an encyclopedia of agriculture, or a breviary, a prayer book of one of the Benedictines of the Monastery of St. George at Prague Castle, from the beginning of the 15th century," he said, listing the reasons why people should look at the exhibition, according to him.
Also on display will be the Epistles of Peter from Blois, where the seminal of King Henry II of England is depicted in the opening miniature H (enrico). The author of the decoration is most likely the Master of Samson's History, who, in addition to two volumes of the Václav IV Bible, was also involved in the decoration of a number of other manuscripts. Visitors will also see the Latin anthologies of John Wycliff's tract collections from about 1411 to 1414.
Not a single book was preserved from the library of Václav IV on the Czech Republic. According to experts, this library was one of the most extensive and also most beautiful book collections in Central Europe at the time, because the young king longed to build a representative library to match the book collections of his French relatives. However, the library ceased to be extinguished soon after Wenceslas' death. Apparently, it was stolen or destroyed in the conquest of the Hussites Castle. Several codes were saved, however. Most of them are now owned by the Austrian National Library.
"We have a number of treasures in our collections and I am pleased that they are in a state that allows them to be exhibited and made available to the public so-called live and not only in the form of the Manuscriptorium digital library," said the director of the National Library, Martin Kocanda.
On the day of Saturday's national holiday, an exhibition called What Hides Under the Floor will also be open in Klementinum, which presents the local archaeological discoveries.
