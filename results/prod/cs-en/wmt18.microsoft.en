Civil rights movement issues travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Favoritism of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Recommendation for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and Missouri residents to pay increased attention when traveling across the state in the wake of a series of contentious racially motivated incidents currently occurring across the state," the association's statement reads.
The NAACP said it took the step under current Missouri laws that make it difficult to defend racially motivated acts in court, as well as as actions by law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
"There are civil rights violations.
People are stopped by police because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," NAACP President for Missouri Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
"We're accumulating the largest number of complaints to date."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the US state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated slurs directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in contentious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the state and was remanded in custody by police without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which states that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by police.
"The purpose of travel recommendations is to alert people and warn their families, friends, and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should bring money with them to pay their bail or warn their relatives that they are going to travel the state."
According to the latest FBI program numbers, there were 100 hate crimes reports in Missouri in 2015, putting the state in 16th place among all states.
The travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people for violating a law that the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but recently advocacy groups have taken these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family still has no peace after 12 years!
The murdered woman is model Sally Anne Bowman.
The Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie at the restaurant where she worked, who inflicted stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana together, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby café, watching the meticulous forensic work of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted assaulting a minor in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl dead lying in the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were arguing that night.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of a taxi driver," he said falsely.
According to his statement, the girl should have defended herself as much as she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's story was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After admitting, Dixie spoke of his and appetite for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at his ex-girlfriend's house, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told police.
He said he smelled adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," Linda told The Mirror.
And after 12 years, the family is facing further attacks from vandals destroying her grave.
It's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people at large who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the late girl's mother Linda told The Mirror of the disappearance of the ashes urn.
Linda was waiting for her attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Designer vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not pruder or conservative," says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started inconspicuously, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž went on a cycling flight in Moravia with his friends.
One of them brought not only a bike, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
"Different moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to work with another partner with the German manufacturer of design erotic equipment Fun Factory, which intrigued Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs an Intimity boutique in Prague's Benedictine Street, where he sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't he?
They are also design items.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about over lunch, you think?
Come on, don't be such puritans!
Berlin's Fun Factory, designed by acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
It opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic store than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all done in a beautiful, decent style, products displayed more like perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to accommodate the Prague business, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimacy was liked by both of them.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it's also, you could say, gentle," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the variant that laid out the shop into a garden of pleasure and a bedroom dominated by a bed prevailed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from FormaFatal Studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first he didn't seem ideal to us because he's not on the main street, but it made him sit in the name of Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so no one's looking at the customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to make a store that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And don't be ashamed of them for ever entering such a business.
When I walked into the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like going to the sex shop.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the sheer elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there's only female service in the store, just because women aren't afraid to ask for help doesn't mean a man's foot won't come here.
For the most part, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually can't estimate the right size and prefer bigger ones," Martin smiles at the common mistake.
It's these prejudices, the clichés that women need big tools, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men choose predominantly black underwear, whereas the female usually tends to tend to be more of a pink color.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one beats, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's kind of a non-contact clitoris stimulator.
I'm teeming with the adolescent need to smile with admiration at the serious tone with which I'm given the interpretation.
It's like it's not making a good one.
And it's not really going to happen.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well-taken.
It's some kind of last revolutionary novelty.
The first revolution was caused by a seahorse-shaped vibrator.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He has completely broken the taboo that can persist in some men, and that is that he sees competition in erotic aids.
"Different variants are made," he continues.
With one engine, two engines, remote control.
That's a popular category.
In a love connection, a woman can have a control in her hand and determine the intensity of vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain flop is the category of embed vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multipurpose aids and buy classic vibrators, even though they only use them externally.
At the same time, it is very popular in Western Europe, especially among younger customers.
What about the men?
It's hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
It'd have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," martin reflects.
"We have tools for them, too, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and on the experience of use.
It's completely different in Japan.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women were very into erotic aids, I object.
"That's the internet reality," it's explained to me.
The mundane is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just out of curiosity - what japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for roughly half of what is sold in Japan only.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not very violent.
On the contrary, we are quite a welcoming nation.
Certainly unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical client of the store is between 35 and 50 years old and "already has some experience both with sex life and with some aids.
She'll come for something nice, better, to complement her partner's life, or to herself." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of her to return by convincing each product that it is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to engage in specialties such as bondage and latex, because on the one hand we do not have the space for it, on the one hand, it is not really suited here.
Things like that could discourage those we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always been too scared to go to a sex shop because they were afraid something like that would come out at them.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really nice.
This is also due to the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever award winner was the seahorse in question "and this triggered a change throughout the industry.
Cheap materials began to be released and, on the contrary, work with healthy ones, other designs, different colors began to be produced...
It is pleasant that the czech woman, the popular designer Anna Marešová, is behind the design of some.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised how many people buy these Designer Things Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Venus balls from Anna Marešová.
She has done a really great job of presenting exactly what we are trying to present within the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started out as schoolwork.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to control the production process and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since it is not a large production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than large series.
I may be going a little upstream, but I think it is important to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could happen that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything," Anna later describes the situation to me, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
He does not meet with a negative or dismissive attitude.
They say that's the most people are embarrassed about.
"But even then they start smiling." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator on offer for which you can have a personal message made, and this year she is also planning her own lubricating gel.
In the next year, vibrating eggs and other novelties should be added.
The limits of healthy sex
I wonder where the limits of what's right lie.
Is there anything Martin Ráž wouldn't sell already?
It's so hard to define.
What seems normal to one may seem completely abnormal to others, so we define ourselves more by the assortment of branded manufacturers.
None of them go into any extremes.
Before we say good-bye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in in which a lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a natural 28 centimeters long.
So we had to write to her that we didn't have anything like that.
The question is, was anyone making fun of us?"
Even that happens from time to time...
A blow to Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Štědrý is battling a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend is battling a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, I'm afraid it's true," the singer himself confirmed to The Flash.
I know about my illness, and I'm still quite able to manage it under the circumstances.
"I'm taking medication to slow down the disease," he added, thanking loved ones for their support.
The whole branched family came together to make Karl's life easier.
His wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, and daughters from her first marriage Zuzana and Tereza come to see their father in the house on Bílá Hora, and his son Karel says Karlas.
Generous fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Nightingale to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's had 60 chemo treatments.
After that, he was able to return to work on the tennis court and on the ski slopes.
"I am predicted by the astrologer that I will be here by the age of 90," Karel told Blesku.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Charles admitted.
Actress Květa Fialová is now battling the same disease in the institute.
Do you have an Alzheimer's patient in your family?
See how to treat him.
Chile's parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be considered by the ÚS.
There is still an absolute ban on abortion in Chile, so it must not be implemented for health reasons either.
"I am sorry that the legislators have lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years," complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
Chile's Constitutional Court has 10 members and is expected to receive a new president by the end of August, who afp says is close to the opposition.
A bill repealing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court because it violated the unborn child's right to life.
MPs postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was heard by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, MPs approved the bill, after which the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, abortion should cease to be punishable in three cases: if a woman's life is in danger, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy is caused by rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office as president.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on abortion.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women behind bars serving up to 30 years in prison for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called a murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The Trump White House is now targeted by the Statue of Liberty
An unlaisnous sign of regime change is the criticism of statues.
Americans could tell as well as anyone about it - see the carefully staged 2003 overthrow of a statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad's Firdos Square.
Stephen Miller, one of the trump regime's key supporters, surely knew what was coming when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty during a heated debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants.
It should be added that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For that, he would have been lynched by a mob of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty's immitators.
But he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with Emma Lazarus' famous poem was placed on a pedestal, 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller reprim snaged Acosta, saying, "I don't want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines a light on the world.
A poem that has been placed additionally on a pedestal and to which you refer is not part of it."
Miller's really right, but as he said, this isn't about history.
These are, above all, the startling words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - inviting not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let him come to me, who will fall, who is poor, who is barely allowed to breathe freely, who is a wretched worm in the midst of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these "wretched worms" on our screens.
Miller did not seek to criticize poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the US.
This conflict about the significance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who after her death sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the pedestal of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has altered this meaning: in her poem, a female character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
Merging a poem with the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long tried to reverse that meaning.
In 2010, the well-known commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing america's flame to a backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
He's bringing the torch of freedom out of the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not supposed to illuminate the journey to the United States."
Oddly enough, Limbaugh is referring to an important thing.
The meaning of the statue depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the perspective of an exhausted and damned passenger, who often arrives in a new country with hope in his heart after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the path, but to incite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black sings praise for Scotland's british team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
Neil Black, director of the UK Athletics Federation, said the strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup squad would be a "huge asset to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London 2017 World Championships, which begin on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is happening" in Scotland and British athletics could learn a lot from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we'll work on it," Black said.
"I've spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
That's what people on the streets think.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will be seeking medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen as team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening statement was amazing," Black said.
"Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room feeling tremendously proud and motivated.
The passion and undisguled feelings Eilidh spoke to were unrepeatable."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record of 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Muir, a middle-distance runner, has set five British and two European records in the last year only.
At the World Championships, he will participate in the 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another great Scot is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500m.
Doyle recalls her first championship, at which Lee McConnell was the only other Scottish member of the team.
The team captain said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only did a large number of her teammates make the team, but in many cases they would also attack for finals and medals.
"What's extraordinary about being team captain is that I've been elected by the rest of the team. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is all the more gratifying," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It proves where we've gone.
They're athletes who will be thinking about the top spots on the podium.
And my opening statement?
Yes, I think it went well.
I was just pointing out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've been given a second chance at the race and I'm going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew of his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to criticize him for anything from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of expression can be taken away from us - and stupid and dumb will be led like sheep for slaughter."
Which brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on making him act like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
He was sued this week by the American Civil Liberties Union for his actions.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as unfounded, and there were many "who cares" views in comments online.
"It's just Facebook," many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely Democratic state, he is an immensely popular Republican governor.
He boasts the second-highest approval rating of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not immisive.
As you can see, he runs his state with certainty of his own and strictly adheres to the principles.
He has also proven skillful in using Facebook as the main means of connecting with his constituents - the first bare-headed photo after undergoing chemotherapy is no exception.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by his staff paid for with taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor, saying that the comments were blocked from the position of moderating the posts.
However, it is too easy to use the image of internet trolls, spammers or angry people.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people whose posts had been deleted.
And that is exactly what they are - real people who speak to their elected leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie's attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comments were not hateful.
"I politely noted that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other breaking news," she wrote in the Washington Post's comments section.
"I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people as promoting a so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of concerned citizens."
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam interest" would probably be called a "defense" by others.
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleted negative comments.
This is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets to collect and burn all the prints with criticism, or to arrest or silence protesters.
And that is exactly what is happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the latest public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media sites.
President Trump is facing legal action from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first major regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris, where she prevented one voter from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington times, the low cost of shipping had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers questioning Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people as part of the Online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were piling up in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundations of our nation.
And a true leader has to accept that.
Czechs quickly used free roaming, consuming more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, they have more time to browse the web, and under the parasol they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smartphone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of their operators at domestic prices.
This is based on fresh statistics from O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available on a flat-rate date than at home.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in Croatia, where the minimum number of our people goes during the winter, data consumption has increased even 50-fold this summer season.
Italy came second in the data usage ranking.
Most minutes czechs call from Germany, where many go on business even during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs every year, so it is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here have exchanged the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year's record was July 7th.
"Tens of millions of photos could fit in the data transferred," silvia Cieslarová, director of the mobile segment at O2, explained in detail.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
"Moreover, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic through Austria," Cieslarová explained.
While data has seen high year-on-year growth in data following the release of roaming charges, for telephony, growth is much lower.
The number of minutes called in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
Germany dominates with a huge lead over other countries.
"Roaming calls are more used by business customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a home atmosphere at renaissance club
Former golf number one Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere over the next three days at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, Scotland, which hosts the 25th Annual Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who hails from Northern Ireland, succumbed to Paul Eales on his way to the final last year at the nearby Archerfield Links Golf Course. This year, he will serve as the tournament's ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up in front of my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," Rafferty said.
"Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent defender of this game and proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
Englishman Eales will defend his championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," the Southport golfer said.
"I did not have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year, when winning meant a lot to me and my wife Sharon.
These were beautiful times I won't forget."
Returning to home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region this year.
The event will be his first appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said of Helensburgh.
"You want to do well and feel a lot of pressure.
I really liked playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far."
The trio will also be joined on the course by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free of charge. The parking fee is £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in indonesia's gold country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pelvis.
In her wooden shack, located in the capital Paniai Enarotali in Indonesia's Papua province, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the locals "note" - right into the fire.
After half an hour, he removes the potato and enjoys it with unmyated hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof is a toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to work in.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night is a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, the village is home to soldiers.
"In the afternoon after 5:00, no one dares roam around the village," bardina says.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public uproar in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and ravaged city that you can reach it after a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach-closing ride.
Public transport does not work in this place.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners have looked at this place.
Before christians arrived, locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," bardina says, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark T-shirt and shiny skirt.
"We used to only carry leaves."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and its child mortality and literacy rate is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, however, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
Grasberg, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoeenix, U.S., is located just 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey that is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua supports logging worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these wealthes are a source of suffering for the Papuan and a guarantee of oppression by Indonesia's powerful military.
An investigation conducted by the New York Times in 2005 shows that Freeport paid local military officials and troops about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely repressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tormented and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
Mass murders in the Papua tribal region during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that took place last year as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful protesters.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The situation has been made worse by the fact that Papuan resources are attracting colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% claim Christianity, but demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from indonesian islands - Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteen sells fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
The local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, for work.
"The indigenous people of Papua - mama-mama (women) - so they lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and rights violations during his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai, on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But very little has changed in Papua and the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would heed our call for justice," You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi's inauguration in October, Paniai experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas songs by a campfire in enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the gloom of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by the resupet and tone with which she was told and later returned with four other soldiers, said yavedt Tebai, a local vicar.
Two of the soldiers in a intoeaged state chased a group of children and beat them with the butt of their weapons, victims and witnesses said.
One of the soldiers then fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby electoral commission building, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field outside the local police station and army headquarters, in an insu great service.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - in which they run in a circle and imitate the singing of birds - of the Papuan tribe of me Pago.
Several protesters began throwing rocks at the buildings.
As tensions escalated, the soldiers were ordered over the radio: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot," according to TIME, in an official document whose contents were never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), head of the Enarotali kego Koto district, identified the impending danger and called on residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one should heed his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame doesn't yet know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people all around and there was a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to my body to make sure it was really him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME in a gloomy voice.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua's police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely "securing" the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped with injuries.
News of the murders shriaded through jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapara, expressing his sympathy for the victims' families and vowing to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again," he said.
In October 2016, National Security Minister Wiranto announced that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to address past violent crimes.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to sound.
"Most violent crimes took place a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
But in a June 5 interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta, Wiranto said he had no plans to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, "all cases will be referred to court."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" following more than 1,000 deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor - said 11 human rights violations in Papua have been settled so far, including an incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his claim with disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but I haven't seen anything yet," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
As he says, a few years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," as he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be shot by the army or shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Paniai residents who are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by members of the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the gunfire hasn't stop yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The scuffle, in which one person died and 17 others were injured, occurred between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting an unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to police, the villagers threw rocks at the officers and responded with a warning shot.
However, locals claim that the Mobile Brigade (Indonesian Paramilytarist Police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation," Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured, told TIME.
"I haven't left the house in two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police to be punished and for the mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the indonesian government's eye.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous peoples of the me, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of insurgents that protects papuan rights by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. They are among the non-Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty."
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among papuai residents as a "tragic and forgotten place."
Poverty is fueling the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
And bread is still unassuchable.
Locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivations four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the needs of the family, the rest are sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Already few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education they need to get into business.
"Young people are moving out of villages because of a lack of jobs and money," said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to isolation, papua province is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua because of a "lack of cooperation with the authorities," despite the fact that they were given such a rare filming permit.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, deputy director of human rights watch's Asia office, Promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost regions of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia's Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, marshall islands and Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the accusations, saying to reporters in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic system and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations."
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Human Rights Envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, locals were calling out the slogan "we want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
More elections are scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shootings in Paniai," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a marrow army - are in poverty, poor education and a health system.
Gobai argues that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, regard their vote as a "debt" that Jokowi must repay.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting continue their latest symbolic act of defiance: burying the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done, at least he will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy seized a yacht in the Pacific holding 1.46 tons of cocaine worth roughly $256 million.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
A four-man crew of the ship, believed to be from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested in the raid.
The yacht, named as Afalina, set sail from South America and was towed by police to a port in Nouméa, the french overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean, after being detained.
The Australian Intelligence Service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were going and to uncover a "Lithuanian syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have led to the stopping of large quantities of drugs heading for Australia," said its executive director Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for their smugglers due to high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first recently.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia that tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking must be reminded of them.
The problem may be in nursing homes, according to the doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General University Hospital in Prague Pavla Mádová, infusions of saline solution that are injected with a thin needle under the skin could be a solution.
However, these are only applied in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"Plus, they lose their thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," Said Mádlová.
Two liters should definitely be drunk.
"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.
In nursing homes, she says, no doctor often sees it.
In hospitals, dehydration is routinely dealt with by infusions.
"I think that even there it should be phased in so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two pint bottles of saline can be delivered to old people in a day.
Lack of fluids can cause maladity, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration manifests itself as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
Blood thickenes and cloggs the blood vessel in the brain, there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a duvet, maximum cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more nursing- intensive, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient from time to time and let the skin air out," the doctor said.
The Torch skyscraper was on fire for the second time in Dubai
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers burst into flames on Friday. Firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-metre-high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire in the last two years of this high-rise building, which bears the aptly named The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
"We were asleep and woken up by an alarm. We heard screaming.
It took us 10 minutes to run down from the 50th floor," Geroge, one of the skyscraper's residents, told Reuters.
Dubai's Civil Defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4 a.m. (0000 GMT), before continuing to cool the building.
Government officials added that they provide alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could once again spark a debate about the safety of materials used to clamm buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation launched by the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged were the panels and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the insulation and cladding system at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire, which killed nearly 80 people.
Survey results showed that more than one in five passengers to the US carry prohibited items on board a plane
A passenger survey showed that more than 20 percent of them knowingly or unknowingly uttered prohibited items through U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints aboard the plane. At least six percent of the passengers boarded the plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than 1 percent of passengers say they belatedly discovered they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition or explosives.
Based on the results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and to which more than 1 000 interviewees replied - it showed that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to trying to knowingly travel with an object that is banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand hours of flying, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that have escaped TSA attention include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly uttered a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of men surveyed also admitted to deliberately uttering prohibited drugs on board the plane.
The company said it was conducting research among passengers around the world to determine how many of them accidentally delivered unauthorized items through airport control and how many did so on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, most people who have carried unauthorised items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and how much they can carry to the plane.
Unsurprisingly, the TSA confiscated the most banned liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA would handle books the same way they would handle smuggled goods.
The transport of liquids is permitted on domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA Chief Scott Pruitt on postponing planned Obama administration emissions reduction directives
After 15 states were sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, its boss, Scott Pruitt, rescinded his earlier decision to delay implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes as part of his plan. It thus responds more briskly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal challenge filed against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
This concerns the last deadline, which was set for 1 October, when states should start complying with the 2015 regulation to reduce ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interference with local decisions or impending economic growth."
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma's attorney general before president Donald Trump took over as EPA chief, has long served as a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly shifted or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's abrupt reversal is the biggest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that an EPA executive overstepped his authority in an effort to detract from the Obama administration's plan to require oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to working with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
"Under the previous administration, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set plans," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through litigation and take compliance seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes out of it."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt can use "the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities" at some point to ensure that regulations "are based on sound policies and the most accessible information."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a more comprehensive rewrite of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group has no legal authority.
"The reversal of EPA opinion - following our lawsuits - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone is produced when common harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with solar radiation.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are grateful for Pruitt's sudden change.
"It's disturbing what pressure needs to be exerted to change the minds of those responsible and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to struggle with the Trump administration's ideological campaign to help polluters and special interests."
He doused a man with acid, yet he's not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're at home with your family laughing, the next, your whole life changes from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate belorated Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was scalded with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
The information was reported by Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the Door of the Christopheros' house.
Andreas got up to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
A man he'd never seen in his life doused him with acid right after opening without warning, saying, "This is for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes fell apart like nothing, and all I felt was incredible pain on my skin," Andreas said.
The family rushed him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned terrible news - he had no chance of surviving, according to doctors.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the faces that doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient's body were affected.
A major complication for Christopheros was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most tor tor tor torch I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from an unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said, describing his suffering.
Today, Christopheros has had 12 surgeries, far from the last.
Injuries suffered by victims of acid attacks can require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have tissue scarred for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and fight deformity and disfigurement throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The assailant was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that the unidentified man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed he was a veto against a man who sexually abused a close friend.
The police investigated the case properly and later tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, later, to the astonishment of christopheros' family, the verdict changed fundamentally.
"Three judges ultimately concluded that the sentence should be overturned because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of corrosive substances infestations has increased considerably.
The country's Interior Ministry has commented on the issue by planning to lay down new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of corrosors.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of such attacks are not going to give up.
They are demanding that the UK Government enforce stricter and longer prison sentences for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for tightened controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as they are different detergents.
In the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous Skyscraper The Torch, one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned down at night.
According to dubai civil defense, the occupant of the 80-story building was evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, the fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We were asleep.
We were woken up by an alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," tenant George described the events.
Another witness told CNN that the flames engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, a fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building fell on them.
After about two hours, according to a civil defense statement, the fire was managed to get under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, the power went out in the surrounding buildings.
A massive fire damaged Dubai's The Torch skyscraper in February 2015, destroying more than 100 apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then, no one was hurt, as the inhabitants were evacuated in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and at that time, with its 352 meters, it became the tallest residential building in the world.
Another Dubai skyscraper took the record the following year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his system.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, the sample of 23-year-old Ippolito had a varied collection of illicit means - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson's or anorexia drugs.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year distancing and prosecution.
The record was 9/11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record amount for athletes caught before then.
The third-year player said he had started taking steroids the year before when he fell into bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She hugged passionately with her ex-lover!
As soon as Lucka Vondráčková entered the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And it also draws attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older at the time and already longed for a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly didn't want to hang up her career.
So they walked apart, but they remained friends to this day.
Which they also proved at tv prima's press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both matched in blue.
At first they ignored each other, but then they became close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes until she fell by her belly.
Then they hugged and willingly posed for photographers.
However, their meeting was no accident, because they will play a couple of a lover in the new series of Prima Captain Exner.
Islamists have been given life sentences in the UK for ploting an assassination.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell called the Three Musketeers to life in prison and planned a terrorist attack against police and the military, according to prosecutors.
Four men, two of whom took part in a training camp in Pakistan and had previous convictions for similar acts, were arrested last August.
At the time, authorities believed he was about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "infidel" in Arabic, and a mock-up of a gun.
This happened when an MI5 secret service agent was planting a listening device in the vehicle.
"The recent assassinations have shown the horror the defendants could have caused if they had not been stopped," said Deputy Prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for release after 20 years.
A fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men pleaded not guilty and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In hodonínsko they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region, it was surpassed by Thursday, which became the warmest day of the year so far.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, not many temperature records fell on Thursday compared to Tuesday.
On Tuesday, records were broken or evened at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
In Strážnice, for example, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region, Thursday's 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
It was ten degrees lower in the west.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the heat was highest in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMÚ website, Thursday's highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures there only started to rise later in the afternoon," meteorologists said.
According to ČHMÚ, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade away, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
However, in most parts of Moravia, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of its visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to exert its influence without using force.
It spends $10 billion a year supporting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry into foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But Beijing is failing to do so.
Local state media talk about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic change and modernization.
But the number of arrivals rose by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, for all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, christopher balding, an economics professor at Peking University, assesses the situation in the world's most populous country in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, and citizens of the others must obtain a visa in advance.
At Chinese offices in the US, therefore, the crowds are comparable to chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait long hours in line for it, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans visited Hong Kong, which accounts for less than 3% of China's gross domestic product and is home to less than 1 percent of the population.
China often exacerbates the problem itself by using tourism to achieve its political goals, such as disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a spat over South Korea's anti-missile system, The South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan recorded an 85 percent increase.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US Central Bank, the Fed may have abandoned China as much as $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China receives about $35 billion a year in selling currency to incoming tourists.
According to official balance of payments figures, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China's entire surplus in trade in goods.
So a small number of tourists are dealt a very painful blow to a country that is anxiously preventing capital outflows.
However, the above factors are only one manifestation of more general reticence towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
As of 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living across China.
Some individual cities have more in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has double that.
At the same time, a number of scientific papers show that immigrants tend to revive economic growth, entrepreneurship, and innovation.
However, you will hardly find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step on offer is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, not only India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and make visa procedures easier and cheaper.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo, they reproduced deadly poisonous reptiles.
The Kingdom of Poison in Pilsen can enjoy the cubs of three rare, deadly reptiles.
So far, only all nine newborn Turkish-born stills will be seen in the exhibition.
This species lives in northern Anatoly, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"It also grows to a meter in length," said Martin Vobruba, a zoo spokesman.
Meanwhile, the cubs of the other two species, the lethal and the red cobra, will gain strength in the breeding background of the garden.
We can't tell when people are going to see them yet.
"We would not like to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, noting that it could take up to a year or two.
Eight Australian mice have been born, they are descendants of a breeding pair native to the population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition is one of the death knails around Perth," Vobruba said, noting that in human care, wintering of 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius is necessary for die-hard.
100% success was accompanied by a bunch of African spitting red cobras.
A total of four cubs hatched from four eggs at the Pilsen Zoo.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to four meters away.
It's aimed at the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
Cubs of all three species feed on mouse slates in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they still expect to hatch chicks from a bunch of black mamba, eggs are laid in an incubator.
Unverifiable transcript of phone conversation puts pressure on Mexico to pay for border wall
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a january 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump edthsisted that he stop publicly saying he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The US President resunerted him for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, reportedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump vowed to build a wall along the southern border and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also been leaked, revealing a tense exchange.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US surveillance agreement on refugees heading for Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such a deal - which came out under President Obama - he would look "drugged" after proposing a ban on refugees entering the US.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call of the day."
Tusk testified again at the prosecutor's court for Smolensk.
"He has something to worry about," jaroslaw Kaczyński, chairman of the ruling PiS Law and Justice party, said in Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to worry about, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," Tusk replied, resuching the country's current leadership for trying to abuse the judiciary against political rivals.
As he left the prosecutor's office, a crowd chanted by Donald Tusk was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24! and wished the politician a hundred years!
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to worry about and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
He says he does not blame the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that the judiciary is intended to serve as a tool against poland's current rulers against opponents, the opposition or people they do not like, and I fear that I belong to this group.
It's the second time he's been interviewed.
The ex-prime minister was questioned at the prosecutor's court for the second time, this time the hearing was to relate to misconduct in the dissecting of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
Additionally, there was a need to get the bodies in the coffins.
Families were banned from opening coffins, and there had to be reasons for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of a scandal because it would strain Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, was supposed to serve to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU," Kaczyński argued on Trwam Catholic TELEVISION.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would thwart Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczyński said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could go differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take note.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's court on April 19.
Even then, he didn't testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many saw his summons for questioning as part of an apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
In Poland, the public prosecutor's office reports to the Minister of Justice, who serves as Attorney General.
The summons for questioning came soon after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, which Kaczyński tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlova protested alone against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also left Warsaw in the lurch.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the Chamber of Deputies from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
Since the last parliamentary elections in 2013, the Czech Republic has opened its embassies in these and several other countries.
This stems from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update, it is currently in the comments process.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries, new embassies have been created, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has changed," the material says.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the embassies to which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than 100 Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the press release.
It is their list that changes by decree.
Four years ago, Czechs were able to vote at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe, for example.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its presence in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
The consulate general in Donetsk will not vote either.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, the Senegalese capital of Dakar and Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to the Consulate General in Ir white, Iraq, and Chengdu, capital of China's Sichuan Province.
Ballots will also be available to registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose members at polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission will determine by lot the region for which candidates are voted abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when the decision was made between South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, Czechs voted abroad among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
Some 3,800 people came to vote at the premiere 15 years ago, around 6,700 in 2006, and 8,222 four years later.
Four years ago, 10,571 voters showed up at embassies for early parliamentary elections.
Moore's Ford Bridge massacre: activists recall racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by bystanders in Monroe, Georgia, and scathing toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns paved the way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled a cigarette for a long time and stared at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want that n--- and Roger!" the man shouted.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence is interrupted by the roar of a young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events of July 22nd.
But when one of the men throws a noose over "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists has been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge regularly to reconstruct that fateful night in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxkran.
No one's ever been tried for murder.
"It is surprising that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction of the event.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic challenge to action. Every year, he reminds the monroe community that justice has not been served.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin."
The medical examiner covers one of the bodies of the victims of the Lynching at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
Up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were scheduled to participate in the lynching, according to FBI files obtained by NBC News.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights advocates say both reasons for the lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the city's residents.
In April 1946, georgia's black residents won the right to participate in elections scheduled for the summer for the first time, following a supreme court decision.
And it was during the summer election that, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom was supposed to stab white landowner Barnett Hester during a scuffle - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, it was said in the city that Hester had been in a relationship with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and had got her pregnant.
According to an FBI statement, on July 25, 1946, then-major white landowner Loy Harrison posted $600 bail for Malcom.
He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their way back from prison, just before moore's ford bridge, a group of suspects were parked on their way.
"As it turns out, Harrison planned and organized the murders," the FBI concluded.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and local law enforcement officers, who not only participated in the lynching, but also disposed of evidence and withheld the identity of witnesses."
Brooks was more concise about the matter.
"It was a massacre because of the right to vote," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all black locals: 'this is what you're going to do if you register and vote'."
Cassandra Greene has been organizing the annual renovation of the moore's ford bridge event for nearly a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and concise. It shows deep-seated racism that many would like to see extinct in modern America.
It's not easy to watch this reconstruction, and it's even more difficult to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynchings because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us," Greene said.
"But we can't have a relationship unless you hear what I've been through."
The main rehearsals for this year's renovation began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen white men, the rest black - flocked to the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh serves as assistant director.
He played the leader of kukluxkan for many years, but in his words, the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it goes against who I am," Marbaugh said.
"I think it's very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time."
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom and, by the end of Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a scuffle - Malcom argues with Hester and accuses him of having slept with his wife.
"Get off my property n---e!"
You can't give rascona.
There's a scuffle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" he asks Rascon.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," Greene replies cheerfully.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'n-r' in that tone back then."
"Exactly," blurts out one of the black actors.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces a sense of rapprochement.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. If only to make it enough for the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time Rascona emphasizes the correct pronouncing of the N-word.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Roar, gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of actors singing Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit."
With every word, there's a sense of sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of all this, about a dozen onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are virtually the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came all the way from Ithaca, New York, many of the onlookers are from the surrounding area.
Each endures the local humid climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them in a crowd to malcolm and dorsey's graves.
Until now, murders could be viewed with hindsight, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is haunting.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites a crowd of onlookers to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel to the victims' heads, watch fake blood and motionless bodies, and whisper something in their ear.
"They're not dead," says the little boy.
A few minutes go by, and Greene thanks the audience. It's over.
Actors clean the rope and shed tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklin.
Nick Rascona hugs his two fellow actors and weezes in their arms; eventually, he's emotional.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know you resote from the role.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience and the actors sit down for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple talk with interest about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could scarcely find words to express her feelings about tonight's performance.
"It's hard to listen to those ugly words and look at those hideous acts... that are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said of the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical issue," she added, "it's just called police skirmishes."
Across the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in a courtroom. He's enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already started planning the show for next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about," he said.
"If we don't learn from this, who knows... It could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says only a coward reads the instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia the time long ago, when instructions for the use of anything were rather a rarity phenomenon.
For example, my first record player contained only one piece of paper with hieroglyphics showing the wiring of some components, all with some secret marks.
When something inside me went wrong years later, I offered the charter to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the backboard.
With a smirk, he advised me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was suitable for.
Yes, it was a common aid in chronic toilet paper depletion.
He playfully found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl pancakes again.
A new era has brought new guidance.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply held on to the crossed grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
A sketch describing how to put one part into another was particularly good.
The set was two-piece and no other procedure was possible.
To put it the other way around required considerable effort with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for the instructions ended up with my Seat Leon self-propelt.
The year of production in 2003 still had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, replacing the blinker bulb.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected to mention that while the bulb on the right could only be replaced in three steps.
1. remove the cover.
2. Unscrew the burst bulb and screw in a new one.
3. Open the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of placing the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting the upper right limb into the bowels of the car, I would scooch a spring, a screw, which I would easily move the cover with, and then I would follow the points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
Bridge error.
The shelter had no room, no room for cinderella's slender hand, let alone an obese Silesian.
I've lost half an hour of my life without any success.
The condition was enhanced by my wife's entrance to the garage, which was summoned by a squeal and words that he hears quite exceptionally from my mouth.
"What are you doing here?" she asked in a wordless way.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I omit the vulgar terms, there are only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she risked in what may be her last in a long-lasting union.
I slowly explained the problem to her, emphasizing the tortura procedure of the author of the manual, where blessing with the hot iron on the hand that wrote the instructions, then beheading her so that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to the wide range of instructions of the Witch Hammer, including its commission burning on top of the Losin castle.
"How about removing the box?" said the woman, removing the battery.
In sheer desperation, it happened, and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
Until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just going through a breakdown after checking two officials of the State Drug Control Unit.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field, and who can tell wild stories in an unruly voice.
"Imagine I've been fined for not having hand washing instructions posted," he told me weakly.
Gradually, I removed the whole problem from him, which was that he did not have picture instructions above the sink in the patient's toilet to wash his hands.
His argument to the commission clerk that adults usually know how to wash their hands, and that there is no need for pictograms to cope with the habitual activities of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him considerable money.
"It's not easy," she said.
He understood that simply rinsing washed palms with running water was a primitive act on the level of a cro-horse, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to tell that it is necessary to let water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is joyful to find out that one washed his hands exactly as the SÚKL house dictates.
Finally, I must point out that I was inspired and Am preparing a detailed plan for toilet activities.
In the question of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in the case of urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to post instructions two.
The problem remains the pictograms, because creating the perfect procedure also means an accurate drawing of all anatomical details, which could cause some outrage among the prudian toilet visitor, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has been wipching the hole with a completely wrong procedure throughout his life.
Pearson to 3,000 more employees and cut dividend in bid to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would shed an additional 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program aimed at changing the business model.
The next wave of layoffs, which CEO John Fallon said will occur in late 2018 and early 2019, follows the company's previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of a previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting programme in an effort to resurrect declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it reported a 1% rise in underlying sales in the first half of the year to £2.05bn.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in afghanistan's capital, Kabul. One NATO soldier died and several others were wounded in the attack, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in the attack in the Qarabagh district.
A bombing hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday's blast occurred after a patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device."
The statement also states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger and are in a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to intelligence officials, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a major source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of which died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a large explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people. It is the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. forces overthreal the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to assist the country's military forces and police officers.
According to reporters, the suicide bombings, which have shaken the public's confidence in the government in recent weeks, its regulations, and especially President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPA reconsiders its decision to defer smoking rules in response to lawsuit
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rescinded its decision to delay an Obama administration law that ordered states to cut emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision wednesday night to cede the "Ozone Standards 2015," saying it was presenting the agency's commitment to cooperation with states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will hear their views," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA's effort to de-ed the ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and determine limits based on measurements that must be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 from most Democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit Tuesday on the grounds that THE EPA's actions are illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to prevent many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in Trump's words, in an effort to boost economic growth.
But the new administration's efforts have launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing air containing ozone "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár got hit and blood was flowing!
You may have already noticed this relatively new singer in June of this year, when this hitherto almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event by Czech standards, at which he hosted such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not hosted by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show up to the public and present my music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was performed by the newly appointed personalities.
However, few people already know that the filming of the video clip itself, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first major shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it didn't go without a lot of embarrassment.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer's rival was supposed to suggest a slap in the face in the video.
At one point, however, he struck him so hard and directly in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, immediately blood came out of my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers told themselves that the situation on set was an accident and Ladislav did not react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the sequel to the next shoot.
We are now bringing you the aforementioned video clip of the young artist, you can also record the scene with the punch.
However, the failed version with blood was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of a duel
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting light-heavyweight boxing match, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room at ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia - the undefeated World Boxing Council light-heavyweight champion - went down to the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's champion.
After Garcia's unanimous decision victory against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime fight, both boxers made the list of the top five light-heavyweight boxers.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champion?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 7:00 p.m.
Boxers pose for photographers, and Lomačenka manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be a "perfect test."
"I'm a former dickweight champion," Garcia adds.
"I had to gain weight to fight Broner (67 kg), but I'm not that big.
At my 63 kg, I'm small.
I'd like to return to the light heavyweight category.
Lomachenko has to put on weight again to get lightly... Then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why not give it to them."
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxing would be good for this fight."
Klimas has made a demand for payment per view - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko is expected to make his light-heavyweight debut later this year and next year face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in fighting duel winner Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell on September 23 for the light-heavyweight title at the Forum Arena.
"The game should be in the style of paying for a view, that's what the fans want," said Garcia, who later said he was open to the possibility of broadcasting the match through the network that will come up with the best deal.
"We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw that much attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as an "amazing boxer" and could participate in his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko could not be lulled by Garcia's praise, saying that the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow... I'm sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then boxing.
Both fighters said they felt the rising tension before the duel.
"You won't forget this game.
No other game attracts that much attention.
And I will put a great deal of please in the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's going to be a great game."
A young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was just found at the bottom of the Volga.
A pair of young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova, have been missing since December 2005.
A large-scale search was launched for them, but without success.
And the police eventually closed the investigation due to lack of evidence.
The families of the missing couple lived in the uncertainty of not finding out what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad end of the story came.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksary in Chuvašsk.
It was only thanks to the documents left in the car that the officers were able to identify the couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without them it would have taken the police much longer to identify the found.
The couple were last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous for the time yet.
He reported his discovery to the Chechoksar police, who dragged the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by an icy road leading along the river.
However, the investigation continues, with further details to be published after its completion.
Latest test results to set the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who have been subjected to a new age-assessed method show that over 80 percent of people were surveyed as over 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started carrying out new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure came after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has referred 6880 cases for investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were assessed as over 18 years old, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency concluded that the interviewe was "possibly over 18 years old."
In a further 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewe was 'possibly under the age of 18'.
Tests shall be accepted only if the age of the interviewe is questionable.
According to Johan Gã¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are on track and the numbers are very similar," he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated at over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases, "the interviewe was found to be 18 years or older."
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the interviewees said he would be 18 this year.
The medical method of determining age, which includes an X-ray of wisdom teeth and an MRI scan of the knee joints, which is then assessed by dentists and X-rayologists, has also received criticism.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, is engaged in assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which the person has gone through puberty.
"I had reason to think about this issue and I don't think these types of age measurements are correct.
In a sense, the assessment of biological age is very uncertain.
If we can't determine age with precision, we shouldn't pretend otherwise," he told Metro.
The Agency's GÃ¶ransson, a forensic medical agency, defended the decision, saying: "In general, the risk of misreconceing a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the interviewe is just under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all interviewees."
Trump threatened the President of Mexico on the phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, though he acknowledged that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
That's according to transcripts of interviews published Thursday by The Washington Post.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border with Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with mexico's president shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically rebuced Peña Nieto for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He described his southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured mexico's president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press that," Trump repeatedly said in a January 27 interview, threatening to cut off contacts with mexico's president if he continued to issue defiant statements.
They say the funding will come up somehow, and it'll work out in the end.
"But if you say mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," Trump said, according to the US daily.
He called the wall the least important thing we're talking about, but politically, it may be the most important.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after taking power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the 3,200-kilometer wall, which has escalated relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States for now.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's january 28 phone call with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
He was prompted to reach such a conclusion by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting people from internment facilities in pacific island nations.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later accepted it.
"I'm sure you can say this isn't the deal you made, but you're going to have to stick to it," Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, such as when Trump praised Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation came to a sharpen.
"I hate accepting these people," Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people to work for local milkers," he said.
In the interview, he also noted that a fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump held telephone conversations with a number of world leaders at the end of January, roughly a week after arriving at the White House, often in one day.
He ended up calling Turnbull the least pleasant one of the day.
Before ending it, he pointed out that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
Rana's killer was executed in front of the crowd.
Her father watched.
The execution took place in a square in Yemen's capital, Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has hit an entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed crowd that had come down to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media after the execution that he felt.
I feel like I've been reborn.
I feel relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
Other family members were present, shouting the slogan "long live justice" along with the crowd.
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van, from which he was dragged.
The police put him tied up on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his gun on him and opened fire at point-blank range.
The crowd celebrated every shot that was fired.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice had been done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have prevailed," he added.
I stood in Liberation Square in Sana, waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into a hateful frenzy, grab the killer and lynch him.
The execution was ordered by a court governed by the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his actions caused such outrage that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his home, they discovered evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that carried Rana's body were horrific," he told the media.
"Rana disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our tv stations, posters of her picture hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents, who suspected their son of a horrific act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the area, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was being held and demand immediate punishment.
A Justice Department representative read the footage of the investigation to the crowd to reassure them.
The accused did not appear to be remorseful for his actions.
Just before serving his sentence, the police read him the sentence, but the convict looked at his executioner only a few times.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but many of the footage that was taken by the crowd appeared on the Internet.
West Virginia governor announces change of political party
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced thursday night at a rally for President Trump that he was switching sides.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," Governor Justice said.
"Today, after a long prayer and thought, I announce to you... Today, as a West Virginia resident, I say I can no longer support you as a Democratic governor."
A crowd of onlookers erupted in joy.
"I'm going to join the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had previously promised the people at a rally in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that said, "Governor Justice's defection is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of taking care of eping our country."
"For a Democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the fewest legislatures in history, governor Justice's announcement is the final straw for an already deaqual leaderless party that is trying in vain to find positive and unifying news," RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for sincerely apologizing for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time has not yet come for Russia's return to the sports world.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the head of Russian athletics, said at the IAAF congress - held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships - that his country's expulsion from the world of sport was correct and that he was committed to fighting doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who have lost gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into force in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report revealed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
"I think we have seen a very honest response and presentation today," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire federation."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have taken it to the next level, but Congress supports the crisis management team's recommendation to maintain the sentence that has been imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilise the situation.
Our goal has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest ones," he concluded.
At the World Athletics Championships, which begin on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the IAAF's strict rules will compete under a neutral flag.
IAAF Crisis Management Chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before it could be allowed back.
Drug tests are still inadequate and excluded coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF council presentation.
The CzechTrade state contract was awarded to the company of František Savov, who is being prosecuted by the state.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta František Savov.
Officials awarded him 100% points in all quality criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state prosecuted Savov for tax fraud and requested his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the Pro-Export Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade launched a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract with a total value of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta of entrepreneur František Savov.
In 2014, the Czech police charged him with tax evasion and are prosecuting him on the run.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is seeking his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of Aktuálně.cz.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade was to decide on the award of the contract 60 percent of the price offered and the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project.
It was Savov's company that was greatly helped by the second criterion.
According to the Dotyk.cz, it received 100 points in all sub-quality criteria.
This ultimately put her ahead of another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Mladá fronta operated with czk 404,900 per month, VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received a below-average rating from the assessors in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the Aktuálně.cz server under economia publishing house.
VLM has lodged several objections to the outcome of the tender, 1999, saying that its evaluation was unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it decided to challenge the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Office.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the public contract supplier on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favoring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," reads the application for the opening of proceedings filed at the Office of the Office of the OOC this week, published by Aktuálně.
According to the Director General and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee seems to be an untrustworthy and 100% evaluation of the Young Front project for all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors to be unlikely and suspicious," Klíma told Aktuálně.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are closed.
All information about the contract you have mentioned is published in the Contracting Authority Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin in accordance with the law.
"After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but we cannot comment on its progress during the duration of the contract," štěpán Dlouhý, the agency's media representative, Dotyk.cz the agency, told the agency.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that Economia had intervened in a competition where it had its own business interests through an article in Aktuálně.cz.
However, this fact was mentioned in that Article.
In the tender, she could be helped by the fact that she had provided editorial services to BusinessInfo in the previous four years.
The contract was first won in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was led by Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savov is accused by the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, causing alleged damage to the Czech State of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of ano movement Andrej Babiš, whose influence includes mafra publishing house, is behind his criminalization.
A London court rejected Savov's appeal against extradition last year, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not gone anywhere since last year, we have not received any notice from the United Kingdom as to the acquisition of the judgment," Štěpánka Zenklová, spokeswoman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to owning The Young Front, Savov was a company based in Harvestor Limited, based in Cyprus, which controlled the Samson brewery in Český Budějovice, and Maraflex, a Cypriot company that profiles itself as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
He should also control the bankrupt heavy machinery services company, formerly Legios, which owes over THREE BILLION CROWNS.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the transfer of assets from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker drove along the sidewalks and through the park, ending up in somersaults.
The biker attracted attention by driving recklessly on the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to drive her in the direction of The Post.
"The police pursued the man with caution through the city when he failed to drive on one of the side roads outside Marianske Lazne and drove his motorcycle into a field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
In the end, a rescue helicopter had to arrive at the accident and transported the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Eventually, officers discovered that the biker did not own a driver's license, the license plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his serial number was polished, and the license plate itself was removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"A breath test was carried out at the scene to exclude the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test revealed a positive result for methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will do nothing to disrupt Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris-Saint Germain in France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League.
Financial fair play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without heavy losses.
Barcelona paid €222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
This is followed by several financial terms of Neymar's transfer to France.
With PSG funded by a wealthy Qatari family who have become rich in energy sales, they can afford to bring Neymar into an already stellar football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums on buying players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overheads of football-related business activities.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after being appointed UEFA director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs in debt in the hunt for new reinforcements would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP's rules redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model roman abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spend huge sums on players to build a global brand - suddenly wasn't so profitable.
As part of the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to €30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Cheferin is determined to defend a ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future," Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid the amount for neymar's redemption in a lump sum, they can spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract for accounting purposes.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to €44.4 million a year for five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, which is owned by Abu Dhabi.
PSG were fined €60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to €20 million - and ordered to reduce the Champions League squad to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG as soon as the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the billing of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymar's income at PSG could be paid from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
However, PSG and World Cup 2022 officials in Qatar denied that Neymat should become an ambassador for the World Cup in football, and that such a maneuver would easily be detected by UEFA officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean THAT UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
Uefa has not opened any investigation into Neymar's transfer to PSG, according to insiders on Tuesday.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expect the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling jerseys.
The club expects to increase turnover by up to 30 percent from signing the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of their biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would break FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' by both the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari syndicate's ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports mogul, shares la liga's same stance on club funding.
"It's the result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"Once the club owner becomes a state, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan midfielder Rosicky: The changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomas Rosicky is going to the set.
Same scene as sunday's game against Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder started the game against Crvená Zvezdě, scoring several goals, but his teammates did not go black.
The flight team, pumped up with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, is out after the opening double-header of the European Cups.
Was it hard to do anything about the match after the Belgrade goal?
After the goal, we had to score four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted at least not to lose, to build our confidence, so that we had something to bounce back from in the next few games.
We had our chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the match for so long?
The game is very elaborate.
The combinations of the opponent were much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we shot like once at half-time.
Of course, that's awfully low when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into such positions more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes to the report?
Of course, it's one of the pains of forming a new team.
We've only played three competitive games and the lineup is constantly changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect 11 to sit down.
Is it encouraging that you've played parts of two games in a row?
It's still only part of the game.
I don't know how my condition is going to develop and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same as with an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has made a decision, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but left embarrassed.
What can you tell them?
There was again an amazing visit, as well as with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Do something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember visiting like that when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a cupless season at least be an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing, so it's not that much of an advantage for us.
An entrepreneur is to serve 10 years for extreme tax evasion.
The Constitutional Court rejected a complaint by businessman Jiří Toman, who is to serve a considerable amount of 10 years in prison for tax evasion.
The estimated damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
Toman argued in the complaint that the judiciary had violated his fundamental rights, and that the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were incomplete.
However, constitutional judges called the complaint unfounded, ČTK found from the court's database.
The ÚS is not another court of appeal.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess factual or legal misconduct allegedly committed by ordinary courts unless they constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the order states.
Toman was tried as an escaped fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was upheld by the High Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in extradition detention in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also present at the time of the decision of the ÚS.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The High Court has described the case as extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
From 2005 to 2008, the man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis.
The damage of CZK 645 million was incurred in the period January to July 2008 alone, the total leak exceeded a billion, according to the expert.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to sue Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, she paid taxes in only hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded are related to the entrepreneur Radomír Vyral, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison by the judiciary for vat fraud in fuel trades.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court some time ago.
"Summer to Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for characters from the famous 1980s; so for the dirty 1990s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter released the comedy sketch "The State" on MTV); and, of course, for modern times, namely 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd fled to bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a light parody and the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of enduring memories.
From the franchise's point of view, however, it looks like someone is running out of breath.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not just because of absurd humor (an example of which is the story of the emergence of a talking can of vegetables, named by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors moved away from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teenage kids - so they couldn't make fun of previous events.
The sequel to "Ten Years Later," in which adults play adults, doesn't push as much on an emotional level, and satire is at times sporadical, including parodies of 1990s thrillers like "Hand on the Cradle."
At one point, the character finds an Apple Powerbook, roller skates and "a lot of other things from 1991" on a pile of junk.
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still doesn't get over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention a crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), insudling George H.W. Bush (the very well-cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise are many side stories.
It's especially fun to watch the ever-young Rudd with long hair, aka Matt Dillon's character from The Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now an old pepper.
The franchise could be started by moments of random madness, such as the resugive "Seven Up" series, until it achieves what I assume will be a logical denouement: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the entire group will head to the premiere of "Years To Not Survive" in the final scene.
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to a different type of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of "Such Normal Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde: Without Regret," and even "GLOW," in which icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes collide.
Directed by Rhys Thomas, the comedy by brian gatewood and alessandro tanak is intended to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in a manner of Marxism-Leninism.
Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Street star as the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef, and Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (like policemen watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The show was voiced by many well-known actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on a clumsy propaganda drama - which includes a killer wearing a Reagan mask - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes is too long and comedy moments aren't enough.
With shorter footage, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose hall two fat men devour burgers stacked in a large pile.
The clear message to imaginary Communist audiences is that Western culture can turn everything into food and.
The thoughtful Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not get the IAAF's ban lifted.
At a congress in London, the IAAF International Athletics Federation confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian athletes due to a state-sponsored doping program.
The vote at the World Cup, which begins on Friday, was expected to go very clearly.
166 delegates voted in favour of extending the ban, with only 21 against.
The main reason for the rejection is, above all, that Russia is failing to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as rune Andersen, head of the IAAF Special Investigation Group, stated before congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, many suspected athletes have not yet been interviewed, and coaches with damaged reputations are still working in the country.
Russia's anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet World Anti-Doping Agency standards, is not yet fully operational either.
Rusada, however, can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, losing last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, among others.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming World Cup, who have previously shown that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start in national colours at the championship and will not play the Russian national anthem if they win.
Bank of England to keep interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following lackluster economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has fuelled speculation of rapid growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "on the back of" interest rate maintenance - despite the shoo-in of family budgets.
Policymakers on the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote for an interest rate increase supported lackluster economic growth, supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank forecast growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that family budget cuts would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that growth should occur over the next few years as a result of Brexit-induced inflation, and also said that rents on the financial markets should rise more than expected.
Committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package to boost the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result, the Term Finance Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, is due to come into force from next February, although the Bank of England said it would now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the Bank said: "The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household incomes and a burden on consumption."
On rates, the Bank said it would need to "tighten its belts on monetary policy" to calm inflation "to a higher degree" than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next, compared with 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
Projected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the estimates were published, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter, up from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although the bank said it should increase slightly towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is a slight consolation for households hit by rising inflation and mead pay rises. The bank said the situation would get worse before the increase.
The report goes on to say that monetary policy "cannot prevent" a reduction in incomes in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "significantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to the high interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which offsets the lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025% last August in response to the shock VOTE on the EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded a rate increase, along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households. Three policymakers called for an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, despite the Bank saying it expected such a change and inflation is expected to rise again over the next month.
The bank said the overshoot relative to the 2% target was "entirely" due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, managing director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only increase once lenders start competing for contracts with a view to a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those whose existing contracts and mortgages are ending - there are fee-free options on offer, as well as low rates that are gaining popularity."
NHS prescribes controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will get access to 'transformative' treatment to prevent HIV from September, following a High Court decision on nhs funding.
The National Health Service (NSH) in England has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to around 10,000 patients as part of a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the trial period after the Court of Appeal upheld a high court decision last year, saying the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP despite the statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was accepted by NHS England as a 'significant intervention' by chief executive Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and full implementation across England will take place by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV drug given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there are enough specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These drugs can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
The patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The programme will cost taxpayers £10 million and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute drugs after winning an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess prep's full potential, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: 'This important intervention should complement and fully nur the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in more than 30 years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: 'We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming England's HIV epidemic.
From September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to receive this statement.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we need to make it available to every patient.
We now have the trial drug PrEP at our disposal and are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.'
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the Government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of prep benefits.
It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and together end the spread of HIV in society.'
High-footed life: mezza and smart design have turned this small earls court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, swapped a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne smart terrace, it is an illustrable example of modern design that makes the most of the space available.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I came across this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away, and the same day I nodded to him."
Since then, the 1000 square meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mez floor to take advantage of the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
To that end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based design and design studio Duck &Shed and used a nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach the height of two gaps above each other - so the challenge for architects was to create a mez floor on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
"We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but also bending the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on each other - while adding to the drama.
On the icing floor, the beautiful living room overlooks the old copper window frames in retrouvius design.
Mirrored furniture in gold, silver lines and a retro Chandelier Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage areas equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to figure out the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced vealed door.
"The door is fitted with a counter-balance so that it is rolled away very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a living area - or an appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
"A real estate agent basically calculates its price based on living space when entering an apartment."
In this case, we managed to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
"Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
"You won't love the power grids in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they will not get your hearts."
As it turned out, high-quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you may ultimately choose to stay.
The United States is disconnecting.
The cultural and political divide between blue and red states is widening.
California has imposed a travel ban on its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and imposed a retaliatory ban on its citizens traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, US citizens are free to travel in all 50 countries.
It is that California has prohibited the use of state money to travel its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
Who's going to stop this madness?
California is strongly pro-LGBT and considers any expression of disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a conscience law under which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients is not obliged to provide it to them, but has a duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have embeed laws under which religious charities that receive children for adoption from mothers after birth are not required to provide adoption children to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscience laws, California has banned the financing of its citizens' travel to eight states of the Union with its own funds.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to scientific symposiums in Texas reimbursed from their universities, for example, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, in Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must earn either federal grants for travel, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund citizens' travel from State A to State B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee ran out of patience, and its House passed a bill saying it also dislikes California's policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits, and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
He's imposing them in retaliation for California's travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state in the Union that would order a similar travel ban on another state for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass conscience laws, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they are not allowed to do.
Secondly, what is wrong with a conscience reservation?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty, force him to sell pork when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In the state of Colorado, a baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or containing alcohol.
Why punish him and leave him alone and order the cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all federation citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policy in powers that are not federal according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California, and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California, and Texas, and seven other states to be California, too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and let live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but some activists seek not tolerance for themselves and others, but extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one must ever again show moral, religious, or philosophical opposition to the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I do not know the situation in American history where states have made such a decision on political issues, except for one case.
Even in times of struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where north and west were on the side of integration and the South was on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was in the 1850s, the political case was slavery, and the North's war against the South was about to take place.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between blue Democratic and red Republican states is widening, and the US is mentally disconnecting.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic was fined greasy.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
The court fined him for inviting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two large anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he wants to run for head of state in March next year.
The Kremlin's acting leader, Vladimir Putin, has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for inviting people to demonstrate through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary later," the Kremlin critic joked on twitter.
Russia's Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny cannot participate in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
But Navalny, who is considered an anti-corruption campaigner, considers the ruling politically motivated.
On Thursday, the court also imposed fines of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 rubles, on two members of Navalny's campaign team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are doing everything they can to prevent Navalny from campaigning.
In February, he was sentenced to five years' probation for robbing the Kirovles forestry business.
In May, the court of appeal upheld the verdict.
The ruling is so final, which under Russian law prevents Navalny from running.
Brothers fight for empire worth over $500 million
The two brothers are now in a schming over one of Victoria's most expensive properties, worth more than $500 million, more than four decades after their Italian family founded the empire.
Former Carlton Football Club ceo and developer Colin De Lutis resides on the Toorak estate, just three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who drove the dispute over joint property and business assets to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business back in 2014, but the bitter dispute continues to be disputed before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The family bought their first store in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 brick-and-mortar stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
Other properties have been bought with the money, and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, building land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who Paul says is the De Lutis family's "significant driving force and dominant figure," owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court documents state that Colin owns $316 million worth of real estate while Paul manages $176 million worth of real estate.
For Paul, it was the distribution of assets and funds that became a problem.
"Colin's motion was strongly in his favor in my eyes," Paul wrote in an affidavit in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also vying over who will control the existing business - from which He said Colin cut Paul off.
Colin contradicts that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement of some properties.
In a previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a possible resolution to the conflict.
"My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important thing," he wrote.
The cost of a trial is rising. Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers for both parties.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delis from the 1950s on and bought a shops in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money raised by building the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the family's first jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his senior year of college, Paul was just a little boy, about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped the transfer of assets to their sons would go well.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family's group of companies. Colin said Mark was compensated $10 million when he left and Luke $26 million.
As Paul put it, both Luke and Mark were "not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation."
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former afl club board member, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known TELEVISION personality and best friend of Colin, put it in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded via text message, edicing that, given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, "I have nothing to add."
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the matter to court," he wrote.
In a statement to the court in mid-2016, Colin said he was trying to adapt to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very dissatisfied to see our current situation," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a good solution."
On Friday, all hopes were in sight.
"Our disputes will be resolved in the near future by a court hearing," Colin wrote.
Heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Public transport drivers are fassing water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4, where about 35 children now come, they only go out in the morning.
The nursery is after reconstruction and planted trees do not yet provide a great shade.
There's no pool, but the teachers shower the kids in the fog room.
In the afternoon, children stay in classrooms where blinds are drawn and curtains closed.
They try to cool the air with an air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It's also challenging for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is both indoors and outdoors, exceeds the hygiene limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation during this period," said the kindergarten's director Miloslava Makovičková.
In the nursery there is a glass corridor, where, according to her, the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We'll unead the morning after 6am, the windows will close and we have blinds on the south side to protect us.
"But it won't help much," she added.
Better conditions are in the forest nursery Na Hrázi in Hostinice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have mature trees on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful walnut, there is a table under it, and there we do various things," barbora Kompanová, the kindergarten director, described.
Teachers try to go to the forest with the children, where it is more young.
Children's wet caps and various water games are on the agenda.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that's used for spraying flowers, and we use it to shower babies," Kompan said.
Jitka Vilimovská, the headmistress of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prosek, Prague, also said that teachers try to keep children in the shade and squirm them with water.
"We have a fairly mature garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3pm.
Every child must be under a headgear.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose a little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and in the garden they have a drinking water drinker.
Every day they also have vegetable salad and fresh fruits and vegetables for snacks, which are sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"For example, today a mother brought about 10 10-00 melon for children," Makovičková added.
Drivers are given water or a summer uniform.
Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
Tram and bus drivers' cabs are mostly air-conditioned, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to cabins, some trams are air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
So far, the tram tracks have not been seriously damaged by the high temperatures.
Minor damage occurred in a loop in Hostivar.
At current high temperatures, we pay particular attention to ensuring that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks at their disposal.
"Cooled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and road blocks," Řehková said.
In the wagons and at some alternate locations, employees have at their disposal sodobars, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic destroyed 108 of them, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day, when temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly busy fighting fire.
"There are fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with harvest work," said Nicole Zaoran, a fire department spokeswoman.
The evening's change in weather, when the heat was replaced by thunderstorms and torrential rainfall, did not bring relief to firefighters.
In connection with the storms, firefighters went out to 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian Region," zaoralová continues.
Firefighters were also needed in Stvolínek in the Czech Republic, where 60 people were evacuated from the children's camp due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures also added work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances went out to 10 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from karma.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling sagging.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infested room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media diet
Before him, many tried and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of President Trump's information - including tv news stories - in hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here's part of reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
"When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem for the Trump White House that he intends to correct: the meddly information that is getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told employees that he had to personally approve all information - whether on paper or on the spoken word - because the president could make a better decision based on the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth at trump's scrutiny and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching tv news is even stronger.
"If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by honest reporting, it was fitting to show him that a lot of other media outlets were talking about him in a positive light that were easier to convince," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets at bay - at least in the words of six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that praises him."
okay.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don't know - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't checked.
We will most likely never know about tweets that Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him at bay at least a few times, then their efforts did not go to waste.
But no one has been able to regularly prevent Trump from instigating controversial issues.
Part of the problem is that in a White House that consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by shoo-ins - which may or may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on advisers' tendency to submit dubious information to the head of state.
Here's an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that the president often reacts very an angryly to negative media reports, especially reports of leaks, and seeks to find their origins.
This happened in late February, when someone slipped the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being a 'source of many leaks' from the White House.
Notwithstanding the fact that Johnson was forever banned from Twitter for harassment; or that he has not supported his claim with any evidence; or that he had published false accusations in the past and later recanted them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "sought to implement a system to manage and document the information That President Trump receives."
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to pursue the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't just fade, and his aides are still vying for power.
These immutable factors will certainly make Kelly's mission worse.
Tourists negotiate trench and return to 'Millionaire's Quarter'
Several of the most amoous homeowners in The West Midlands are once again emusting with determined tourists negotiating with local authorities over the rights to reclaim the fields behind their homes.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field by a thriving street in solihull, dubbed the 'millionaire's quarter'.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being banished in May. Nor did they shy away from the trench, which was dug on the spot by order of the authorities in order to prevent their incursion.
The thoust group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the caravan field through an unprotected gap that served as a journey.
Angry residents of the district attacked solihull city council, saying it was 'unable to solve the problem'.
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: 'They occupied the site on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw rocks at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they have returned.
More arrived last night, and I think there's going to be more today.'
She added: 'Birmingham's board knows how to deal with this issue. He uses court orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook and I don't intend to continue paying taxes until the board has sedu tedust with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: 'It's ridiculous. Just recently, we were watching the last tourists leave, and now they're back.
And this time there are even more, and this time they brought horses with them.'
A solihull city council spokesman said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised stay on a property near Streetsbrook Road and are working with local police to take the necessary legal action to resolve the issue.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or unlawful behaviour to the police on 101.
This will give us an overall picture to be presented in court.'
The MEP's husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
A government special transported the injured Róbert Žitňanský to Bratislava just after noon on Wednesday.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight went smoothly.
Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels earlier this summer, according to TV JOJ.
He said he was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace of one of bratislava's hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from nova.
She would not comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians harden in fight against NGOs rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will stop the arrival of NGOs arriving on italy's coast with migrants from the Mediterranean unless ngos sign new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGOs do not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship from German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, making illegal immigration much easier.
The rescue organisation, which has been in operation for the first year, refused to comment on the case due to allegations made by the Italian public prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"For us, saving people's lives is and always will be the number one priority. So we are very sorry that we are not currently operating in rescue zones," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only comment on all current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the situation."
Italian authorities have been tracking jugend rettet's Iuventa ship since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on the ship, which were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place just 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to the prosecutor's file. The meeting was published by italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" to rescue operations.
For example, Doctors Without Borders (MSF), a Nobel Prize-winning organization, has also refused to adopt a new code of conduct.
Minniti, meanwhile, said that the sharp decline in migrants landing in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we have been beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also unveiled plans for further negotiations this month with Libya's mayors on an economic development initiative, as well as representatives from Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving the country in the hope of reaching Europe.
Shameless Mesarošová: Silicone and cellulite were coming out of her jumpsuit!
Hot summer days completely entice you to wear only the most necessary to cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarošová does it the other way around.
At an afternoon meeting at prague zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and everyone dealing with TV Prima was swarming, she covered her body in a mini jumpsuit.
And all it took was a few normal moves, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
The overall cut between her butthos many times, and he gave her a sauch so high that she had to keep adjusting it.
She certainly had no shortage of attention from the gentlemen and photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages insumbing Conrad Roy's suicide
A Massachusets woman has been sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide via text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months of a two-year prison sentence before serving five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father testified in court Thursday: "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left at large until a decision was made.
She was facing up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood in place at the sentencing with tears in her eyes, arms clasping and eyes facing the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
Carter's attorney, however, said they were "unfortunate circumstances that she deeply regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental illness does not have a significant impact on her actions."
The prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "Not a day goes by that I do not mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever," the statement read.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was "haunted" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be his children's aunt.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since I was born is a pain I'm going to carry with me for life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in force that penalizes a person who is helping to commit suicide. This case therefore sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in the backseat of a car in 2014, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted national attention after carter's suicide-inciting text messages were released.
"Maybe hang your way out of the building or stab each other," the text message Carter sent just two weeks before his death while Roy was on family vacation said.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she texted him, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter longed for attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. She was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox (30) posted a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
Audi adjusts up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just one day before Audi's announcement, car maker BMW said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes "there are more smart options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is bmw's headquarters - considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel atuomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of installing equipment to neutralize diesel engines is increasing, making it more difficult for cars to become competitive.
While German car manufacturers face careful examinations, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of pampering powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of audi's engine development department would have been arrested in Germany.
Former Zaccheo manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in a criminal investigation by German police into volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission limits - widened the charge Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can have a detrimental impact on Volkswagen: the luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred on Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told the SIC Noticias television channel that the plane was flying just above people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people on the beach reportedly fled the danger into the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead at the scene," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them alive, and the officers took them away for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are motorways in the Czech Republic even completeable?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unfinished, even though it started building back in 1978.
Even if it's unfinished, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the D11 motorway in Hradec Králové.
The construction of another section of it was newly halted for at least several months by the Children of the Earth movement.
We East Bohemians get the highway in pieces, like salami being cut.
The wheel will be cut, and then it remains to be seen when and if we will get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to reduce driving time and we want to get trucks going to or from Poland from villages and towns.
Endless streams of trucks go directly through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which there is no way around it.
But the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a knock since.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové began to be built recently, and on other sections to Jaroměř an archaeological survey began, with construction starting at the end of this year, you could hear the loud banging of corks in Eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week, it became clear that construction would not be built this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has filed a disintegration.
The children of Earth are repeating their tactics from D1.
They challenged the building permit decision in its entirety.
In their disassion, they request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the institutions concerned.
For example, the Hradec Municipality, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far we are coming down from the D11 near the village with the eloquent name Of The Undertaker.
So we're going down, we're just driving down the highway, and suddenly we're standing on a side road, and we prefer to get in the motorcade.
Worst of all, you see stories like this all over the country.
Scary, constantly clogged road to Benešov, D1 motorway or D8.
Everyone has their own Undertaker.
What do the Children of Earth demand?
What is the nature of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually un complete in the current system?

Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the south-eastern French region, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to dry climate and harmful insects, causing consternation on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at crieppam agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "Lavender cultivation in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the lifespan of lavender.
Cicades and grasshoppers carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in a dry climate are also to blame."
The stakes are high.
Lavender attracts tourists, and the oil produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of long and beautiful flowers grow smaller, under-developmental and often weak plants.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution may be to distribute water more efficiently and slow down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also to spray lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water, and to breed more species resistant to dry weather.
Journalist's murder highlights growing threats in Mexico
Riodoce weekly staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news of the unrest taking place in the Sinaloa region involving organised criminals, corrupt officials and ongoing drug wars.
Today, however, under the onslaught of recent events, it meets mainly for its own safety.
They learn that it is important that they change their habits.
Two deserving journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to name each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and hunch.
Choosing them from what - drug traffickers, politicians, traffickers and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - is a catalogue of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal behaviour.
Violence continues, and bodies pile up across the country; there is a growing number of journalists among them: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there have been at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug trafficking violence.
His loss is noticeable, although his presence is pervasive - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice" on which he points his middle finger hangs in the façade of the building; Two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, it has so far sued two suspects, according to a statement from the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime. Journalists' killers are thus very rarely court-martialed.
Journalists from Riodoca insist on informing about the violence taking place in Sinaloa; even though they are devastated by grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the hit-and-run and no vision of justice, the security meeting is pointless, Ibarra says.
"It's foolish to waste time on meetings like this," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, no one can be trusted."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce headquarters in Culiacán, sinaloa's capital.
He managed to drive a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the title of the article - which translates as Twelfth River.
The gunmen then got into his car and crashed it not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors seem to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzmán's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions try to fill the void.
Several people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with sculaged two-storey mausoleums for drug lords, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "truce" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), riodoce's co-founder and ceo, continues to blame himself for not defending his friend.
He believes two misconduct contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war on Joaquin Guzmán's sons.
Reconciliation could have upset the sons; suspected gang members bought all copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight against journalists by Mexican criminals.
He managed to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that would never change.
Noroeste was practically a veteran when he decided to sell his $50 stock in 2003 and start a business with five riodoce colleagues.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without mentioning the drug trade," Bojorquez said.
Riodoce eventually gained a reputation for brave and truthful reporting; the newspapers were starting to do well.
Journalists liked to search for problem topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated to read stories that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Committee award for his brave reporting on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I feared for my life," he said at the award.'
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is a "way of life," Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October last year.
"You have to take on the role of journalist - or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What were you doing in the face of death... Why didn't you say what was going on?'"
Riodoce employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his joking and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: was this routine to blame for his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions - how to do their job as best as possible and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you get involved with their wives, their children, clean shops, secret landing strips."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong here, hands off.
The problem, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be tricked... and then the Javier thing happened."
According to him, the old rules, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments, and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce employees meet; A few days ago, spyware was discovered, which was bought by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two police officers find relief from the 40-degree heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the Riodoce offices, located in a four-storey building in culiacan's burgher district.
Journalists are wondering if these police officers are among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials who the government says are corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists last went to mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's agenda.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio Caesar Chávez in Sinaloa.
They also have a light on suspicious government spending that took place in the governor's hometown of the state.
There have also been several recent kidnappings at one of Culiacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the state's attorney's office.
Officially, no one has announced the identity of the abductees or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were wary when they were about to write about what every resident of the city knows: that the restaurant is a popular destination for drug traffickers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of the political scene for almost the past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-level positions.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents at the restaurant, including one in which one of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzmán's sons escaped an army task force.
Until a month ago, readers would have read about the subject in Valdez's column, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender physique.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has been transformed into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists. The staff certainly didn't expect to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and set out the next morning to demonstrate outside the state's attorney's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western state of Michoacan.
Only a charred body was discovered. Authorities say based on DNA analysis, it's Adame.
The activity of journalists is intensifying across the country. Many of them organize protests and shoo nose at the sidewalks and buildings of the "SOS press".
The director of the Bojorquez newspaper is visiting Washington on a day when he is trying to gain international support and get justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of stalking journalists and telling the truth.
In the meantime, she requested a transfer to another department for fear that her anger might compromise her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "surrounded" by organized crime, corrupt officials, and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behow of politicians and security forces who work with organized crime.
Media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police officers and public officials for more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they want to shut you up," Ramirez added.
Apparently, murders work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages."
Next to the cut-off head lay a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to close, such as El Norte newspaper, based on the northern borders of Chihuahua state, in response to the march murder of the rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
Others are still going on, just as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the front page titled "What Do You Want From Us"?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling that you are constantly being persecuted.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruza.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their job, every day poses a great risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, that's why I became a journalist," he said.
It's midnight on Friday, and Riodoce employees are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - sipped beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people died in a shootout between gang members and police near a beach resort in the town of Mazatlán.
The war is intensifying, just as many of the messages left by members of the syndicate in the region promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on riodoce's website.
Not a day goes by, and the opening headline changes again.
The sounds of police sirens point to another gunfight.
Bojorquez glances at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Beneath the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middle finger is an eloquent slogan for all of Sinaloa - all Riodoce employees follow in his footsteps.
"How could we even think about leaving," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to put her out on the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
Researchers have now uncovered the conclusions of the first findings of an amazing creature the size of a rhinoceros whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts have called the 'Mona Lisa of dinosaurs' - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin and said the dinosaur had a 'troubled past'.
An article in the journal Current Biology stated that it is 'the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world'.
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. The dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described it as 'truly remarkable'.
According to National Geographic, the armored white-eater is still the best-left fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada, is behind the find.
He came across what appeared to be an alien object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to uncover the animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After finishing the work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
'All you have to do is turn a little blind eye and you'll believe he's asleep,' said head of work Caleb Brown and naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
'It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and well-to-do dinosaur species - the Mona Lisa dinosaurs.'
By studying his skin, researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - was most likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system used by many of today's animals.
Experts say this has allowed him to better blend in with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The cloaking system suggests it was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur of the Nodosauridae family first appeared in the paper in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who along with the team spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly well-to-do state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists documented the patterns and shape of scales and armor all over the body.
They revealed the method of camouflage commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising because Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
So it is possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation in survival.
Many contemporary animals with camouflage - for example, deer, zebra or armadillo - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus literally had to fight for its survive.
'The predation of the huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the danger posed by predators during the Cretaceous period,' Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was probably reddish-brown in color.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for other findings about its life, including preserved stomach contents, to track down its last meal.
They believe the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was carried to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The Alberta region had the same climate at the time as florida today, and rivers and oceans stretched much further inland than they do today.
'This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time preserved in three dimensions so that we can see its original size,' Brown said.
'For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as it did in the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just turn a little smy-eyed and it looks like he's just sleeping.'
In the Cretaceous period, giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, walked the Earth on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been a favorite prey of his equally fearsome ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe borealopelt's body was washed out to sea after being mummified in mud.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling at a Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada, is behind the find.
According to the museum, it is the best-living armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from mule to hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm barbs protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe this herbivore sailed through what is now Canada until it ended up in the river that washed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, 'finding such a well-heeled individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the St. Louis native sat down on her bed in an Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
In doing so, she came across a contribution from a high school student.
"Police have just shot and killed an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying in the street," it read.
She was surprised that no one else had written this post to her, so she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her posts on the wall.
The St. Louis rapper posted on Twitter about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying limp on the street, from where he was not taken after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone to go back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
She was watching photos of police tapes and people screaming. One of the men claimed to be the victim's father, holding a sign that said "Ferguson P.D. killed my unarmed son"!
She watched the live news - one of the policemen standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another officer, she said, was holding a gun that he pointed at the crowd, shouting, "I'm going to kill you all... animals.'
"That's not normal," Ferrell told her.
"This isn't the kind of murder we're used to and we can call normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
"I was angry and crying."
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described in the new documentary "Whose Streets?", which will be released in theaters August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and unymingness told from the point of view of people living in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell began a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headband - on a topic they had discussed many times before - "the experience of black people."
"Remember when I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalls of the interview.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old, and that's not right."
"There was no way I didn't take her with me," Ferrell said later.
"Today's events are the culmination...of events that have occurred in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grown into it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but she also had to know the difference between different layers of black experience and what we had to do to free us.
Even though I'm able to provide her with conditions in which she doesn't experience racism firsthand, she's no different from any other black child-woman.
I feel that if I could protect her from this experience, I would only harm her."
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road opposite the police department, which became a base for activists who expected officer Darren Wilson's words about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared food for others.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped deliver it to protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly being born.
"My activism was turned upside down after August 9," Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" ongoing events.
Ferrell, however, thought, "Are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story that can be used?"
This type of skepticism perceived into the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to capitalize on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an interview: "We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that."
Folayan has already established a collaboration with co-author Damon Davis, a respected local artist who deals with the subject of death row inmates.
Ferrell and six other locals who were followed by the "Whose Streets?" team in the years following Brown's assassination also participated in the project.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it's our statement," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the documentary was not aimed at focusing on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about the savior leader, but about community rapprochement," Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most open to participating in filming.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" thus describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face at the thought of the first moment she watched the final version of the documentary.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and humanize black people, I had to open up."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of an eccentric black woman in a broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who created a #BlackLivesMatter campaign in response to the 2012 killing of teenager Trayvon Martin on social media - call themselves weirdoes.
"Black eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately behind maintaining the movement," Ferrell said, "because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women."
However, she insists that "this is not just an affirmative action" and Ferrell is not the main heroine of the documentary because of her views.
"She was the driving force and power source," she said.
"that she is the one on the front lines is no accident, because life at these crossroads in the skin of a black weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television cameras have cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is serving two-and-a-half years probation for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
She described the social political atmosphere in what she calls home as "Disorder."
Yet she continues the effort she's committed to since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we have to lose are our chains."
There was a field on fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters rushed to the scene, and a helicopter helped.
Near Cesky Brod in Kolín, between the villages of Bela and Liblice, a field with an area of about 15 hectares burned from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 3:15 p.m., and firefighters issued a third-degree fire alarm out of four possible.
According to fire department spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, a helicopter also helped put out the fire from the air.
At 18:00, firefighters managed to put out the fire, the fire caused 700,000 crowns of damage.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters battled the flames at the scene.
The fire was caused by a technical fault in the engine compartment of the combine harvester.
A helicopter also helped put out the fire, which made a total of six waters.
"We handed over the place of intervention to the owner, until tomorrow 8:00 a.m. he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery are several faces of different skin tones - white, black and brown - suspended from the ceiling on wires. Each one of them looked like the last one fell out of their eyes.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from mouth swab and hair swab sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized wikileaks disclosure of classified cables.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning - a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before he left the post of US President.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual, commentary on dna's malleability - as well as the many ways DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, spoke from a young age about her being considered a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including violation of six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were being held by prison staff. Only one lower-quality black-and-white photo has been leaked, in which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in the platinum blond wig she is now associated with.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to Dewey-Hagborg's 2012 stranger visions project.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic items - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison, and they wanted to supplement the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visitors and photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, a few days after the comic was published, President Obama requested Manning's release, a welcome change after several unbearable years in a Kansas military prison.
Interestingly enough, the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war on people seeking to disclose government information and transgender soldiers as he tries to find new ways to incite resentment in areas he should support with his tweets.
In response to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything happens for a reason."
Under the artist's statement on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls out with her huge signature (the letter "i" in her last name is doped with her heart) at the end of "self-factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality, and culture."
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a centipede of the letters C, G and A recorded with a pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
"I hope that people will take away from this, that our genome doesn't care who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it their own way," Dewey-Hagborg said. Her 2007 work Spurious Memories on video is also on display.
"DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is a single page from the above graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emergeing king kong-like from united states disiplinary barracks with a megaphone in her hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they win," it says.
"Never be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - as predicted in the comics - but when she does, she will be greeted in the center of the room with her masks, her own genomic effits, lined up like a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded with a pencil.
"They've been placed on walls in the past, but this time I wanted them to radiate the feeling of a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted to create the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and frees her."
University of North West professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway these days for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted on suspicion of murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
A first-degree murder warrant was issued Monday for a man named Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, the Cook County Court filing states.
The document says Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Officers were alerted by phone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, the victim was found in one of the apartments with multiple lacerations.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide. Meanwhile, police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from the university's campus.
"The matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating fully with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been contacted by british police and are ready to assist the US police as well."
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole thing and wished he had turned himself in to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations for the Chicago Police Department, said he's urging suspects to surrender to the appropriate authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and efforts to track down suspects are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a call from the grand plaza building manager, who was alerted to the events that were supposed to take place in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught on security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza management released a statement to all residents: "Police are now working to compile a timesheet and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"We will complete the WADA plan in the near future" - Deputy Prime Minister mutko of Russia
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining Criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-edification of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented.
"At present, part of the criteria of the new plan has been finalised and RUSADA has already acquired the right to planning and testing in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of wada's plan to comply with the code - which describes rusada's renewal criteria - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutte, the code contains nothing to worry Russia about.
"Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented as well.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of these criteria calls for the public announcement by the government of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, about the government's alleged sponsorship of doping of Russian athletes.
On this subject, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation as our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All measures have been taken.
However, there were no state programmes in our country, so we cannot confess to something that never existed."
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russian RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: "On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSAD of emoting doping controls within Russia in November 2015 in the immediate aftermath of the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
After visiting the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Ceo Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "on track" to renew.
The police have charged three people, one of them juvenile.
Police have charged three men with setting up Wednesday's fire at a rare wooden church in Trinec-Guty in Frydecko-Misteck.
One defendant is a juvenile, all three are Czech nationals.
They face up to 15 years in prison for the offence of general endangerment.
The Moravian-Silesian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told reporters today.
He said it was an intentional crime.
"This is a very recent matter and the police are currently working on a motive for the matter," Cone said.
He said police would discuss the possible remand of the accused in custody.
Further information cannot be disclosed, according to the Director.
"That's all I can say right now, because the criminal police and investigation service and the state's attorney overseeing the matter are actually working on the matter," Cone said.
The wooden church of God's body in Guty came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, material damage will go into the tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance policy, the additional costs are prepared to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parishes, is also being prepared.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová was also destroyed by a fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by a fault in the wiring.
In its place, an exact copy was made.
The state counts on citizens to defend the state.
They'll support their training.
With financial support for associations usable in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the factual intention of the Law on the Readiness of Citizens to Defend the State.
The Ministry of Defence, which was tasked with its processing by the government, promises from it that it will be able to increase the physical fitness of czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This follows from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support conscriptness.
According to its authors, the basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the inhabitants of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the exercise of conscription and on the basis of voluntaryity.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of radio amateurs, shooters, or kynologists, and would allow their members to increase their capabilities.
In return, it would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the country's aid in times of crisis, and on their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and others in training or education.
It is also planned to organize meetings with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option is that a new office would be created to be in charge of project administration and coordination.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation should be voluntary and that the state would use their capabilities only after a state of emergency has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual wiping out of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the plan states, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the project is to create a very broad base that will allow each citizen to respond competently to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to perform their tasks by misconduct," the intention states.
Passing a law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen option.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
More money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also foresees that regional military headquarters would have to expand their scope, employing an additional 42 soldiers in total.
Ministry officials have previously stated that the law should also help to resolve the opposition of some Czech politicians to the introduction of a European Union directive on gun ownership.
Adopting it would allow shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons that the directive forspows.
Startups to help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but she couldn't find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even deceptive.
And despite promising anonymity for the survey, some employees expressed their distrust of the process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of San Francisco-based hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New human resources start-ups are constantly emerging on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intent to measure employees' obligations, startups allow companies to make quick votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer complete employee anonymity, and a complaints hotline, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass supervisors and contact directors directly.
"There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that track your health, but where's Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that Dglint has made her more aware of what her employees think and feel in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and team-specific votes, Glint offers a company temperature map and a cursory overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - allowing the user to work on the remedy.
Companies are beginning to realize the need to pay attention to the culture of the work environment - in case they become the next Uber - which is teasing in scandal after a former employee posted on his blog describing the corporate environment and harassing employees who dare to speak out.
For start-ups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, a website that looks at technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation, and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent, of Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Convercent's nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has also taken over its wings.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable "flash" surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and view temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
Where the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has empowered regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of convercent, a startup.
If a company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behavior - and if regulators do not act - it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, employee exhaustion, or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate executives.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, they had to find a phone number or email to the company's management, officially file a complaint, and hope for a good resolution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there had not been a reliable way to track employee complaints before.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it ensures that problems that have never been reached before by managers sitting in offices are ensured to be miles away from actually dealing with complaints - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment.
"It's close to a holistic, overall view of employee experience," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from lawsuits by employees."
Companies stopped taking ethics, values, and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed following enron's collapse over abuses of employee ethics, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until "social media lit up the whole thing" that companies began to realize that in the online world they couldn't simply hide their skeletons in a closet.
"Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity endorsed by bold capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent raised a total of $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital as part of its February campaign, eventually taking $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of researches clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to perceive that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
"If people are happy at their jobs, they feel that their voice is being heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money when a company is doing well and companies are thriving if its employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it's no wonder there are plenty of investors who will support that effort.
According to work culture experts, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is pointless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company requests feedback from its employees, big changes can occur.
And if the change does not happen quickly - at worst at all - it can provoke disappointment and lack of interest in employees.
"Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies relying too much on the data itself.
"Because once you've finished things, the employees start asking themselves, 'Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care?'" "
Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, can solve the problem within a day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After collecting feedback from employees frustrated by slow decision-making and communication quality, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the long run in an industry known for frequent layoffs.
"If you don't work to create a transparent work environment, employees won't trust you," Vitrano added.
"And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt."
Thursday became the hottest day on all.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic so far with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in the Hodonín region.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, not many temperature records have fallen compared to Tuesday on Thursday.
The heat mainly hit Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or evened at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations set a record.
In Strážnice, for example, today's temperature was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Lednice in the Břeclav region today, 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the heat was highest in Dyjákovice in the Znojmo region and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclav, where the mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, according to the CHMÚ website, today's highest temperatures have been only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures there only started to rise later in the afternoon," meteorologists said.
According to ČHMÚ, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade away, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
However, in most parts of Moravia, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We've had such a schmould.
Billionaires don't get the same vote in elections as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as brasy as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penta owner Marek Dospiva, together with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors Robejško's Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also chairman of his party.
The convicted corrupter and king of Czech gambling, Ivo Valenta, has acquired the Private Party.
The Agrofert political movement, as the project of Andrej Babiš was unkwnthingly named by the Mayor of Kromeriz Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter in itself.
The Mayors have also recently captured their billionaire.
It is Dalibor Dědek, owner of jablotron security equipment company.
In his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée in the mayor's jersey didn't do so well for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my aim is for the YES movement to win 20% of the Mayors movement in the elections.
Some people laughed.
But grandpa's overstep is rather characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of firm opinions.
Even though he intends to run for the mayoral vote, he continues to support Andrej Babiš.
The old man supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a seasoned speaker and does not rule the pleasing rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But he certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to do better personally.
For me, Babiš will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world under his control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn to imagine a possible cooperation with Babiš.
Some may appreciate that The Old Man does not change his mind and stands his ground no matter what jersey he wears.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending someone so clumsy to the Mayors to build his B.
Others may wonder if the boss of Jablotron, for example, broke up with the boss of Agrofert in a bad way in business and is looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
But The Old Man's first public appearances were not just about Babiš.
The old man promised to send ten million crowns to the Mayors' campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to pause for a similar statement.
Indeed, the court-recognized thug Zdeněk Bakala spent millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Vít Bárta, TOP 09 and the Citizens' Democrats together came to almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law forbids anyone from giving more than $3 million to a political party.
Now that Old Man is entering politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe then he wouldn't have to ask why politics has such a bad reputation here.
Dědek crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for a tax advantage for families with studied children.
People with a university degree come to about fifty thousand a month.
Those with a base of less than 20.
A man with 50,000 is rich by the standards here.
The one with the 20 poor.
In The Old Man's vision of society, the poor pay taxes fairly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of running a welfare state that they do not play much part in.
In short, the rich need to be helped not to work for poverty in need.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš can grind his hands.
The rest of us can confirm, thanks to Grandpa, that billionaires aren't good people.
The question remains who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not have their employees and country as their property as members of their party, or citizens and citizens of the state.
And finally, those who want all people to live well in a rich country, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The residential complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often even 11 bedrooms, spectacular sea views, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump will not help him.
When the Le Chateau des Palmiers residential complex was sold, the price went down by a whopping £8 million.
He informed the website of Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says of the property, "Sincerely, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the real estate company's association with the US president did not justify an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean mansion by a whopping £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, with the final price falling to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And no wonder.
The stunning 5-acre mansion on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full-size bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also features a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palms are planted on the property.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price reflected the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around £15 million.
He was supposed to buy the property for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new price, however, it ranks second.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5m.
The NCAA has decided to end two workouts a day. Long days are coming for the Bruins
As the 11th morning approaches, UCLA's American football players are squeezing on the sidelines of a new school field.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal sweaty backs, an unlausing sign on the first day of training camp.
For most team members, these few minutes of doing nothing are a supplement to the lunch break.
Players signed up for the summer semester will go to their rooms after a three-hour workout to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting at 6:30 a.m. the following morning.
"These guys are going to be hard work for the next three days," Bruins Coach Jim Mora said moments before Monday's game.
By eliminating two workouts in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players - paradoxically, it's even longer training days - at least until Friday, when the finals end.
That's why UCLA's first three practice sessions are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. - to cram into the already crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in Mora's six seasons as coach at Westwood, bruins training camp begins a week earlier than last year, and practice is limited for the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of workouts from two to one per day also has an impact on this.
A total of 18 workouts are scheduled until August 20, before formal preparations begin for the first game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's decision, despite adding another item to an already busy player's diary.
"For three or four days, players are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
"But no one gave up, everyone's trying. They're great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after training camp, which will not be easy to see the clear lines of surrounding grounds from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center Hotel, which was occupied by players after harvesting the safety net behind the goal post.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
"Safety is taken care of, but it is possible that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
Such material is well traded.
Luckily, the hotel will be guarded by security, as will parking lot 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will be all right.
Everything is planned."
Facebook plans more thorough fact-checking to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles for review to third parties and display the findings under the original posts in an effort to combat so-called "fake news," the world's largest social network said Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company says it will begin using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes that it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed messages influenced last year's election of the President of the United States.
Political debates are being waged in Europe on the matter. French voters are inundated with an avalanche of fake news about May's presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of september's election if it does not quickly remove angry posts.
Facebook said in a statement issued in Germany on Thursday that it plans to launch testing for a new fake news review feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying third-party verified messages, people want more content to be better informed and make the right decision about what they can share," Sara Su, Facebook's product manager of news, said on her blog.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Making a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
The small Scotney Castle recently starred in squeeze's music video, and Margaret Thatcher also found refuge there during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scotney, however, witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy place by the River Bewl in Kent, England, which inspired the curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of YorkShire - known for his penchant for historical documentations - to create a graphic novel.
"The sight of a man who is 300 years dead fascinates me," rhodes says with a straight face.
"When I hold a letter in my hands, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But it's not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he's also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by British Library documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jakobits," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone so fascinated by old papers, the support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility of staying in the castle for almost four months is almost like a dream. ("To tell you the truth, I've extended my stay a little.")
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on the wall and bottles that had been dumped in a ditch for centuries.
He walked around the grounds exploring the ruins of the old castle, talking to gamekeepers, gardeners and occasionally artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night, he "drank whiskey and wrote."
Scotney's confidential history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained access to documents in 2006 following the death of its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site 10 years later, employees were only just beginning to infiltrate the archives, which Rhodes described as "aristocrats of many centuries throwing their hands around saying, 'Take it to the attic'."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps depicting property: "You may think a land dispute is boring," Rhodes said, "but I came across one case where two families were tussling over birch.
Stop it, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Uprising of 1381.
"I found a record of a musing on the castle in 1380, which was called knightly families of Kent and Sussex in the book," Rhodes said.
"The English uprising actually began in this area, and I thought rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected after all."
Other stories are firmly linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was only discovered a few years after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes' favorite family is the Darrells: "I was intrigued by the male generation - men of the time were always in debt and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family dealt with this by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to be behead heiresses."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is looking for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stit in the Finnish wilderness, where he soaked inspiration for his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was engulfed in nature.
But it is a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought, 'Now I'm going to get the hell back to real life'."
Washington changes green card conditions
The media has published President Donald Trump's words about the new US immigration plan, which will also change the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is projected to fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on the issue of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers. We will do this by changing the rules on issuing green cards to the inhabitants of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will prioritize English-speaking applicants who are abounding in funds and will show skills that will benefit our country," Trump said, as quoted by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on the look out
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn't be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots appeared online.
yes.
Sex robots are really popular these are.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
In the words of former Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots must be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People are make fun of them, but sales are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them more and more," Sharkey said at the news release.
Modern sex toys are changing from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course there is artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot in his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
What is very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own "personality" that would shame even stepford's little woman.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set different character traits for his surrogate wife, among them shyness.
And then there's True Companion's Roxxxy Gold sex robotic woman, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the "frigid Farrah", who is characterized by a shy nature, and the "wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" character.
"The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to suit your personality as much as possible," the True Companion website reads.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkal or "in the mood."
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - including the substantive interpersonal relationships. More disturbing are the inferior female character traits and violent innuendo - such as frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
True Companion likees Roxxxes to a male vibrator on its website.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" the page says.
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a sex aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or sexual equality towards a desire for captivating sex with an optional mark-up.
Of course, most men don't buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the general public's interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set up in modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until the free market gives them an excuse to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights, and there is a president sitting in the White House who often speaks very derogatoryly about a woman.
The most horrifying aspect of The HandyMan's Story is not what we see - hanging bodies and hollowed-out eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The book The HandyWoman's Story is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should, as far as possible, resemble real women (albeit with actress rates).
Their creators design them to be pleasant to the touch and to look like a real woman at first sight.
But when it comes to their "personality", the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job, no history. Nothing to incite their independence or erode their devotion to their master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
21st century language: maids.
NBA star on green chives.
Curry's fighting for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry didn't get lost despite a botched first hit in his first start among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA MVP award winner played the first round of the 74-shot Web.com Tour At the Ellie Mae Classic in Hayward, California, and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, got off to a nervous start, his first hit ending in a beverage holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even then, he wasn't as accurate between holes as he was under a basketball hoop, but he left behind a dozen pros with a four-shot over par record.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first hit, but then it kind of seduated," Curry said, noting that he had a lot of stage finge.
It was very nervous to hit the first shot of the tournament, but it was all I was hoping for.
"If you told me I was going to play 74 in the first round, I would take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight his way through a cut that is likely to be two shots under par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of my stage fem0, I think I can," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
Hayward is starting for the first time at a PGA tournament.
He received a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
Against that, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
Political divisions are becoming an unencepted feature of the Trump era, dividing American voters and also tearing apart entire families on a micro-scale.
Over the Christmas and Thanksgiving periods, american newspapers were teeming with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for our nerves to loosen.
But less attention is paid to Trump's ability to bring the family together.
I'm talking about this because my cousin - a poet and fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has long been a Republican fool in our family - visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that being together in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly the whole family - including all the Republican siblings with whom she has bickered about politics for years - is on the same page.
It's a good thing at dinner at the family table; but I am puzzled that, in a broader context, this poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we are talking about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the frightening possibility that his antics may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more gruesome long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-right Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what can be called rational.
In these today, I remember with nostalgia in my heart Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax returns) - both of which look like very minor offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump leaves, it will be enough for the subsequent Republican nominee to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visit and took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel operated by the New York Parks Department - for your $3 you won't find a better use unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed looking at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy look, and the tinkly music is oddly reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés soon get old: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panora looks instead of breathing the atmosphere on you, and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not really Swiss cheese - not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage theme pub - but London Underground station.
The Central Park carousel, however, evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the point where two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, have a great time on it.
If I could rate the carousel, he'd deserve the maximum points. Fortunately, no one asks.
I had a similar experience in the store this week when I was asked to evaluate my "experience" on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
It's the same in a café on the corner of my street, with the difference that I can tip 15% on the rating for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to intrude into the favor of shoppers when it is not needed.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile as I reluctantly rated my five-star credit card transfer.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to his wrist that the prison said he inflicted on himself after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing his original manslaughter conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp with multiple gunshot wounds through the door of a toilet cabinet at his home in Pretoria in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013.
Pistorius said he mistook her for a thief.
Prosecutors announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they said was too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to south Africa's supreme court and a trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces up to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive panda cub was born, mated in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of captive pandas.
Zhang Zhong, a staff member at the center, told the New China News Agency that panda breeding is at high risk from kinship crossings.
Only 471 pandas lived in captivity at the end of last year.
Only 2,000 of them survive in the wild.
The effort to mate captive pandas with wild ones is thus the first step towards helping to protect the species.
Fifteen-year-old Cao cao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on her neck, scientists were able to observe her every move.
Cao cao met her chosen one 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and ended successfully.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, since panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males quite poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, bTV quoted the statement as saying.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
All were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and impose severe fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
The inspections will take place throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilková is 50th after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilková ranks 50th after the first round of the British Open.
The course in Kingsbarns, Scotland, went one stroke under par with three birdies and two bogeys.
The 22-year-old Czech player thus has a chance to make the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entering the $3.25 million contest went best for American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round with a course record of 64 shots, or eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands alone has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch food safety authority NVWA said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which it said meant that 80 percent of the eggs on the market were safe.
The Authority stressed that only a limited number of egg types, recognizable by specific numbers, pose a risk.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Petr Majer, a spokesman for the Czech JRC, said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also moved to close their farms, have not recently been imported into the Czech Republic.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chickens originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets problem brands of insecticide have appeared.
Eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands last in May, according to the veterinary administration.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
However, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance that is usually included in preparations against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO considers the preparation to be mildly toxic.
Its high doses lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss her, says goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch for ten more years.
"Maybe one day I'll go back there," said 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in a Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets an engagement by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like I did at school, it'd be three.
I didn't catch much in the first year, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year, I started catching.
Before the third season, I thought they were going to give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, with whom I took turns again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch all the time.
But in the opening 10 games, we only got five points, so the coaches started shooting it.
By the end, my colleague was catching more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play him for next season.
How was life in Riga?
gorgeous.
It's little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm going to miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We've been together for three years, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How demanding is KHL for goalies?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or the Slav, who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more back, fighting harder.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the field.
The difference is, the Russians want to play empty.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic after all.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can get some sleep.
The program is usually made so that you play, say, four games outdoors and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians even perceive their club in the KHL?
Like a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
Everybody's cheering.
Even when things weren't going well, a lot of people were coming.
Did Dinamo's time in the KHL help latvia almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time, their World Cup results started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell just 1-2 to Canada in the quarterfinals.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they've reached the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts made his mark in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs before signing.
Why do so many of them come here?
They're not B players, they're really good quality.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still out of commission?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
That's how we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't make a cut.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the finals they decided on someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín, waiting for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about this?
That was four years ago when I left here and I didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it another way.
The only question is when and where I'm going to sign.
How real is the possibility that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
Let's see what happens in a month, where what goes wrong.
Now all I can do is wait and see what the agent has to say.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season wasn't enough for me to choose from.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's fling at Let continues.
In January of this year, I am in the article With the care of a proper manager? he also wrote about the camp in Years near Orlík.
The nature of the problem remains the same, so I would like to recall the key passages of the article.
The camp in Let has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it is probably best to look at the official website of the cultural monument Reverent Place Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical review, they learn that the camp was two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labour camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2 August 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The following describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first flight prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 in total.
A very sad history of the immense hardships inflicted on them by human beings and perverted ideologies.
There is no doubt that these events need to be constantly remembered.
There is also no doubt that the commemoration should take place at the memorial at the place of these people's suffering.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was forgotten a bit, and in the 1970s a sea suction was built nearby and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, and in 1995 a memorial was unveiled in Let.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and demolish the seed, but so far it has not.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the prison.
So briefly the facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was only last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pouch and decided to have an expert opinion drawn up to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the farm.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "there are some numbers, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it's not going to be cheap.
And yet, just a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is probably not the case, I think it would still be a waste of money.
Doesn't the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified place of reverence, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that took place, and anyone who wants to can pay their respects to the suffering and murdered here.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is and keep the place of reverence with the utmost care.
The entrusted assets, including taxpayers' money, should be treated by the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, with the care of a proper manager.
At least with the kind you do in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above, I see the ANO leader's motto only as empty pre-election proclamations.
This May, I went straight to the site.
Very decent driveway, landscaped parking lot, replica wooden camp houses.
In one exposition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
Small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own reverent place, which is made of stones located on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as befits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway on the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider, for example, whether part of the uncovered foundations could be preserved and at least visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
Culture Minister Daniel Herman could make his effort in this direction.
If he succeeds in pushing through the government's purchase of a seed with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic tenure as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote bowel resistance.
Study leader Dr Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the degradation of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
As soon as the scales tilt to the side of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
As part of the research, scientists found the presence of immune cells promoting body tolerance in the stomach of mice with a specific bacteria.
This bacterium requires the presence of Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophan mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if the same proves true for humans, then the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
In a study of a kind of immune cells that promote body tolerance, postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice kept separately lacked cells.
She inferred that one group of mice had a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungs that commonly dwell in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of mice were tested using the DNA sorting method, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that were missing from a second group of mice.
Mice that were brought up in a sterile environment and lacked an intestinal microbiome - so they did not develop this kind of immune cells - were given the L. reuteri bacteria - and developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grown L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to under-development immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the fluid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. At the same time, the number of cells decreased by half after half the doses of Tryptophan were halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of Tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the cell population.'
Jose Mourinho considers signing Nemanj Maticic and his move to Manchester United 'brilliant'
Manchester United have acquired a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed for £40million, made his first start in a 2-1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, having not taken part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matic was out of form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said needed to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mindset - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in good condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new team-mates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his 11 for next season.
An independent source reported this week that Mourinho still wants to sign three other players, but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" bringing three of the four most important players into the squad.
"I thank the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
"Four out of four would make me more happy, but I admit they've done their best for me."
The life challenge of the king of chicken cutics, Ládi Hruška.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promise picture began to loom thanks to a new show on TV Prima Zdeněk Academy.
Pear immediately smicked at the chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to join your cooking academy because I think I can get a lot of lessons from you," he said in a video on social media.
And since the two of them have been at each other's toes for several years, He didn't forget to irritate him this time.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo from dietary chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you out for water and show you why fried cheese is popular," Pear pokeed.
He's serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to take it to the next level and get away from the master.
"The question is, what does the boss say," he told The Flash.
Pohlreich didn't comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to Hruška's participation in the culinary academy, saying that she took the whole thing as his personal activity, which goes off-TV.
Pear dealt a big blow to Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cookbook.
In a matter of days, she sold over 300,000 units!
The new show, presented yesterday by Prima at a press conference for the autumn broadcasting scheme, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from among the audience and introduces them to twelve culinary techniques in twelve episodes.
In the last episode of his show Now Cooks Boss in November 2014, Zdeněk had a crossed pear ironed on the back of his shirt.
If he had my face in there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'm just going to smile over the pear - pear is a healthy fruit and it has a lot of vitamins," said Láďa.
He thinks his way about Laďa's culinary art.
"Cooking according to Láda Hruška is not an option even at home, because I will not let gastropunk go home," says the boss.
I have great respect for Zdeněk Pohlreich, I even make chicken on honey according to him.
But his recipes won't appear on my show," pearce said.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook to me, he's a TV clown.
Gastronomic analfabet or, Pohlreich said of Hruška in a lecture.
"I'm not 20 years old to wave my hand at them, but I don't deal with them anymore," Hruška said in the account of the insults.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock car and house with wave
A British inventor has become the first person in the country with a microchip injected into his body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door to the house and office and even start the car.
Steven Northam, 33, had the tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forearm and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
Dr Geoff Watson, an anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the implantation and follow-up process.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a microchip-compatible door and car lock replacement service. The price of one castle is £300.
The married father-of-one had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wave of his hand.
White House prop cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry last month came at $24,000, according to Navy records released by TIME.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of a July 17 program at the White House that showcased U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials surveyed product shows from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forklift from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the helicopter's presence less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn as part of an "emergency," marine helicopter squadron one (HMX-1) - the unit in charge of helicopter management - said.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such an important event," hmx-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy's deputy commander for aviation the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7:00 a.m. on July 17 for the parade, which is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. and will remain in place until the entire site, which was scheduled to be completely evacuated between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
The email also said that if there is a delay in leaving the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to working time regulations.
The original crew remained at the scene that evening along with the helicopter, along with a unit of security personnel.
The footage - obtained by TIME Weekly - did not show whether a second crew was eventually dispatched.
The Hatch Act prevents state officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible violation of this regulation.
"We wondered if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were assured that everything was in order," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you've been blocked," the deputy commander wrote back.
This "Made in America" parade was designated an official event by the White House, and the Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political overtones.
As he attended the event, the president pushed for health reform, which passed the Senate, and spoke of trying to rein in government regulations.
The use of air vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the president's plane was flying in the background at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is flooded with complaints about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is pleased with the 'Made in America' parade, which showcased products from all 50 states that Americans make from American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train to land in the Washington area and on the South Lawn, rehearsing possible arrivals with the President of the United States at the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump was attending the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the current crew training, a state official said.
On the same day, a helicopter unit flew another 11 hours as part of "non-resident support missions."
The White House said no other props were covered by taxpayers' money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company had no involvement in the helicopter's display negotiations on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the parade is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, DoD reimbursements for VH-3D expenses are $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records show a time of 30 minutes from marine corps air facility quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"It's very misleading to list taxpayers' expenses based on estimates of reimbursements," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs."
According to a 2015 RAND study, reimbursements of DoD expenses do not include personnel costs, but include fuel price, maintenance, and contract costs.
Then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the parade.
"The idea of this week's show is to introduce products made in the U.S.," Spicer said.
"I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state, and that they provide work to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military installations that countless American citizens are involved in making.
This is a fact to be recalled."
It's unclear if Trump was on his way to the South Lawn to see the helicopter. The only thing that can be said for sure is that he got behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump addressed a Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I own three myself."
A young woman got stuck in a swamp at Mácha Lake, and the police waded towards her.
The girl set off for the beach about 2am on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask a police officer for help with her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, the police soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols rushed to the scene, which she described, but finding the young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the policemen had to wade through the reeds of the wetlands hundreds of meters before they could feel solid ground under their feet," Baláková said.
And so was missing.
The officers were oriented according to which direction her cry for help was coming from.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her to count down aloud," the spokeswoman said.
Police didn't find the woman until 3:30 p.m. in the swamps of borny.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of under-cooling.
That's why the ambulance was called and took her to the Hospital in Český Krumlov.
The old man's connection to STAN?
The coveted bride becomes a marketable girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project hledameslusny.cz as if the billionaire was basically telling voters that STAN was suffering from a deficit of decent people.
He also confirmed that a politically disparate group of lesser-known mayors and independents actually had no national agenda for the House elections.
Her election candidate will simply be a decent man after interviewing The Old Man, whatever his political opinion.
Vít Bárta used to start like this and it didn't go very well.
Moreover, with his hunt for decent people and personalities, who will eventually replace some mayors on the list, as Gazdík admitted, Dědek also cancels the STAN chief's popular argument that the biggest value of the movement is precisely politically vetted and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians even according to surveys.
They will now be replaced by hastily collected unknown personalities.
Gazdík also explained the total break with the People's Party, after which STAN changed its logo and slogan, by saying that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the people's list.
But if few suspected STAN of identity then, after the arrival of The Old Man, the game of identity ends.
Not only Gazdík has long opposed Andrej Babiš's ANO, but at the first joint press conference, Dědek, who publicly praises Babiš, stated as follows: "My goal is that the YES movement, i.i. the Mayors movement, will gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't confuse the movement.
The old man is a successful businessman, and the billionaire is certainly no accident.
He often talks about politics in a similar way to Babiš, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been more of a reality show than a real political party for some time, and Grandpa's helping hand has made the coveted bride even more of a marketable girl.
For a while STAN went with TOP 09, then with the People's Party and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone calls.
Police dogs practice helicopter crossings in Most
Dogs specialized in explosives detection and search dogs practiced helicopter crossings at Lake Most today.
A police dog must not be timid and afraid of flying, said Petr Tomášek, head of police kynologists of the Ústí Region.
Training a police dog takes about two years.
At Most, both adult trained dogs and those who are still undergoing training trained trained.
In addition to standard training to detect sharp explosive samples around the lake in search of a missing figure, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work so that he does not have a problem with the helicopter journey.
"The helicopter comes, the dog goes and searches immediately," Tomášek said.
A dog that is restless or is unable to start working immediately after a helicopter journey is excluded from training.
"Usually dog handlers leave them in the garden, for example," tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the Ústí Region.
German shepherds are prevalent, but Belgian shepherds are also growing.
The handler takes care of him from a puppy.
"He raises it himself, prepares it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which can reveal possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and unassuited, it takes its first tests at 20 months.
"He's been getting into a sharp hit for about two and a half to three years," Tomášek added.
The length of service in the police depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They live mostly with their handlers.
Narcos Season 3 trailer: Pablo Escobar out of the picture as Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of Netflix's hit series

The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, a senior official at the U.N. Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women are taking part in local council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate, as well as all related processes related to elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have made several threats against the electoral process, which is shifting international combat activities to the other side.
In this year's elections, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government is handing over its power peacefully to the next government.
Haysom said a strong role for women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The unique brewery brews beer again.
For a good beer at the resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobč near Mšena to life a few years ago.
The brewery, first commemorated in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was converted into a steam engine in the nineteenth century.
Years of heyday followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during The Second World War, production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationally nationally nationally.
Since then, the buildings have served the state farm.
The work of destruction was perfected by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, a new hope was raised in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouza.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have carefully devoted themselves and devote themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery is in the same form as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded by the Declaration of the Brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building also became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, they also inaugurated the tradition of brewing beer.
If you want to taste great Lobeč beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínsko, visit the bar in the brewery area.
When brewing beer, they use kokořín water springing in a protected landscape area, malt from lobeč fields and Žatec hops.
In the bar you will taste traditional light lager, as well as dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the brewery tour, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and 12.30pm.
The largest artillery stronghold in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type worldwide?
Such a unique structure was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žaclér, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
It was originally intended to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by a large underground.
This was supposed to be headquarters, barracks, ammunition depots, materials, power plants, engine room and hospitals.
However, the Munich Agreement ended construction.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who started to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also visit here.
The underground is already 75 percent accessible!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with exposition and underground, the complex also includes an armed building of light fortifications, two infantry cabins under construction, trenches and the Fortified Trutnovsko nature trail.
Refreshments, cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been listed alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's Port near Rome or the Assyrian Palaces of Nineveh and Nimrud.
Monastery Chotěšov originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged building of the convent above a beautiful garden.
The list he got on, but unfortunately belongs to unique constructions that are in danger of disappearing.
However, enthusiasts do not want to give up and hold a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is another year of the Evening for the Monastery of Chotěšov this Saturday, August 5th, where vladimír mišík, Ivan Hlas will perform, you will see fencing performances and you will look at the places of a beautiful large building, which are usually inaccessible.
But most importantly, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look neanderthals in the face?
The exhibition Welcome to neanderthals in the pavilion of the Anthropos Moravian Museum in Brno invites you to an extraordinary excursion into the deepest prehistoric period into the Stone Age, the world of our predecessors.
You will find out how Neanderthals managed to cope perfectly with various extreme climatic conditions, especially the alternation of ice ages and inter-ice periods.
Despite their simple material culture, predators of their time were extremely successful.
You will also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy, technological skills and hunting skills were like, but also their aesthetic seeding.
You wouldn't say that to neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The 14th KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival takes place on Saturday the fifth at Veveří Castle.

Chef Miroslav Kalina will cook, you will taste culinary specialties and regional food, enjoy musical and dance performances, a rich program for children such as creative workshops, theatre, bouncy castle, Smurf Competition Path and, of course, a number of competitions.
Get to know the plant in one click.
Students with herb formation as well as ordinary plant lovers will be helped by a new free Pl@ntNet.
If they're wondering what plant they just came across on a walk, this app will advise them.
All they will have to do is photograph the plant, and the application itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for both iOS and Android, was unveiled on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education in Bratislava's Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
Pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also participated in the project, who with teachers photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was for as many people as possible to contribute their images to the application, the increasing number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Even children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest," said ivana Poláčková, coordinator of this project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of a plant, the application can recognize its name in seconds, which it then assigns under the photo in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the Project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute a snapshot of a plant that is not yet in the database after opening an account to the application.
"The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková informed.
GMB concerns over investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is seeking assurances from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's about a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Gmb Scottish Trade Union said the company remained silent for the time being about a possible investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory has more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said it had invested more than £5 million in the area over the past few years.
She added that union employees and representatives would be "among the first to be informed" in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the company's construction manager, the Scottish GMB union expressed its concern that McVitie's "will not deliver on its promises to finance and modernise production lines."
GMB chief organiser Drew Duffy added: "The fact that we have not received a clear response from the builder on the needs of the company and the future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in the local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social separation.
In terms of work, pay and benefits - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and declining slow production - the east end of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie's."
A Pladis spokeswoman said: "Tollcross's construction manager only received a letter from gmb yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the continued commitment to union staff and representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and there were many issues openly mentioned at that meeting.
We have spoken to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested £5 million in tollcross, particularly in production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the locality and in the event of any changes in the operation of the local factory, employees and trade union representatives will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to join their side after they paid £189m, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but has this French team warned Barcelona of their record-breaking raid three years ago?
This sensational transfer has s heating up the waters of summer transfers. The Ligue 1 club are poced to surpass the previous record for Paul Pogba's £89m move to Manchester United last season.
Once the transfer is confirmed and completed, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world - after tax he will receive over £500,000 a week from PSG.
Barcelona are outraged at the way Neymar has been released from his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed their interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned any club interested in taken on one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried, because if someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll definitely reach out to one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to acquire one of our players, they will face consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed an imaginary line by expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian national team to leave under any circumstances. It is possible, then, that Barcelona are now swallowing a bitter pill for their audacity in dealing with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understandable rules?
Donald Trump nodded to anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump had written that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it would not go on like this.
Even from this, the idea of sanctions smells like straw from shoes.
You can't put these things in one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela has really set off on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not just beying the way the US President would like.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if one wanted to sum it all up so that even the average voter, American, European, or other, could understand what it was about and what system of rules the policy of sanctions relied on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely tightening what President Obama has already prepared, only to give it an implementation stamp.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump won the US election, he would hug Putin and lift sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not relaxing, but tightening.
But Europe is even more terrified.
German Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
You mean kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission Chief Juncker, for his part, complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean sanctions are supposed to be applied weak enough not to put anyone at risk?
The average voter is in the dark.
For three years, he has heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
Now he is told that this is about the EU's energy security.
The voter is also more broad.
Russia is being sanctioned for being too mounted where it should not be.
China is scolded for not installing enough.
Venezuela's president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All these punishments or considerations have rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, order or rule?
Andrej Babiš: I am not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš is married, crisscrossing the Republic with his visionary book and finalizing the electoral programme.
In addition to the Pardubice Region, he has already finished all the candidates.
In his words, he did not interfere with them significantly.
He even agreed to have Ivo Vondrák, the Governor and Shadow Minister of Education of ANO, lead the Moravian-Silesian one.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member of parliament or a governor," Babiš confirmed his earlier position.
You have angered many councillors and national politicians with your thess that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the president directly, and I believe that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
I'm not talking about abolishing the deputies in my order.
The question is, how many will there be?
When I presented your book What I dream of when I happen to be asleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about abolishing councils.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct elections and a reduction in the number of representatives.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 deputies.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1,171 representatives.
And the mayor is blamed for not building enough and not putting in the right place for big projects, but she doesn't have the authority to do so.
The same is true of a government that has only been governed by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it right.
But the current Prime Minister doesn't control anything, he just moderates the debate.
That's not how it's going to work.
Is that why you want to push through a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to enforce.
All we have on the agenda is a one-round vote for the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the Rules of Procedure of the House in order to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of Members, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to show off at meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destruct the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the House with 101 members, abolish the counties and the Senate, and control the entire country through grateful mayors and mayors.
I'm sure it's not like that.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction of a third of the legislature, with 57,000 French per legislator, compared with 17,000 Czechs in our country.
But Macron is not accused of endangering democracy.
Even if someone wins the elections by a majority in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
But the seducts for those with parliamentary major majories are great, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such threat in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team that will work for people in government, not for our parties or departments.
I do not understand, for example, why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services will be increased.
Why did they outsmonch me and add 21 percent to gibs who are already taking 60,000?
Would you step on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when ministers behave inemously, confuse the government with a travel agency, and with the money of the state they would like to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers in government are not supposed to argue, they have to resolve differences outside of it.
There has to be finished material in the cabinet, there is no room for coalition squa ching, power voting and business, where decisions are to be made.
How do you want to have a coherent team when ministers are mainly partisan?
There is a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply, and fired Babiš from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has control skills, such idle gestures are not needed.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you'd nominate for Finance Minister?
I don't even think about it, because we probably won't even be in that government, no one wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I've done that's so terrible.
So much skepticism is out of place.
The mayors have acquired a businessman, Dědek, who would like to work with you, with the People's Party perhaps winning the wing of your inclined Jiří Čunek.
I don't think so.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, and Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not oppose it, may make his way in the ODS.
I'd leave it up to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with Tomio Okamura's SPD, for example in the area of economics.
So the Okamurovs are eligible as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has a political history, he ran as a puppet of Vít Bárta for the VV, then he got money from Dawn for his company, there was some kind of coup.
He's a distinctive personality, of course.
A little brownish, of course.
If I take his agenda, he has a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, that's something to agree with.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, speaking at gallows demonstrations and wanting to leave the EU?
We are not considering working with Mr Okamura's party, I cannot imagine.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the communists' quiet support for your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It's going to be about negotiating a winner with the second in line, but God knows who's going to be the winner and who's going to be number two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the coalition government's agenda.
Let's get back to your efforts to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to abide, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go to waste, he never made a decision.
Coalition issues such as CEB and EGAP did not work.
I mean, Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
As soon as he did, CEZ took over the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister has brought a resolution written by CEZ management, which requires the Minister of Finance to vote at the general meeting of ČEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the personnel situation on the Supervisory Board and replace CEZ's top management?
Jesus Christ, if I'm going to be Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
There are rumors that CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with ČSSD for an even better one with ANO.
Well, maybe after the election, everything will go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I have no lobbyist Pokorný or Růžička, I am a separate unit and I do not deal with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you lead the government, will you seek to replace the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institution you criticize?
I would like CEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wants for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look up Mr Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in ČEZ, it never led it, it was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
CEZ is to take dukovany, value them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't have and will have no authority to fire anyone.
But to control it, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I am just saying that citizens pay around 7.2 billion a year in fees for public service radio and television, but they do not really know how these institutions run.
How do they not know?
After all, the Chamber of Deputies approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of ct and czech radio CEOs.
Look at the way the news is being discussed, the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from the investigation files and to Lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was stupid enough to be pushed by Kalousek to fire me from the government, which passed the TOP 09 percentage, but the ČSSD took them away.
They are afraid of disrupting their corrupt system, so they talk about babiš's threat to democracy.
No one's immune.
What do you think of the articles describing how the first vice-president of ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a power base by appointed his son to the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or Czech Railways?
We have a constant dispute about that.
I don't like it, and I've resonerate him a few times.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer in question works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't go that way.
As Chancellor of the Exchequer, I had no one.
Unlike the Socans, we have never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, Kratochvílová, Březina.
If there was any sign of clientelism in our country, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, no matter who it is.
