Republican Party Strategy Against Obama's Reelection
Republican leaders justified their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
But Brennan's center calls such a fraud a myth, saying that electoral fraud is less common in the US than the number of people who die after being struck by the lightning.
Indeed, Republican attorneys have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US over the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American Democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, individual states have a responsibility to organise federal elections in the US.
And in this vein, most US governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 that make it difficult for the election or to enter the electoral roll.
The phenomenon boomed after the November 2010 election, during which 675 new Republican representatives were added in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills of law restricting the right to vote in 41 states were submitted.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification card and a document of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit the periods for elections in advance, invalidate the right to be enlisted on the voting list on the day of the election, and take away the right to vote for citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no US state required the nominees to present a photo-obtelling document.
The first state to implement this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indyano Act was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to expand this advance to other states.
Over the past two years, they have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present photo ID cards.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens own, i.e. 21 million people of age to choose, no identity card with a photo issued by the government office of their state.
Furthermore, about five million new voters do not have such an identity card in 2012.
In addition, the acquisition of the required identity card often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young people, minorities and low-income earners.
25% of African-American, 15% of people with incomes under $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of the electorate aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who, as voters, are known as voters for their impending to democratic candidates, are not entitled to use their photo ID card issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote for more Republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs at the polls.
Until 2004, no state required a citizenship certificate for the elections.
The first such requirement was introduced by Arizona.
Since 2011, about a dozen states have adopted laws that provide for an obligation for voters to prove to be American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes from the Hispanic minority.
Indeed, it should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the democratic party.
In 2011, Republican Legislaturalists supported laws in eight states that abolish the electoral record on the day of the election.
In addition, they have restricted the right of people and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to sign up.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, campaigns for the registration of voters were aided by the number of people to register around 10 million.
But the measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% drop in the entry of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers then passed laws in the other five states aimed at reducing the election-winning period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans were 33% of the electorate who voted ahead of time, even though African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
For the Hispanics, it was the same.
They were just 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the passing of laws restricting the registration of voters was very strongly opposed by the democratic legislators and their supporters.
Democratic governors blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the U.S. Attorney General has even intervened.
They were partly reduced by the damage.
For example, laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card was accepted by only 16 of the 34 states.
However, the newly introduced rules will make it quite undeniably more difficult in 2012 to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics speak primarily of bias in the laws passed and see them as an apparent effort to influence the results of the 2012 election in key states.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Centre shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College required to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Revealing prostate cancer: undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test produced sometimes erroneous results that were wrongly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical procedures.
All of this increased the hesitancy of the men, who were already so reluctant to go to the examination.
To be examined or not?
We asked two experts to take the floor.
Studies conducted in the US showed a high level of contamination between the different groups tested, making it difficult to interpret these results and making valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time a European one, found a different mortality rate between the patients who underwent the examination and those who did not go to them.
This study also showed, after a 12-year gap, that those who do not go to the examination have a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
So I recommend an examination from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
The more vulnerable group are also men of African-American descent.
The key is to take the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and species that are listless.
It is therefore necessary to correctly explain to the patient the level of dangers of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and to focus more on active disease surveillance in these cases.
Today, a number of men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not being treated for leave because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not endanger their lives.
We will propose to them rather to conduct active surveillance and, in the event of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly, and with greater precision, we are setting criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not.
Nevertheless, I recommend undergoing the examination.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo the examination or not.
In cooperation with the International Urology Society, the Movember movement created a tool that allows for and against evaluation for and in connection with the PSA investigation.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous practice for cancer prevention.
Despite the advances in the research, the best means of limiting the risks of disease seems to be adopting the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthily and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be avoided.
"If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%," underlines André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian cancer research company.
By contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer causes heredity.
A percentage also remains completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer research company, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers drops.
Cigarettes are worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely bad for human health.
"There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says André Beaulieu, a spokesman.
Encouraging: 10 years after the smoker stops smoking, the risk of cancer death decreases by half.
Weight
According to SCC, bodyhood and obesity are another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout their lives," the report adds.
Niverses
The organisation also recommends that the consumption of red meat be reduced.
With too high consumption, it can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is also advisable to avoid sausages for which the same is true.
Preserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause cell damage to the body and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet drawn clear conclusions.
Studies for vitamin E are contradictory, according to SCC.
Although one of them says the risk of prostate cancer will be reduced, another study is more likely to suggest an increase in it.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unequivocally demonstrated.
Mr. Beaulieu continues to insist on how important it is to talk about his family concerns and precedents with his doctor.
"Subjecting an examination doesn't mean you'll have cancer."
Higgs boson explored
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson triggered a legitimate uproar last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the mass in the universe.
Furthermore, it is the last particle, the existence of which is predicted by the standard model - our best or "least of bad" explanations for the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
Among the physicists, however, there is not yet a 100% certainty that it is the Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have a completely new particle at our disposal, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data released this week during the big physical congress in Kyoto rather confirm it, but all the data is still missing so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, let's assume that it is the Higgs boson, as the risks of the mistake appear to be small, and look at what it is.
In this world, there is a completely indisputable law according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and don't try too hard to do so, or you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it, too: the Pauli's exclusionary principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly states" creates some of their properties.
It also divides the physicists into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermies, who obediently adhere to Pauli's principle.
And at the other end, bosons, underneath anarchists who don't appreciate anything at all - certainly not of this principle, which means they may as well be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (an utterly amazing, by the way), which is The Particle Adventure, in the laboratories of Berkeley: the mesons we leave unnoticed here, and the "force particles" through which the great forces of nature are spreading, and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow related in some way.
However, it must be said that these bosons are not as exotic animals as one might have thought.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light" which is the "carrier" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when an electric-charging particle accelerates or changes direction, it "calls" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "cancellation" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and thus one of the bosons, the "bearers of force."
More stable field
It's also with the Higgs boson, except that it takes another field to "cancel" another field, the Higgs field, to make this boson appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to its excitement, it is necessary to achieve very high energy values, like the frozen surface of the pond, which only a very large boulder is ripped up.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - the large hadron accelerator with the accommodating volumes is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop such energy.
Analogy with an electromagnetic field is again useful to us to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
With the electromagnetic field, neither all particles or all the materials react.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never be kept on its own in the fridge.
Nor, anyway, do all the particles react with the Higgs field: those that do so have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let's look at it) do not have it.
And Mrs. Novak asks, what are all these research for, what are "they'll bring us"?
From the scientific point of view, it is a confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any mismatch between the observations and predictions of the SM.
Moreover, he literally wants no physicists to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model has huge flaws so far, does not provide any clarification of gravity (the back!) or dark matter, which accounts for approximately 80% of the space mass (over-up!).
Until now, however, the CERN facility has not discovered such contradictions.
Responses
The responses of this research in the daily lives of Mr and Mrs Novák are very difficult to predict, but the mistake would be to assume that there would be none.
Behold: in the very early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in Bell's labs had no idea of the revolution their work would provoke.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing more.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who created the first permanent laser beam (the previous rays were pulse) in 1962, I already said it - the laser was initially considered such a "heap toe."
Just imagine...
And, in addition, it can result in application from any instrument that surrounds the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle did not plan to do so at first, now serves as "eyo" of all the digital cameras in the world and awarded it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it means that you really never know...
Palliative care - The best way to leave your life... | | Le Devoir
Through his Commissioner for Disease, Quebec recently engaged in a delicate question about the end of life.
The debate should continue shortly and, at the same time, a bill is being drafted.
There is still a lot of work to do in this crucial area.
Le Devoir magazine attempted to take a closer look at the issue.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, which consumed it, gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years of my life and it's already seven," he says, emotionally in his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had come the previous day.
"It's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its work: immense weakness prevents him from going to the restroom alone or just to eat himself.
He looks resignedly at the tasty-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talks to the unknowns who stop by his place, bring him medicine, offer him a bath.
Courage to die.
"My greatest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, it humbles me," he confides.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
"In the whole life, you learn to urinate men standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the child's stage is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of the man to accept that person, the psychologist says.
In the view of a number of people dealing with palliative care, crucial moments take place at the very heart of such a return.
Patients who enter a Victor-Gadbois's home with a pumping-and-tale care are all suffering from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "therapeutic" care.
In the case of Mrs.A., 89, the worst fear is to die "for asteeth in full consciousness."
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I've never had any wishes in my life," he says, and then he agrees to put her on a breathing apparatus.
Nevertheless, he is still looking forward to his son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, in collaboration with a group of volunteers, it provides body care with the help of nutrition.
This is the Palliative Care, which is coming in, if nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, one bed of Palliative Care is per 1,700 population.
That's very little if we realize we're all going to die someday.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Whether it's the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, you can provide, for example, a sip of brandy or pepsi, to the taste.
Diabetics no longer need to watch their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life here.
Last night, they were carrying the beer to Mr. X., who died later that night.
This morning, his son will finish his beer in honor of the late father.
"We help patients as well as our loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, the director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, the days after another go, but they don't look like each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who rejoices in his last encounter with his family thoroughly padded on cushions while toasting him in his honor, a tragically 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, a woman and two young children, dies tragically after trying out all the possibilities to survive.
"For half a year, there are always three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel tells us with concern.
53% of patients who come to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to Palliative Care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to the lalirative care, i.e. the care that is intended to alleviate the suffering as soon as the sufferer reaches the final stage of his life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Grand Montréal Pivative Predictation Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental inaccuracy inaccessibility of health care in Quebec that leads to a number of doctors specializing in paviative care fearing the adoption of the euthanasia and assisted suicide law.
Since October, the manifesto has been circulating, signed by the leaders of palliative treatment, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure all people's access to high-quality palliative care before it is possible to agree to perform euthanasia.
As she says, she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He is concerned that patients should not apply for death on the grounds that they are not receiving appropriate care.
At the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of their unfavourable prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she left the demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting his treatment, she said she regretted that I was quitting, she was telling us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of the sick who wish to die thank their treating doctors for not fulfilling their wishes when a team of palliative cuddles eased their pain.
But it has to be said that Palliative care is definitely not all-powerful in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients resist treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives to hijack the patient until the moment of the demise, either on impact or whether the sedative is permanently administered to him.
It is impossible to pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
A patient we will not relieve of pain will have an increasing opportunity to access palliative sedatives.
The sick who are not provided with a sedative always say the same thing: 'I want to die'.
But this does not necessarily necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," it means "I rather want you to relieve me of the pain."
The implementation of this report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Road administration officials, construction and public-sector entrepreneurs, lobbyists from political parties and Italian mafia experts still tell us what they know about the amazing "system" that blends construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
This "field" cost the Quebec taxpayer very dearly, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system has been crumpled up since we took major measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former head of police in Montreal, ironically.
Thanks to him, a scandal erupted in 2011 on the basis of a rigorous inquiry into the misappropriation of funds in connection with the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which was approved by the then Liberal Quebec Prime Minister Jean Charest only after lengthy deferrals.
The "Duchesneau report" confirmed a direct link between the industry, opaque party funding and the corruption of civil servants.
"Ever since the investigation began in 2010," he says, "the Department of Transportation has only saved $1 billion in contracts," with some people keeping their instincts to gain a share of them!
The Charbonneau Commission "has brought two mayors to resign," he adds, hoping to "create the cunning of some people."
Permanent Corruption Unit established in 2011
A permanent corrupt force, founded in 2011, is also involved in the fight with its military of government controllers, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau's company" who have ensured since 2009 that the Montreal "poney barge" would significantly soften the inflating of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have conducted a number of searches and indicted for fraud and corruption, a number of municipal representatives, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban municipality.
Another on the list is to be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest Quebec city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The formal allegations have already been received by transport engineers from Montreal and Italian-born entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Lino Zambito drew a sensation by explaining to the commission the "system" mechanism for obtaining public procurement.
He himself dedicated the 3% of the value of the commissions he won in Montreal to a mafia-related midfielder, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which the mayor of Gérald Tremblay ran.
Zambito was generous in all sides after 2000, and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately €68,000) to provincial parties, but especially to the Liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts of money-making whose prices he exaggerated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked very keenly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in great detail to the commission: over the course of ten years, he received gifts from the construction companies, the invitation to the trip, the golf tournaments, the restaurants, the hockey games, and the pocket money, worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with the money he overstated the price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted to having paid their bonuses for upgrading invoices by 30% to 40% through false extras.
The mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, then accused Tremblay of turning a blind eye without embarrassment to the simultaneous budget that fed dirty money into his coffers.
On the basis of these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montreal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies in the east of the island, it has been advocating since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million promoters right in the middle of a flourishing real estate deal.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be launched, says that he is "turning on strings in an attempt to understand the functioning of the milk-watered system to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
The process, she said, was "painful but positive."
We are in the wound cleaning phase, but it is necessary to establish our own investigative unit in Montreal and ensure supervision so that these dubious practices cannot be reversed.
Like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that "the public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly worried about the role of "mates informed about this ruse" if they did not mingle with these shenanigans!
He estimates that 70% of the funding for election campaigns in Quebec comes from dirty money, adding with irony: "I have heard that this is just a weak brew of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to the parties to $100, but according to him this will not resolve the situation: "Until the electoral spending is strictly limited, dirty money from politics will not go away."
It proposes comprehensive scrutiny of the public procurement and party funding system: "We cannot fall back to the burden; if we boldly focus on the substance of affairs, we can rebuild on more solid foundations and with greater scrutiny and compliance with the law."
If this story has blacked out the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends everyone who mocks it to see their own backyard...
"PSG is not a FC Barcelona!"
This season, you and PSG have set an entirely new pace.
How do you explain these developments?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other, or the absolutely new dimension of PSG.
The big players came to us.
Every day I come along next to them.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these realities allow me to raise the level of the game.
And it's easier in the games.
In football, things go really fast.
I'm not losing my head.
Ever since my beginnings in the INF Clairefontaine prep school to the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I've always moved up by the stages.
So you are using the competitive environment introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The boosts from this summer are accustomed to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give the maximum performance.
Plus, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of credit for my status.
He has assistants to hand like Claude Makelelele, who used to play in the same post as me.
And does Ancelotti have the final say at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technicians.
He is no equal in League One today and is among the best European coaches.
He has vast experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
I had a reassuring conversation with him in January.
I've had a number of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first part of the PSG season?
In League One, Lyon took away our top position.
But we remain in tow.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it to the last eight very easily.
What is your club's goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group first before Porto so we can play in the rematch of the last eight at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget's got it...
To become a major European club, Paris must win the titles and make history.
It is not yet like this today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to implement this intention.
And would it be a big failure not to win in League One like last season?
Of course, that would be very disappointing.
We really want to win the league title this year.
We missed a lot last season.
We were disappointed in May because we had the money to win.
We had a great season.
We've racked up 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you're a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even more apt season.
I think it will be done this year.
Even if the title is sought by the big teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have the weapons at our disposal to beat them.
Do you think the media expects PSG too much?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us given what has been invested here and what players we have.
We totally accept that.
It's a fact that if we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and there's still something they blame us for in the paper, that's not very pleasant.
One asks what more people want from you.
You can't win 4-0 every weekend, of course.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a playing style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we proved we can play.
Take a look at Manchester City, who have not made it to the last eight for the second season, and they have also invested big sums!
Given the amounts invested, you'd expect to be 15 points ahead of the others!
This offends the other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which did not do well in last year's season, moved up to the next stage with the new PSG.
That shows how awesome the League One is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have managed to win.
It seems as if PSG are relying on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic in everything.
It is good that they say there is a "addiction to Zlatan."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves to be the star of the league.
Everywhere he went through, he proved to be a big player, a world star.
In our team we respect both man and the players.
He, too, respects the people he has around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This has also led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows the others to grow alongside each other.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn't play the way I'd have imagined.
But I've been through it, and I've come out of it stronger.
Today I am also doing well in the national team to play good matches.
And that's what I've been hoping for since I joined the national team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we owe it to ourselves to make our demeanour exemplary.
How do you feel about Didier Deschamps' first months at the top of the national team?
There are results for him.
We are in a good place in qualifying for the World Championships.
The coach selects sternly, is close to the players and can get excited about the victory.
That was Laurent Blanc.
I don't want to compare them.
Blanc has achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euros.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take our team to Brazil.
There is a draw (1:1) from 16. October in Spain with a solid starting match?
This match gave us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I have not experienced such a match in my career.
Bitcoin lets you pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true within these technologies, there is an obvious political outlook: the belief that the existing financial system built on banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonymous), represents both virtual money (transferable to dollars, euros...), and a secure transfer protocol similar to the BitTorrent, which allows the file exchange between the partners' pairs.
Thanks to the 15,000 computers involved in the network, around 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoin as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first reached a maximum of $30 ($23) in June 2011, dropping to $2 five months later, hovering at about $10 today (the odds summary is shown on bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the world's exchange for real money or financial products, this is not impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
He calls bitcoin "the most successful virtual money," "the competing dollar and the euro" and "the day of ordinary money."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is like the "credits" used to advance in the video game, which one gets through the game or that one can buy (and sometimes replace it again).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But every month, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes of the network are the depositaries of the current accounts book, the controllers, the issuers of the money and the buyers as well as the sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two electronic addresses by e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, making them anonymous.
The information file related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double-wrench encryption system.
The network can thus verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
The content of the file furthermore makes it possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in a public book of current accounts that are distributed throughout the network.
The key phase is to write this new transaction in this book.
It takes place by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, whose investigator, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is a stage of dismantling the set; i.e. the transformation of the huge set into a shorter and unique digital imprint.
Computers "take over" this new transaction and add a number to it before "sat the whole."
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its accuracy.
The transaction is then indestructibly displayed to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would change the fingerprint.
If a user would like to pay the same money for fraud very quickly (within ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other one will be abandoned because each of them has a different imprint.
The computer that solves the challenge will win 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this remuneration is shared regularly by two, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited by 21 million, but can be divided into as much as a hundred millionth, so the margin space is there...
The difficulty of the task specified is also increased with the increasing level of calculation.
The net has seen its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the stolen bitcoins has been stolen.
"The used loophole is not about the protocol itself," assures Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-frewn-based payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also controls the money laundering options thanks to this anonymous service.
But the problem also applies to cash.
Significant players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, as a WordPress blog platform, receive them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of current accounts and demonstrated that nearly 80% of bitcoin are not being circulated.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
"Firty $1,000 was exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul in the transformation of bitcoin into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a teaching book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is an equivalent credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payments, but uses a Bitcoin system to verify transactions that make it cheaper.
In addition, the wearer manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up for merchants, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just give the address that can be "photographed and disclosed" by phone, clarifying Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems and a transition to more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while before Bitcoin succeeds, but 2013 could be decisive," he predicts.
In addition, in its report, the ECB envisages a rethink of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The biggest harm was suffered by the people in the Afghan countryside, who we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so do we, we've lost 88 soldiers killed, and all the wounded and the maim.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they were joined by the jihadists, Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbeks, the Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local rebels, but if the Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French units from the foundation of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains encased with almond trees thanks to French loans, took place in an orderly fashion.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without attacking with the aerial accompaniment of a helicopter.
As of the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be so active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable progression between 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed considerably.
Kabul was empty then, and the earth was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various resistance groups.
Their takeover of the ground was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscene of these peasants, which were completely dominated by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved until our time.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an attempt to preserve women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became traffickers, seized the state-owned land they sold as a building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge U.S. contracts for subcontractors.
They were discredited; most of them had never even been in combat.
From what I've heard in the campaigns, people are craving a government that will not be made up of thieves.
Many of the youngsters want to leave as those who have managed to take advantage of American generosity will leave: the capital flight is considerable.
The young are tired of the war and its associated ideology.
During exile in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and their advantages took hold.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; there are currently 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full, with girls and boys.
These young people will need to be given jobs, they no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, likes mobile phones; they watch TV and Turkish shows the modern world everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that take over as its foreseeable role be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army are already being rebuilt by provincial militias beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralization along the lines of Western nations, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so that the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been restored, no dam is operating, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
Rumors have been booed that Afghanistan has a huge mineral wealth.
And this only fueled the feeling that the Western states were only there to seize it.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without the means to transport raw materials through the mountains, however, there can be no mining of minerals.
The Chinese had almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving the international archaeological teams (at the support of the World Bank) to explore the sprawling Buddhist area to retain the role of the most important employer in the province.
One day, Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of both imports and exports depend, will also need to resume normal relations.
The departure of the French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement foresees the continuation of the common types of assistance: girls' and boys' lyceums, the Department of French at the universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the "getting heart and soul" initiative has worked, attempting to reconcile aid and military action, in which the Ministry of Defence's "Civic-Armenacea Steps" service, which was abolished in 2012, but achieved a number of successes in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural renewal in dozens of mountain villages, thanks to a small French NGO.
These works, involving a multitude of local workers, helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of the cultivable area.
What memory will we leave behind after two billion euros of army spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often at an altitude above 2 000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written applications for small-scale agricultural assistance from the local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, these farmers wish, they say, to achieve a slight civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly affected.
Ddlist work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohamed Morsi embarked on another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants unlimited powers, it has decided to play the ball.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of everyone else's opinion, that the Constituent Assembly would approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the head of state awarded this rally another two months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years, Egypt has been using a makeshift text that has been supplemented many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal conjecture.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country's ambivalence.
From the opposition's point of view, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "violate his word" and "hitching the law."
But his supporters assure that this is a means of tackling the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should take place in two weeks' time.
This is a very short period of time that will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify the text with the article after the article.
For the president, it is also a way of re-acquiring national and democratic legitimacy, while the country is roiled by protests.
As he confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the Egyptian people before the ultimatum: 'Either you approve my text or I will have unlimited powers' left to myself', which should otherwise end after the new constitution is approved.
And in this particular climate, yesterday, 85 deputies of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
Most of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the Constitution was announced, they slammed through the door, saying they did not have the opportunity to assert their views.
Defenders of human rights, civil society or members of religious minorities have imitated their move.
In order to achieve a quorum, 11 alternate replacements were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising then that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators went on to pause to say that one of the few disputes revolved around . . . a prayer class that day, when some committee members took the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly adjusted.
The text, which was still voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of general attention, Article 2, remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution, and states that "sharia law principles are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules," which would allow for a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected represents a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
"Hyrability," the liberals, who see only a rhetorical problem, object.
In their view, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which entrusts the University of al-Azhar with an advisory role, in particular to the issues of the monitoring of the conformity of Sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert, Sophie Pommier, this is unsettling because "persons called for comment are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This can be seen as the beginnings of the theocracy."
The liberals' fears are further fueled by the fact that the next university rector should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a framework civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamas, but university staff, many of whom have graduated from French schools," says Alexis Blouet, who is preparing work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
However, he agrees that "there may be contradictions about the interpretation of Article 220, because the terms used in it belong to the religious vocabulary.
There is a reference in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic Legal Science].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to comment on it."
The text approved yesterday is highly criticised in addition to the religious sites because of the expanded powers that it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction in them compared to the former regime.
Another contentious place: powers conferred on the military.
In accordance with the wishes of the military's representatives, the defence budget will not be carried out by parliament, but by the National Defence Council.
Furthermore, the civil proceedings against civilians will not be prohibited in the military courts, as requested by the human rights association.
These associations speak of their doubts in the context of the text, which they claim are directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point is the prohibition of torture laid down in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to address in a televised address last night, rallies are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will then rally on Saturday.
In Israel, the holy places, the world's navel and the sea are waiting for Ukrainian tourists from a saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the magnitude of biblical truths, modern comfort, and the touching nature of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Complime with the holy sites
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who enter this "pee" will descend on God's mercy.
And Galilee - instead of Jesus' miracles: the transformation of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, the soothing of the storm and the filling of the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples and after the resurrection.
But most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers will pass the Path of Path, or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Laten: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonio - Pretoria - where the court was held, walks through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of the Holy Grave on Mount Golgotha - to the point of crucifixion, to the stone of the anointing and the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is a symbolic Christian navel of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the site where, according to the Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made to Jesus' crucifixion.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the rest of the temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave the writings with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a Vertical Road
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained from a secret hiding place from the enemy that Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on the cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
It can be reached by its own forces only by those involved in climbing.
Others will be taken to this historic mountain by a cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1,600-2040 m, there is the well-known Hermon ski resort, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
To this ski paradise, a shuttle bus takes tourists from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to the ancient legend, the pagan gods supposedly lived on top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are around 300 museums in this country.
In one trip, you can't visit all of them.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses ancient Kumrán manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, which were found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel-Aviv is also worth a visit.
His exhibition is widely represented by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézann, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon you can visit the Al Basha-clouzně museum, which for visitors are represented by several rooms of the ancient Turkish spa with mannequins of spa users and spa keepers from that time.
In Caesarei, the unique private Ralli Museum is worth a visit, where you can admire the statues of Dalí and Roden.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum - the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem, in Tel Aviv - tells of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter in - and find yourself in total darkness.
The stars glitter.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished are heard.
Also listed is Ukraine.
Improve your health
Israel's three main spa resorts are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead coasts.
Each offers swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinarium and oceanarium.
Interestingly, you can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, as the water temperature in it does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and in it people bathe all year round.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest landmark of the planet - at 417 m below sea level.
The water in it is saturated with a saturated saline solution that is easy to keep even people who can't swim.
The surrounding countryside is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salty water - brine, and a healing mud that can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, ecstasy, arthritis, bronchitis, bronchitis, diabetes, to heal your ruffled nerves.
Touch the mysterious ancient past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Across them was a famous naval route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which they then shared a long and happy life.
Tourists truly love wanderers through the narrow streets, named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you press your hands on the walls in the alley of "his" sign, your luck will be favorably favored.
In Jaffa, you may meet the newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to get their picture taken.
And in Caesarei - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theatre and "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of the Roman Prosecutors, including Pontski's Pilate.
The carefully renovated theatre is used today for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, a word for a word
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country, about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
It is better to take money with you in euros for the journey, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (nowing 1 is approximately 3.8 shekels).
The city's transport is mainly buses, but there is a speed tram in Jerusalem, and in the city of Haifa, there is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connect the lower city to the upper town.
It's basically an underground cableway.
Travelling by all urban public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel with 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Sept.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, work stops in marketplaces, shops and public transport.
And the working week starts on Sunday morning.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, you will only get kosher meals: with the exception of pork, seafood, no-big-less fish and food that feature a combination of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, made from coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus porridge, various sauces, mute pooches - falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are very many fattened cats who are graciously "twolen to their taste."
In the evening, you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The overcoming cats love the crowded places and embrace the likes of embracing every goodwill.
Renting a car, according to the car's brand, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 a day.
And to borrow a bike will cost around 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for the museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by the numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
To get to know the country and to rest most of the citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came.
The promised land was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, up 51% from the same period in 2010, before the visa waiver 9. February 2011.
"Big and Powerful" to Moscow announces: emigrants save their language money
While MPs and human rights defenders are still debating the law on compulsory language examinations, fraudsters have already appeared in the country selling 'fair' certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities, 13 million foreign workers come to attend each year.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmen.
Their only goal is to make enough money to support the families at home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force, according to which every working migrant will be required to pass a test of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing and municipal sectors, lifestyle and retail sales.
However, the FMS promises that over time the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
The knowledge of the language will also have to be confirmed in order to obtain and extend the work permit.
The exemption applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
This law is not subject to people who have successfully obtained an attestation and obtain an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, convictions and rights protection
The network of exam sites will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship's Friendship Between Nations, Moscow State University, State University of St. St.P.G. and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; already in Russia, more than 160 such centres are open.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by the members of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: what would it really bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
For starters - responding to the migration service - this will make it possible to reduce the number of people suffering as a result of 'Stroro's work'.
Many people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains FMS Russian Chairman of the Board of Directors in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated before they leave.
Only the system of organised recruitment will make it possible to solve the problems of foreign workers by 90% of the problems.
Problems arise for emigrants without professions, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language - he says with the conviction of Sebelev - the future migrant is doomed to clashes with dishonest people who, on the pretext of aid, will provide him with a "pretty utility" in the form of a landslide, tight-knits in which he and dozens of others, such as himself, will languish for months without food and documents and toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
"They promise them one thing in their homeland, but they will be cheated on arrival, confiscate their passports, they do not pay their promised wages," confirms the head of the Main Tajik Management of the MS's labour migration to Tajžice migration of MS Tob.
Don't swear!
All less so because many of the Central Asian Republic's citizens who intend to go to work in Russia acknowledge that they are not only ignorant of the language of the country they want to get into, but they do not even have the experience of the work.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as it is unhappiness: only very few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families also need to feed their children with something, not to mention the fact that they need to be dressed, put on, and fitted to school.
As children reach their working age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it's hard - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the Language Tests Act, the human rights defenders point to one important thing.
Testing will only be carried out for those migrants who are legally in a legal position.
If they don't have it, they won't take the exams or get any more official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers live illegally as they used to in Russia.
"Welcome to the Invicious Entry
Many of the incoming workers say that getting official status in our country is not easy.
Reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all the linguistic difficulties.
Legalization also costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Russian police staff know that we have basically fake documents, without registration, and the resulting blackmail cases.
"They require a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," - he shared with the press about his experience of Tajikistan's Umed Kushkhaladamov.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that the fake ones were not only the migrant's registration documents.
FMS staff have already confiscated several fake language examal certificates.
Counterfeit documents are printed on a plain colour printer.
Of course, they did not reach the new owners for free: each of the migrants, in the hope of making the problem of undergoing the tests, so much as they would pay 7,000 rubles for the document.
That's two and a half times the amount more than passing the official test: it's going to cost the migrant workers three thousand roubles.
The main task of the immediate future is thus to secure the system from corruption so that workers cannot simply buy the documents, in which government officials and human rights defenders agree.
Meanwhile, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the tests the first time the time they needed to take a course in the foundations of the Russian language.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active negotiations with people are not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not circulate the illegal market for weapons
The proportion of offences using legally held weapons is very low
Russia's MVD is tabling a proposal to tighten the law in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
It is a response from government authorities to recent events: the impetus was the instigations of the shooting at weddings that passed without casualties, and the massacre prepared by Moscow attorney Dimitrio Vinogradov, which killed seven people as a result.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which to obtain a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21.
This idea is supported by the head of the House of Security and the Fight against Corruption, Irin Jarovaj, who has promised to be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem of the "crocking of the screws" path.
An open letter has appeared in the network, with the authors - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demanding a rejection of the "senseless tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminologist in an interview with the BBC's Russian newsroom.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed in the six months of 2012 using firearms registered by the authorities of the Interior Ministry, while a total of 1168,000 crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced, the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not prompt the perpetrators to switch to the "black" market.
In their words, any weapon can currently be found in Moscow at a low cost.
At present, the Ministry of the Interior claims that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied with several channels.
There are five main channels, says retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who has worked for ten years in the departments of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages that take weapons orders
The first - "army or military journey," that is, the weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The soldiers were also stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baraněc says.
Another type of "black weapons" are guns stolen from security forces officials.
Baranec explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses as well as guns stolen directly from the employees of the law enforcement authorities.
Illegal "mainly" is on sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, there are often explosions.
"It is proven that some of the fires were started intentionally - to cover the shortfall," says the former soldier.
In the words of Barance, the contribution is also provided by the arms manufacturers.
"At present, private arms companies are being created that are not competitive on the international market and are decommissioning the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the "black" market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and vending machines come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes the weapons are made in small-scale production, and a mafia was created to organize their fluid production," explains the former soldier.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have added up the approximate share of individual sources of shipments of illegal weapons to the "black" market.
The report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and the Design of Public Administration.
Specialists have dismantled the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, the criminology literature and the data of public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers report, come from the military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons have been found on the black market "the fault of the official officials whose work is linked to the weapons," the report says.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases theft of weapons in their production took place, 5% is "black archaeology."
The dealer-consultant at one of the gun shops who asked us not to give his name is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by the black "archelogists" are no longer being bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, he says, vendors go to military warehouses for new shipments for new shipments.
Through the ensign, the bidder buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
You order the gun at his place and he sells it to you over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," he tells me.
"The truth is that the police are well in the loop, and therefore whenever a plan burns to them to clarify the offences, they will carry out a control purchase from the illegally-armed merchants," the consultant adds.
"Like a luxury store"
The sellers most often find each other through their acquaintances.
I visited the website and blogs until a fellow came along who offered me the chance to switch to the "Tattering" platform, where there would be a man to lead me to the "out of out" where we would negotiate.
The award was mainly known to me there
Military correspondent Viktor Baraněc
If I want to get a gun, I need an acquaintance who knows the way out, the salesman tells us - a consultant. - I have such an acquaintance, but I do not fully trust him.
There are sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovic, who asked me to tell me that my daughter's tooth had fallen out."
And now I'm going to get there through the person I'm sure of.
He'll only deliver them to me, too, because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was processing a paper for a publication on the subject.
The schematics, he said, had not changed.
They gave him an album with photographs where it was "everything you thought about."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, in the words of Baraněce, is not offered a hauci in a bag - you can try everything out.
I, the potential client, just don't buy - we go with the seller to the woods and build a target for it.
"They give me the chance to shoot, and when I see that the weapon is shooting well, we are starting to act," the expert describes the procedure.
The reservoir on the sofa
Search engines will bring you online to both the website and groups of the "Compass," where you can buy a weapon "for different purposes."
This requires no documents or face-to-face meetings.
"You only have to have a set amount of money," the website says, "Buy a fighting pistol or an automatic."
On this site, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And the sale to the minors?
"Of course no license," the user asks "Ivan" (the copy is preserved).
"I'll buy TT.Moscow" - he briefly formulates the "Fedorenkov" request.
Federal security services recently threw off a vast network of dummy websites, and people wishing to buy a military weapon can be shovelled.
People flock like hungry fish for bait and then conquer coal in Siberia.
Military Rapporteur and Mining Movie Commander Viktor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes:web pages are usually registered beyond the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment via the ATM.
"In response, the seller sends him a photograph and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," says the press spokesperson for the NGO "Law on the Gun" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baraněc confirms that after the order on the website is placed, you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.
Federal security services recently threw off a vast network of dummy websites, and people wishing to buy a military weapon can be shovelled.
"People flock like hungry fish for bait and then conquer coal in Siberia," he confirms.
Makarov for $100
When buying an illegal firearm, you will usually pay the sum of between $100 and $900.
In the words of Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Blag to the Gun," you will acquire the Makarov pistol for between $100 and $300.
You have to wait a month to a month and a half months.
The weapon is dispatched from warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of a medium article.
According to the official statistics office, the number of these crimes in Russia fell by a total of 7%, compared to the January-October 2011 period, and was 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cleared cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
The work at the box office of "McDonald" will be passed by up to a quarter of all US teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low wages in Walmart's hypermarkets and the restaurants of popular fast-food chains, such as "McDonald," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will be transformed into a wave of the ninth, or whether it is destined to be extinguished soon.
This share is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in the humble salaries received by the regular staff at Walmart and the fast-food systems, the protest organizers' goal is to create them in their trade unions.
At present, the economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called "black Friday," when an orgy of cheap sales struck America, engulfed millions of residents and, in some cases, accompanied by fights.
On this day, some Walmart workers, in which there are 2.2 million people working worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with unions and left-wing activists of multinational retail chain companies whose goods are for the people of the lower and middle class.
Walmart sells everything around the world, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
That's why many low-wage employees at Walmart stores only buy at work.
The availability and range of goods made the Walmart chain one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods so cheaply because they pay little of their employees.
They also complain of poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic carts or hand-source scanners.
Demonstrators on "Black Friday" demanded a pay rise and complained that the cost of the health insurance costs provided by the company rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart worker receives $9.5 per hour, but that does not match the cost altitude, say the staff.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
It is on average 1.1% more than this company is spending on salaries now.
If Walmart moves the wage hike fully to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will only cost 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart's attorneys point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should cause virtually no damage to the company.
"Black Friday" at the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart was selling about 5,000 items of merchandise per second.
Overall, its coffers made nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday."
In an interview with the Huffington Post's left-tier website, a representative, Dan Fogelman said the jobs had been abandoned by a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was all but the "next media sensation" orchestrated by the unions.
"An unencumbered cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their destination was not Walmart department stores (those in that progressive city are not very popular, and therefore there are hardly any of them), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick leave and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal and New York State regulations is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are gradually increasing this wage, but only moderately, and on average, their regular staff in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower wage.
I don't quite understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the desk after school and live with their parents and live with their parents go through the "McDonald" office.
Few people see it as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At the moment, I am constantly meeting with the "McDonald" staff in an interview who complain that they have to live off this money and sometimes even feed my children from it.
On the other hand, a commentary hangs on the Wall Street Journal Forum, the author's note that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "Mconaldo" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks at fast-food outlets start receiving at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also requested that trade unions be established in the fast food sector.
US law prohibits the administration from hindering the establishment of trade unions and punish activists with bullying and dismissal the trade union movement.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes their lives easier.
However, launching a fast food outlet for a trade union is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the unusually high turnover of staff.
Disagree
There were noisy protests on this day in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the event was a rally at "McDonald" near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians, notably city council member Jumaane Williams, spoke, who said: "McDonald" says he sells billions of portions, and then he doesn't even pay you sick pay for your honest work and doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!"
The demonstrators also received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as the city's mayor's candidate, Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must speak out together to support fast-food workers to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast-food spheres.
But only a few hundred people attended, though by far not all of them were fast-food staff, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark to ignite the flame of the mass movement is as yet unclear.
"So far, the brain is deceiving average"
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology, the augmented reality is a popular theme; more recently, this means seeing the world especially through the prisms of special glasses.
At its annual conference, Google presented a working model for the news at its annual conference, and it was announced in November that Microsoft had also filed a request for the relevant patent.
An interview with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft Sharam Izadim's Cambridge laboratory shows that the glasses are a thing of the past for the company's scientists.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, the creation of virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us, in a general way, what is your research group doing?
- We are looking at human-machine interactions, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity, meanwhile, is stuck in the stage of working with the pixels on the flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with its finger.
We want to look for 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox is now for sale without Kinect sensors, as it is very interesting for everyone to manage with gestures.
- What else is ahead of us in the future?
- Regardless, the Kinect system has transferred the interaction to the physical level, very many interactions are still taking place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives a larger amount of data), but the output flow is not particularly available yet.
We are trying to change this, we are working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
You need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to get to know not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
That's a popular thing, but isn't it overestimated?
- Surely it cannot be considered a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our surroundings of our activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, to control equipment in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about sweeping, just such sketchy, short.
The gestures would not be scanned with a camera device, but with a bracelet that would track the movements of the bones and muscles.
It's large so far, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.
How's that?
- How, for example, do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade?
You tell and show it at the same time.
-I usually just just talk.
- Oh, it's going to be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get the users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at any given moment?
- That's not necessary at all, but it's a mutual bonding.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a relatively good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you are to talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or something else today?
- Basically the current generation - that's what we can bounce back from in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be a good idea to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it's not just the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
At the current point of view, all the current technologies are insufficient for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So it's also very important to speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current data flows of 30 frames per second are frankly a little small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our laboratory in Redmond made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delays of 1 to 100 ms, with the current, mass-produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent of this affects a person's interaction with a machine.
For me at work it would be a very useful equivalent of such a device, I just don't need so much touch, but I need some extra per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- Three "cameras" are now being used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a deflected signal receiver.
And the third camera already - this is actually a common visible band sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras could potentially solve the problem ...
Or make it worse because it would increase the necessary volume of calculations made.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analogue system, play with the curvature of the camera location and see how it helps in determining the three-dimensional position.
- As I recall correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not present its glasses publicly.
Don't you think that when it comes to the daily use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, it is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking while constantly holding the smatphone in the raised hands isn't very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be the "portable" form of the expansion of reality, when it would be possible to switch from glasses to smartphone, projection display at any time based on the cloud platform.
The glasses - this is a very personal device, that's their strength (only you see the private stuff), and at the same time also the weakness - augmented reality based on the glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time as other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man" but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out:there is no touch response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers are your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile perceptions could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the other hand as a certain kind of background for imaging.
He's making an excellent record of the compression!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tangibility to these "files in the air" - for example, the interference of a few directional ultrasonic rays at the defined point where the finger is located, evokes a tactile sensation, but it is still very faint - as if you blow on the bellows of your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Have you tried to deceive the brain yet?
To think he could feel what he seemed to feel when he was seeing something at the moment?
-That's a good idea, we haven't tried that yet.
Here is yet another challenge that will be fought for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking through an open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of running tracks (not at all like in the clubs), the moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a target, then work is for many years to come.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so appealing to researchers - many things are in the very beginning.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the "St Petersburg avant-garde" project, dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and the arts.
At the top of the list were already the eminent figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe without achieving a lecker's fame.
The new hero of "Rosbaltu" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, who you meet here at the Russian Museum, the one at the Summer Garden, the one in the fashion pubs and the openers.
The paintings of Cyril Miller, wherever they are displayed, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is the striking man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 1990s.
In addition to being a city man, his appearance on the streets is a smile on the face of citizens, he increases everyone's mood.
He recently picked up a flask and became a St. Petersburg organ grinder because he matured into this complex role with his whole bohemian life, philosophies and image.
- Cyril, why do you walk around the city all over in red and not in yellow or, for example, turquoise?
- I chose the red color as a designer dealing with the look and image.
In this world, the red colour represents a compromise between the artist, the imagemaker and the public.
While, in general, everything that is only a little different from gray is an aggressive and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at making an interview.
The whole history of my provocative acts is primarily an invitation to discuss.
-When did you understand that you must be an artist?
- At the exhibition at the House of Culture in Nevvsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understood what my journey was.
That's when the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I couldn't understand the new, free types of artists.
I befriended the new-wave artists, the post-gazonvic, who brought us to "Pushkin 10," and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to the theatre, to dress, to the music, to all genres except the word.
- And all of this merged into your art-clinic ...- It was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of Peterburk, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995 I took a place on Pushkinská 10, and there before the reconstruction there was a music-art club, a bohemian club, home to the Petrovburg bohemian bohemian.
There, much was born:NOM, Tequila Jazz, remember how they brought Shur in with the "Ucho Van Gogh" project.
Šnur and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, dressed in fitting leotards, in the middle between them by the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in vogue.
When the band started playing live, they became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg led many programs of the Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtěnberg, thus starting his great career, basic education and training he got from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - this is the reverberation of Art Clinic.
This is where our working and regular guests left.
I am the hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000 a survey was held in the press, the special award being "People in Our City."
In the nomination of "Artist of the Year" I was named, which ended my peak.
In new times according to the old rules, the work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the current years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are characterised in a recognisable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are the hits in which the topicality and penetration are vividly captured.
I'll have a programmine exhibition called "Russian Museum in the Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now being so is painful and terrible.
But in the clowns, everything is wiped out, the tragic is taken.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, save the world through a totalitarian disguise in the order of the adjustment.
Today, people meet by their clothes, orientate themselves to external mechanics, not to the inner human.
Or maybe you can't shake his hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing.
- We saw you the other day as the city's organ grind. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should be that if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, utility art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
There is a breakdown of cultures.
Previously, people would gather in clusters, to love the bohemian one, the simple other.
Today everything broke up on the micro-companies, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everyone.
You need to think today who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has his 100 fans.
- And there will be several thousand spectators to Stas Mikhailov!
- Fans will come to him, where the sexually social sphere is involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural attic, and 10,000 don't come, and the result is less management, money, everything withers.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one will fool them and break what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures that hung on the wall at a collector with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings that people usually end up with.
Today, people often confuse concepts.
They say:Culture of the clergy, the consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that is from elsewhere.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday's day, I grew up on the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refusing money to draw pictures.
And I'm for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is scarce in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an official through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper czars, it wasn't in everything, the Tsars might not have understood much of the culture, but they understood the need to support the real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
Back home in St. Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they are tucked away in a corner somewhere, because there is a need for great experts who will correctly appreciate these experts and put them on the right path.
Today, taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but it differs in that they sincerely say that we accept not all modern art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think Peterburk is?
- Petersburg - this is not the capital of culture, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is the right soil.
And on our angle, the arts are fading miserably.
We need cultural ground, but with us there are more writers today than readers, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are inquisitive, who like to go to shows, concerts.
With us, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashionable affair, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is being implemented for the St. Petěrburk grant
Grading in Space
The country is in danger.
Global warming or collisions with a killer asteroid.
The caravans of the spacecraft with the Earthlings on board are on their way, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep their gender in wease weightless conditions or on a given replacement planet?
I don't think the selection is very big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be mastered, if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," says a senior senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, P. K. Šternberg (SAIŠ) Vladimir Surdin.
But while conditions for life are better on Mars, temperatures reach 500 degrees Celsius on the surface of Venus.
It's only possible to live there at a great height or in the Renaissance orbit... in space.
The questions of reproduction in the universe were started by fauna scientists.
Already half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their Earth's relatives.
It was then carried out by insects to orbit - the very small fruit flies of Drosophil.
In 1979, quail's eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops in weightlessness.
We get an absolutely normal bird on the climb.
But then the problems begin.
"There is a problem with this bird having to find support, it has to stand on its own two feet and start moving," says RAN's head of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP) laboratory.
If they don't find support, the birds fall erratically and do somersaults.
After 10 hours, the newly-willied birds had a complete demise of instinct.
The birds did not respond to the light or the sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
"We let the birds hatch twice, but then we refused because it's just impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev comments on the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last "miniarch" with the animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
But in the bio-satellitus "Bion" there will only be beings of one sex.
There was an experiment with rats who were already gravoid-streamed.
They basically didn't find anything supernatural.
"It was only on the biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, the space rats had their offspring.
However, it has not yet been approached to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe.
It's a tough task.
In the process of losing the usual environment, the animals simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens reigns with abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger was Tereshkova.
The most expensive thing that mankind has is the female body.
Our Chaika flew out, and no one on Earth could tell if he would endure a flight into space.
Whether he can deliver a child after such a flight.
"Anyone has not answered this question yet," says Vachtang Vachtang Vačnadze, a veteran of the rocket-space industry.
In June of 1964, more than a year after a space flight, Valentina Tereshkova, the first female-cosmonaut, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father was also cosmonaut Andryan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second-chick-cocksmoman Svetlana Savicka was born, who visited the orbit twice and who also worked in the open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts who have been born and are growing healthy offspring after many years.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even in the orbital flights," says the cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the fields of biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolaborator is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
Here, in conditions with zero appeal, the cosmonauts are learning the habits needed to work in the open space.
The water mimics weightlessness.
Though for adults, the water is even a comfortable but, in its own way, a strange environment, it is a natural element for young children.
The little ichicanders seem to confirm that life on the ground comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the child is in the mother's fetal water on average for 9 months and that it makes it easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first redeeming, only 2 weeks will pass.
"That's very little for a child to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, the Newborn Swimmer Envoyer.
In short - if a weightlessness condition is a more natural condition for a newborn baby, then for women the most natural is gravity, an attractive force.
In weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, decreases the body's ability to expel the fetus.
We can leave this aside if muscle activity stimulators in childbirth work work.
After all, it is possible for the birth to take place in a special chamber in which the mother's organism is banished by the fetus.
"What next?" Valery Poljakov asks the difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism does not have the gravity of the Earth, it cannot properly shape the skeleton or the system of muscles.
Newborne-track newborners are not allowed to dress as an adult in a special suit with a load in which to train.
He would simply be deprived of what he absolutely needed to develop him.
"If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in an alien environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be totally inadaptable to the local environment," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the IBMP bioethics commission.
So the birth of children in the universe today is just a theoretical issue.
But there comes a time when it will become a reality, and when the Earthlings will travel in their ships to a far-off planet that will become home to their descendants born in the universe.
SAO chief: Hazel-systermand control failed through politicians'
The Czech Republic has good auditors and high-quality legislation in connection with public contracts, but lags behind in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the vice-president of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, says so.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be right - that's what I think is missing from us," Kala comments on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also indicated by the joint control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he cites Petr Nečas's approach to the so-called "švarcsystem".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with his controls - is it forbidden or permitted?
"The law must be somehow set up, and if it prohibits something, even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which is obliged to go to check and enforce obligations," Kala says.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke of a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was going on?
This is a parallel check, which we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, the point is that European legislation regulates how to address public procurement, followed by individual national legislation and then also by the practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the control is not yet completed, we have shown very interesting differences - in general, the legislation is perhaps "more stricter and better" in our country, but the practice itself is better in some parameters.
It is confirmed, then, that it is not enough to create more and further precise rules, but it is necessary to address the actual application of the law.
What can this project actually help you do, what does it come from it?
It is such joint control that could contribute to the stop of efforts to refine the laws, reduce and improve the limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economicality means getting the right thing to be reasonable (which does not always mean the lowest) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But by lowering the contract limit, we do not necessarily achieve this.
Maybe the system will be overwhelmed with so much of the "paper" that those who want to look for holes in that system will draw on it a lot more easily than if the limit would stay higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with transposing public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is the office similar to our SAO, or is it set up differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, as the SAO operates there the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in the same way as we are, also has a college, only forming in a slightly different way, but in principle the two authorities are acting similarly.
The powers are also similar to a certain extent, but in the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so it has these accounting courts at the level of the various Länder - in this, the system differs a bit from ours.
The BRH can only control the federal money, represented by the state funds in our country.
Public funds that are managed by the counties and municipalities in our country are checked from the level of the federal accounting courts.
As far as the legislation there is, is that easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare it without specific data, however, in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly not to be said to be better at everything.
So is this also the fact that they have better controllers?
I'm sure I'm not, but I'm saying again, I don't like that kind of comparisons.
But it has to be said that even countries that we consider a role model face a whole range of problems.
Otherwise, it would be of no use to cooperate with our office, would it?
As for the domestic legislation, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, are there any effect on its effects?
Since the validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been reflected in the inspection events in our country.
Because we are doing ex-post checks, we need to expect some delays.
We only observe this so far in the process of preparing future inspections - we have kick-started our new "detachation of risk of inefficiency" through which we have laced almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there, of course, the changes will be reflected there, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tenders will be adjusted and the like.
Do you therefore consider the approval of this law to be more of an asset or a further burden on the red tape system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that's confirmed.
A problem that may arise here that the rules will be "stretched" and it will not be possible to comply with them.
Already under the functioning of the previous rules, the audited persons are bound by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes by the Regional Council) to the fact that any non-compliance with the Public Procurement Act entails a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it therefore worth tightening the law in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to challenge and abuse it, and not punish those who commit a formal misconduct that has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
How do you get out of it, then?
Let's show where the road is not.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs by inspecting the so-called 'chartagic' - and what does that mean?
Is the ŠvarcSystota forbidden or allowed?
After all, the law must be set up somehow, and if it does, if it does forbid something, then even the Prime Minister cannot prevent the work of the office, which is obliged to go to check and enforce obligations.
He can say, "We'll change the law and we'll pass it on," but he can't say we're going to act like nothing.
There are fairly strict rules in the Public Procurement Act on how what is to be done formally - which is rightly to protect the public tender.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the bidder with the best bid is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that is what I think is missing from us.
Roads are frosted in places, but mostly passable
In several parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frosted and also snowy.
But most of the roadways are passable, with caution somewhere.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary Region, the roads were passable this morning, but frosted in places and also snowy.
The temperature has dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to warm up slightly during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 centimetres of snow.
There was also lower visibility in places due to fog, according to data from the regional road workers' dispatch.
The R6 expressway and the first class roads are now open without restrictions in the region.
Caution is, however, in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
It is also possible to travel to the second and third class, including the mountain roads.
On them, however, in some sections still lie the remnants of frozen and some of the traveled snow.
Especially at higher altitudes, the ride should be paid extra attention.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of icing, on higher ground and on the mountains there may be a travelled layer of snow on the roads, the Road and Motorway Directorate informs on its website.
Road crews warn drivers of frost, it can form especially at the higher elevations of the Pardubice Region.
The ice can be in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysoké Mýto, especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Chemically, I/43 and I/34 at Svitav are treated.
Snow is mainly on the roads in the Giant Mountains and Eagle Mountains.
The hijacky snow layer is at the highest levels on the roads in the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today, the most often cloudy is clear-cut.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with a light wind.
Plzeň Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are passable this morning, but in places with increased caution and the ride needs to be adapted to the weather.
This is chilling in the morning, with temperatures ranging between three and nine degrees below freezing.
After previous snow and subsequent cooling, some of the roads may be frosted.
In places, drivers must also expect fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is clear from the information of the dispatcher of the regional road workers.
The D5 motorway is almost free of restriction, but the road manager is advised to be extra careful between the 80 to 131 kilometres.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Pilsen and Tachovsk, however, there may be frozen sections.
Second and third class communications are damp, and in this case, the frost-pressure warnings apply.
Drivers should be careful mainly on less frequented trips in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
The snow mash on the road must be counted today by drivers heading to the highest levels of the Olomouc Region.
After the chemical sprinkling, she remained on the Red Mountain saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videl Cross.
Road crews were driven into the terrain by snow at night, with snowing on Šumpersk, according to the travel managers.
In other parts of the county, the roads are mostly passable without restrictions.
"On Šumpersk, the remnants of snow lie at the highest levels.
The snow mash on the Red Mountain saddle must be counted by drivers in the direction of Jeseník," the dispatcher of the Šumperk Road Administration told the Czech Press Agency today.
Their colleagues set out in the field at night at the time, the roads up to the highest positions are now bare and wet after chemical treatment.
On Olomouck the roads are passable without restrictions, but on Šternbersko drivers should be careful in the forest sections where the roadways have remained damp.
Ústí nad Labem Region, Liberec Region
Several difficult-to-ticket locations are reported today in the morning by road workers in the north of Bohemia.
In addition to several places with fallen snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice to Ústí nad Labem is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are also held at lower altitudes below zero, so both ice and snow will probably last on the roads.In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
The operational complications are not yet reported.
The occurrence of the ice is reported by road crews mainly from the surroundings of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, conditions were ideal for her at night - rain and melting snow during the day, and clear at night and frosting.
From the main routes, unfavourable conditions are also reported on the I/13 road on the border of the Ústí and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Knínice was forced by bent tree branches, which bent to the pavement of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at concerts
What do you think of the end of the world coming to an end for less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarms that we humans like to catch on.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we make more of a joke about it and say that we are the only band in the world who can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you will organize a completely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to your readers?
This is a national fundraiser that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to tap into the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before 20 December from 21:00 will be held in parallel for 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time the Mayan calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, after which we invented everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to amass enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think, together with the public, about the state in which we will one day pass this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of items of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing at www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled."
Already today she is very popular on YouTube, will she also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, that is, if we can all do and the end of the world...
It is sung by all performers at all three concerts in parallel.
The anthems will suddenly also be linked in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
The words for this song were written and the lead role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tomáš Hanák, it is also sung by Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, given that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are trying to engage them intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and entertaining to work with us.
What will the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world go for?
To equip the barrier-free education centre Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in the Jedlička Institute.
For school students of the Jedlička Institute, lecturers regularly attend to them in activities they enjoy and interest.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers themselves, so we try to allow them to do so in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be created in the future to which we will move with this project.
Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
How did you choose them?
We were trying to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere will perform perform with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bangoo and Jiří Suchý.
Read all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar "omball events" for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, so we will certainly prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests here as well.
Next year we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, while we are in the US, I would like to link it to performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalist, you have performed so far in, for example, Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group made up of handicapped people.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it first appears.
We have five members on an electric cart, their carts have to travel in the luggage compartment, then of course we are lugging with us a large number of cargo and boxes of tools...
However, so far it has always been done without any problems, with CSA and British Airways both beautifully prepared for us that I have wondered how many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we came back recently, it was no problem.
With trips abroad, you can compare how the different ones differ in barrier-free, public access to the handicapped and the like.
What have you encountered so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than ours, we have just seen in Russia that everything is still in the very beginning in the east.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is very barrier-free, here it is still unusual for a person on an electric cart to move in the city centre.
It is not even of such obvious that you prefer wheelchair users in the lift.
Fortunately, civic associations are already being formed there, too, to try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way, on the other hand, do we still have to catch up with more mature countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
But it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In both London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy handicap to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, to wherever...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this we are a little bit ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or barrier-free is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will start to change in the first place.
So far, these are isolated cases of people with a strong will.
The band The Tap Tap is now very popular, but let's go back a few years since you made you start it in 1998?
I joined as a tutor at the Jedlička Institute, where I had many young people around who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play, among other things, the saxophone, I started a special-interest music club with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our presenter Lada Angelovich says, it got a little out of hand (laughter).
But the popularity came only in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with the well-known singers and also to actively work to promote the band.
We realized that a job that you can't see really doesn't seem to exist.
In addition, thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to make it this high with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something differently.
Showbusiness is crowded with things where one mimics another.
It's kind of logical, everything new is accepted cautiously, and it takes a long time.
Things that are unique are very few, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression in the person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, that's natural...
But the regret is completely in vain, because the handicap people are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we must regret.
These are people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, the means to do so.
I say that when people with a handicap get something right, it's not just a shift for them, it's for the whole of society.
Did this success also be the fact that you are a strict boss, as many people have called you?
When we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising about many things and demand a certain discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic image and a head in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to the exam twice the week, attend the product and spend a lot of time on the road to the concerts, the enthusiasm quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
The band Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were at her beginnings in 1998?
Only one Lada Angelovic.
We're an open group, people are leaving and coming, you can't be prevented from doing that.
Whoever has the will and the taste always has the door open with us
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 pm
It will take place in Prague Incheba Arena, Brno Fléda and Ostrava Plynojemu with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities will be connected by the telemost at the end of the evening while singing the song of the band The Tap Tap "The World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to collect funds to equip the multifunctional barrier-free educational centre STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 have free tickets in the pre-sales Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at a ministerial ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in a number of of Agency projects over the following years.
However, Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
The flight to space was attended to by Polish enthusiasts before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I will mention, for example, the A. Šternfelda in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on 6 December 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work The Entrance to Space.
The ideas of a young engineer (b. 1905) left the listener cold and after years Šternfeld recalled that only dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hircha Award for the Go to Space in France.
The recalled Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and spaceflight.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-famous promoter of spaceflight, and his contribution was also praised by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named by his name.
Already in 1925 a railroad was built in Poland, which was to be fitted with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the rocket was to be used to run the torsion or to brake it.
The information about this trench is only known from the period press.
From 1933 missile missiles began to be preoccupied with Polish artillery.
The research was provided by Komórka Technicii Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfk and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the preserved materials that the research has reached the stage of the age-old exams.
However, the arrival of the German troops was interrupted by the research.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the professional press, and in the following year the work of Rakieta - the torpedo powietrzna and the rakietobomba of the lotbook by the author Leliwy-Krzywoblocký was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all military-use projects of missile technology were addressed by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, its activities ceased the start of the war.
Other work devoted to spaceflight appears in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautycz).
It is first mentioned in the November issue of the 1954 magazine Problems, in which there are four more comprehensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicz, is proposed to create a company to deal with spaceflight.
By then, artificial satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) of the Polish Astronautical Society (founded 1951) and became a full member in the autumn.
And in the following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful Meteorological rocket RM (Racieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10. October 1958.
The missile with a range of 1,800 metres was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
An improved version of the RM-1A was later built, and in the summer of 1959, the flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 missile were launched in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
Another development type should have been capable of real scientific work by now - the RM-34 rocket was to have a range of up to 14.5 km and was tasked with tracking the altitude wind.
However, in 1962 further development was suspended.
The first RM rockets were the A Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage, total length of 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (marked by Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, differing in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
In the Meteor-1A rocket, a 0.4-litre space, a Meteor-1B 0.34-litre Meteor-1C and a 0.62-litre Meteor-1C was available.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the AMet-2, a Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Auschwaiti Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, versions of the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
Poland also became involved in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmaut after Vladimir Remko.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not the solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court has annulled the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively public debate.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as in a globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that the various economic units, the national economic systems, stand in a permanent conflict between themselves.
The cause is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, along with the unriadulterous financial speculation.
As a result of significant differences in the price of labour, (gatherages) there is a price voltage.
This is to understand the situation where the producer tries to compete by importing cheap goods by "undercutting" the price of a competitor in order to tear down a greater market share and thereby increase its own profits by importing the price of the competitor.
On a massive scale, this means either transferring production to foreign countries or buy cheaply or to disappear there.The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
As private capital has no social responsibility and thus the responsibility for its unemployment, social spending is necessarily rising.
The whole situation is heightened by the total reluctance of the entrepreneurs' masters to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social-wide damage he has done in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to provide specific statistical data.
Reckless private capital practices create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to enter into a mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are putting private capital on their own populations, regardless of the social downturn.
This is particularly reflected in changes to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force their own population to adopt a price dictate of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done both by the economic coercion system in the case of long-term unemployment and by restricting workers' rights in the field of labour law.
The result is rising poverty, along with an increase in the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food outlets for many years for the poor, who cannot make a living from their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
Increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are quite common cases of duly employed people receiving such a wage that the state must pay them to the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal was also made public in the case of the auxiliary staff of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures by virtually all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same state, with people being forced to either emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic social-level slump, or to languish for hunger wages on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital might one day come to the country.
But here it is necessary to ask how to come from, however?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, or a Turk, a Moroccan, or an Egyptian, or an African, still work for a fraction of Europe's wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to the bottom of their grip argue that the state cannot participate in capital in its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital admonarily insists on the view that the state must not interfere with the economy by the management of the interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether it affects private capital, now actually governs the policy and thus the whole state in its own egotistical sense.
Here is the unequivocal answer that it is.
The proof is of virtually omnipotent existence and in all states the ubiquitous lobby.
The result is a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, by providing mutual benefits, by legislating, where virtually everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is that the state ministries, for lack of funds, are commissioning drafting bills to private law firms that are often related to the industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All of the power comes not from the people, as the Western-style institutes proclaim, but from financially strong groups who prefer their own interests.
It is clear that liberal-leaning democracies are now rapidly in the situation, as described by Appiános in its work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompey:" The state has long been in complete decay and the authorities have been enrilling by force.
For bribes, illegal acquiring favor and with the help of stones or swords.
Bribing and corruption ramped up without any inhibitions, and the people went to the polls with a pre-sold voice" ..."characteristic people didn't apply for the office at all, so that once, as a result of this disruption, the state was without consuls".. .."It has begun to be a real talk about the fact that the only remedy in the evil situation is self-government and that you need to elect an energetic man.." While Appiános thought of Pompeius, it became Caesar, who changed to a permanent democracy for self-rule.
Conclusion As in antiquity, the current society is based on a reckless preference for self-evident advantage, regardless of the society-wide interest.
By its very nature, the private capital is no longer able to understand and exercise the society-wide benefit.
The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence of the elites without any effort to reform a deeper nature.
The caucus of the advent of both fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalisation of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As things stand, the demise of these systems in favor of liberal-style democracy can be seen as a kind of break with the expectation of the next round.
What is particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites are completely ignoring the possible hundreds of thousands of dollars of loss of life, humanitarian and social disasters in the future, which we are already witnessing with the crimes against humanity as we know them from both old and new histories.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under pressure from competition both at the international and domestic European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to further reduce the social population's level.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political-cocial reforms that will boost the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"There will be no violence and there will never be a way out of violence" Sting in the song Fragile, whose main line in the chorus is "let's forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would be no "died" dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, a lot of reactions have arisen, as always.
One stands behind Israel, arguing for his right to self-defense, and cast the Palestinians as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is cast as a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about who is the culprit in the periodic repetitive waves of killing and who is the victim, after all, today's people of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
It is my intention to offer readers a view of the curtain, a view of who, above all, has served the already 95-year-long tension (counted since the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by the available historical facts some of them are derived from the basis of my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
Humanity's history is, first and foremost, a struggle for power.
In each epoch we can track down one of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so evident is whether it was always these personalities who governed their actions in an absolutely autonomous manner, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to the pre-claimed goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have happened in the lifetime of a generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families, one stands out who might consider herself the head of the octopus (if anyone is still standing over them I don't know, but I'm not ruling it out) - the Rothschields.
There's not much written about them.
Of course.
They bought the first press agency (Reuters) back in the 1890s to stop the association of their name with the highly criminal deeds they were behind, which always meant for them to consolidate power, multiply wealth, or both.
They have the main stakes in almost every central bank of the world, and against countries where shares in the central bank are not fought or are being pre-fronched wars (before attacking Afghanistan, it was 5 countries after the attack on Iraq, with only four left after the overthrow of Gaddafi, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore central bank status to the Rothschield Bank of America, began to issue his own (meaning government) money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in the theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the FED, was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for launching a major economic crisis in 1929.
Their desire for global power led to the formulation of the plan of the three world wars by the Masonic of the High, 33rd stage dedication to Albert Pik, from 1859 to 1871.
The first war was tasked with removing the large monarchist state states in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial domineering of Great Britain in particular, and the third is to lead to a reduction in the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number of slaves are enough for their convenience and luxury and not consume as many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a forearm for such a solution) and a final takeover of absolute power.
The method worked by a group of the richest families, headed by the Rothschchielda, is to trigger the crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order from the chaos).
But these solutions are bogic and always lead to a deterioration in the situation (see the founding of the FED to avoid a repeat of the crises like the one they brought about in 1907).
So after they succeeded in assassining the Habsburg successor to the R-U throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, to launch the First World War, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, military and economically unfounded, surrender of Germany (no longer needed a war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and subsequently the Central European power, Austria of Hungary, was fragmented.
To make it easier for the Second World War, the bankers of the politicians had a latent conflictual situation created by imminenting the proposed reparations on Germany, thus creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then all they had to do was undermine the Germans to the Germans, identifying and simple solutions to offer the Führer, as well as the creation of a multinationality of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and also played, the function of the fifth column, in igniting the war fire.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschields instilered the founding of the Zionist Movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the historical Judea region with Jerusalem as its capital (returnee to Sion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, with the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
World War II broke out, if Hitler went off the rails, on which international bankers initially held him, or all he did was hard to gauge, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, like Germany's war reparations were set for World War II, the declaration of the state of Israel created an outbreak of war in the Third.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, like the latter, will be a first-line victim in the fighting, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only within the country, but also internationally (let's just take the sharply divide people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds a grievance in an endless chain of violence, when at the beginning of everything was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the simple people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers are betting on people to choose from the elections exclusively to their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel's hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of the fascist, the loyal international bankers, a politician who is doing his utmost to start a war with Iran that, would, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threaten to escalate into a global conflict and, given Iran's control over the Hormuz Strait, through which 20% of all world's oil (the navigation corridor is only 2 miles wide) as well as the destruction of the world's global climate.Economies.
In what light now appear to be the words that David Rockefeller uttered in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to the new world order."
The new world order in their imagination is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newborn person is implanted at birth with a chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"And it forces all the small and the great, the rich, and the poor, the free, and the slaves to have a brand on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell who is not marked by the name of the beast or the digit of her name.
This needs to be understood: who has the mind to add the digits of the beast.
The number indicates a person, and it's the number six sixty-six."
The film Argo: When the Wor's Earnest is, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted Shaha, Mohamed Réza Páhlavi, who fled to the US, who had been the patron saint of his regime for decades after the revolution.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive way out - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because it would thus fundamentally threaten trust with allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostage in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was unable to achieve it.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The jingled diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after the negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran contributed greatly to Jimmy Carter's loss to Ronaldo Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film directed by actor Ben Affleck Argo describes one episode of the history that brought America a minor victory.
Just before the embassy was taken over, six employees fled.
After difficult periods, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went to Canadian passports as members of a film crew who surveyed the country's loot for the set of sci-fi big films in the country.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the legend credible, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, the fictitious production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have long been kept secret, with the film based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time a so-called "caper movie," a story of a successful piece, a set of screw-ups - an example is the Danny's Partners series.
The film thus alternates with moods - on the one hand, the documentarious sequences from Tehran (in the captive sequence, the iconic period photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were demonstrated in the film are shown - there are no big differences in this).
On the other side of the lightweight passages from Hollywood, dealt with irony and a mild exaggeration.
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the meeting tables, in the hallways of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck's remarkable career reboot was successful.
He became a respected director from the mocked actor, and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, following the dark crime Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also the first of Affleck's first film to take place in the director's home home city of Boston.
The sense of the space's atmosphere was among the characteristics that the director's older films elevated the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Argo, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the embassy's collapse is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the emotion of the confusion and recklessness that occurs when history moves out of nowhere.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (a false staff at the Tehran Bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told doesn't actually offer much in the film's sense of thrilling scenes.
He's almost working with it quite successfully, sometimes making up for reality - things don't work out so gracefully there anymore (a scene in which the imminent crisis at Tehran airport averts a phone call in America and a runway chase quite far-fetched).
But the weakness of Argo is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters deserve more space and are far from the only one in the film.
Affleck's film kind of loses its dramatic move, a film that can be watched with mild interest, to appreciate the realisation as well as the retro style evoking the thrillers of the 1970s.
But it will be hard to tear down.
As a reminder of one in a way of living history to date, as well as a testament to how exaggerated the notions of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, but suffice.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and a circus
www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually announces the poll for the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a contest for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU."
"We were led by the last event where the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the management of large European companies," the poll organizer, Patrik Nacher, told Právo.
Among the absurdities nominated, for example, is the recent European Court's ruling on the unification of insurance premium rates for men and women.
So far, women have been favoured in life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher informed.
The controversial EU regulation includes, for example, the mandatory incorporation of bio-constellins into fuel, which is a detriment to nature as a result, as a result, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers simply because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substance, or a directive on the size of the hen cages, which has made eggs soar this year.
Critics were also previously faced with a virtual ban on the use of the term pomegranate butter or the elimination of conventional light bulbs from sale.
High-quality bananas are supposed to be 14 centimetres
The Union apparatus often makes decisions under pressure from one trade or another industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic now also promotes the demands of its banks by the threat of a veto).
The lobby's interest was also behind the fact that, for example, highest-quality bananas in the Union had to be at least 14 cm long and were not allowed to exhibit an "anomal curvature."
The European Commission defended itself by merely harmonising the inconsistent national standards to date, which made trading more difficult.
Standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU, despite opposition from some states, pointing out that existing directives lead to food waste.
The candidate to win the poll may also be last year's EU regulation, according to which the inflatable balloons must be a mandatory warning that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate without the supervision of adults.
The EU has referred to US research here, saying that balloons among toys are a leading cause of death for children to ash.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 when blowing into fairgrounds.
Curious ideas are also born at home
Quite absurd, then, is the rule concerning the European officials themselves - anyone with an official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia with regard to the sensitivity of the topic to Greece and must speak instead of the FYROM (Former Republic of the League of Macedonia).
Bankruptic.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of a Member State for the survey, in addition to some of the above absurdities.
The EU has set the maximum volumes of food stocks that may have been in the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes for canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a heavy fine.
The poll's organizers were also taken to the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea and the idea of awarding subsidies to receive subsidies.
However, these ideas were not made in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped by the fact that we have no sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He stated as an argument that a lot of grain was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called interventionary purchases, the state was to be full of warehouses, which it had to export.
For the Czech Republic's continued to reach the ports, the EU was to pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission eventually reached out to the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for the grant was offered to the municipality by the Ministry of Regional Development, run by Minister Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), namely to write an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, EU regulatory efforts and, at the same time, the Union's entire functioning and development of the whole Union deserve more recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, experts say, is the drawing of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced by the Member States in budget negotiations.
The emotion among Czechs is also aroused by the fact that, like other countries of the Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to specific designations of its traditional products in Brussels, while it does not always succeed in this match.
Although the Czechs defended the designation of Olomouc shapes after a six-year fight with the Germans and Austrians, but the domestic rum, the tradition of which dates back to the 19th century in our country, had to be renamed our producers domestic.
The name of the rum can only be carried by cane spirit products and not from sugar beet.
In the official EU registered product list, the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheese, marzipan from Lübeck, Germany, or Parma ham, have already found them, for example, Karlovy Vary's sucharch, mountain and Třeboň carp and Houthi hops.
The EU's trademark can then also boast Pardubice gingerbread and bitter tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says
Senator, how does it occur to you that you want to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it works in our country without any problems, I'm not running for anything.
But I can no longer watch the country steal from the last twenty years, the thieves run around, people's taxes and retirement ages rise.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I've turned 40 and I'm an independent outsider, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate, but you soon set off for the Castle.
Aren't you going to turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle, depending on the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, the function is a tool for how I can make my visions happen.
That is why I need as much influence as I can and the strongest possible mandate.
But the problem is not only that we swear as a nation in the pub and in front of the TV, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
This will be compounded by the media, which defame a person and which confuse freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was said to be bribing journalists or being an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
In the battle for the Castle, you set out with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and the rewards of over twenty million.
You have to change the law for that.
As a president, however, you do not have that authority, and only the Senate as a whole can draft laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I lobbied as a citizen for guingressing to be a free business, it was passed.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, they are deliberately rejected, and that is delayed by the citizens.
As an independent outsider, I have much greater potential to gain support from all the parliamentary parties.
My preference is that without party labeling and dogma, I can take something that is best for our country, from each side, and apply it.
Do you see yourself more as a right-wing or a left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank me more to the left.
It's not important to me at all whether it's a little to the left or a little to the right.
It's important to me that we go forward.
I don't care whether someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
I will always support any public-favorable solution, even if it is proposed by the KSČM or ODS, and I will also be against the wrong idea.
You're the devil when someone says you're a populist.
But aren't you proving it with what you said?
When you're a business plan at a company, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
And you're trying to get close to that.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world, or were spoken of by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, all you have left is the slogans.
And with that, you don't get away with it in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, that you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
To persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to get it through.
If I were elected president, it is not a problem to hold a televised live broadcast, where I will ask the heads of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually have to say why they didn't want it.
If a strong personality is called a misconception, one can push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was a credit to public pressure.
I'm being an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to find allies.
I have only just started in politics and I will try to win majority support for my agenda.
I try to move things by myself, if I can't, I'll quit in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saviour.
I know I won't do anything in one person, so I've been circling a number of well-known people to see if they'd run for the Senate, too.
I went to see Radim Jančura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the scams of light fuel oils.
I ran, saying people were really unhappy, but now I'm on the fumble.
Sixty percent of people didn't vote, and those who went mostly elected establishment leaders.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate to make it difficult to enforce the changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering starting your own party?
I haven't even considered that yet, because I don't have the time to check every potential party member's clean past, and I don't have the money for it either.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
No money?
You're talking about asset declarations, what's yours?
I estimate private property to about 60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land for roughly 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of artworks for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a one-million-dollar Skoda Superb, and then I have a couple of million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - I've always liked James Bond, who drove in the car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against wrongdoing and mischief.
You're riding an Aston Martin, you've got $60 million worth of assets, and you don't have campaign money?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Am I going to get into debt?
I've already flown into the campaign for 2.5 million.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors is indicative of the fact that I don't think there's much interest in my program.
And I'm not obliged to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign costs will basically be covered by the kind of senator's salary I'll be.
But I wouldn't make it out of it, for example, I wouldn't be able to pay my son an English school that costs 30 grand a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I'd not be running for office.
So you're going to keep in business to live?
Didn't you say you would dampen these activities?
But that has nothing to do with the salary level.
As promised, I partially dampened my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the manager of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan to be the Republic.
But I need to live on something, too.
How much was you used to taking monthly as a businessman?
Two to 400,000, which I'll keep taking.
And if I were president, I would have quit my business.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Law.
The architects of the MVRDV are proof that real adventures are not just played in the head - for example, by Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books - 2 images
"The building seems cheerful to me, it looks futuristic. Finally, there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks along the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician in a nearby big business, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
But I ask what we need a library for today.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
None of these old-style libraries are now volunteering, do they?
Spijkenisse, a housing estate in close proximity to Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which is not worth a visit, holds a special record.
This municipality of 80,000 inhabitants exhibits the lowest level of education in the whole of the Netherlands.
To resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago, a decision was made to contribute to general education and build seven nicely painted reinforced concrete miniatures of the fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes.
But the success of the educational offensive was not staggering.
And so the city councillors recognized that there was only one way to become the masters of the statistics: we must have a library!
Wina Maas of the Rotterdam architectural studio MVRDV, a master of insanely daring bar charts and a contractor of witty, often even cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual calm, and at a competition meeting in 2003 he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission was still looking around in amazement and shrug, the insolent Maas piled up his gifts to himself according to his size and ended his activist-justified speech by saying, "The City of City Municipality!"
So this is my proposal for the Books Mountain in Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain was piled up.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and several adjoining residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.
In early November, the Mountain of the Book was honoured with the second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small-town grayness, which has so far been unable to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is richer a bit of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Journey to the Book
First impression: reader eldorado under the cheese hatch.
The middle of the mountain massif is the lift, but you will discover real spatial and reader passions only when you hitchhike topography.
From all sides the glass-winkered interior is bright and clear, the ground from a baked cabinet and an elegant street lantern clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and the boys and girls who play football.
And books, books, books.
"Normally there are shelves with books along the facade and in the middle there is a large dark space that is mostly unpopular and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We set the classic spatial configuration upside down and we slid the space for the readers out from the inside.
The interior of the Mountain of the Books is skilfully used: offices, the internet library, the chess club, the environmental centre and the home technology centre are located on Wednesday.
A special delight are the black shelves for books, which are one wall-panech, one sill of the windowsill and sometimes by the railings of the stairs.
The appearance, structure and smell are alien.
The unknown building material is even shaken by the headers of the sworn architects and civil engineers.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the city's Spijkenisse municipality, when asked by Standard magazine.
And so, in a frish farm, we came across a suitable agricultural waste product in a day.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a millimeter fleece of synthetic matter has been used as a basis under the roots.
It is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, and then is ripe for being thrown into bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantities - was pressed to boobs four centimeters in a thickness.
By the action of the heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) colours in a dark, homogeneous and loadable material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
The 105 steps take you to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long journey, you will be rewarded in a literary café with not only a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
These take care of the atmosphere, but mainly the right humidity of the air in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You probably wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite many glass surfaces, is a showcase project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It heats and cools with the heat of the Earth.
Although the Mountain of the Books stands under the glass cover, the sun shines in only a short time, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden trusses, which stand perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as shade and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest can be handled by fully automatic shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes Boekenberg as the "home-anticipated soul" of Spijkenisse.
Reason: Every city dweller was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate a book from his personal fund.
This should have first been filled with optical gaps in the not-yet-not-equipped library, which currently holds 70,000.
The concept worked.
The shelves are completely full.
"There's nothing worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident has a particular relationship with the new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for the ornament.
This has done so for the MVRDV in the royal discipline, which is called the formation of identity in the professional jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
Be that young and uneducated.
This is ultimately the starting point for identity.
Szabo: 'Germans must play a bigger role'
Germany abstained from voting to decide on the adoption of Palestine.
According to the US-Europe-Europe expert, Stephen Szabo, Berlin is teetering on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier in the week that it would vote against the proposal to observe the Palestinians' status of the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
What for?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, of course, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think he's going to support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was eventually pushed through by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason for this is that it is changing its foreign policy, away from a policy that was run by the US, so to speak, towards German foreign policy.
The situation is made all the more difficult by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are therefore between the two queues.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just settling in their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy as they have in France or the UK.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows readiness to take on national interests as well as positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. export and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to some extent, different from the economic interests of other great powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests affect the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
It must therefore be cautious that it does not scare off the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
That's a factor.
But I wouldn't want to give it much importance either, it's not a very one-sided relationship.
In any case, however, it plays a significant role in the German deliberations.
Did Germany's relations with the US hurt when Germany abstained from voting in the two important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That is why I do not think it was as dramatic a turning point as it was in the issue of Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even benefit from it a certain respect.
This signals that it must be regarded as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The US, on the other hand, was clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European peoples?
These differences have always existed as a result of American internal politics.
I think the Obama administration is in secretly very sympathetic to the European position.
But, as a result of the political situation there, he cannot, of course, take this position publicly.
I don't think the differences of opinion really are at all as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all very excited about Netanyahu's policies.
Isn it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think this is exactly what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they cannot be part of the wider line and must instead drive things forward from their own position.
That's what they're doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does he even want to take the lead?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still unaccustomed to this, it is still unpleasant, and it is still difficult for this country to play a bigger role for obvious reasons.
For example, when we look at the European crisis, every time Germany accepts a bigger role, there are anti-German sentiments.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
It's actually an old problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be acceptable to all sorts of neighbours and opinions, and that's not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now steadily decreasing, but the EU does not currently fill out this vacuum. Who else is left?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they're uncomfortable and they'll make them the most popular - c'est la vie!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, the Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this lies the designation, which is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection until they are sung by the brand's real owners.
Nor is it then clear whether they will enforce the law.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing office specializing in abuses of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters need only a few extra letters to sign up on their brands.
The Gucci brand, for example, becomes Lu-Gucci and has Prada-Kny registered instead of Prada-Kny.
In this way, German companies, like the maker of sportswear Puma, are also legally copied.
Pattloch opens a binder with records of a stamp office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had a Zegna DF Puma brand protected. An artificial name that also parasites on the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and transfining intellectual property.
There are multi-story department stores in large cities in which counterfeits are sold almost exclusively.
But the Pattloch cases are different. On behalf of its mandants, it is acting against Chinese firms officially receiving from the trade mark exchange office the right to use the label that is already sheltered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai," an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan."
This is the meaning of women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any guilt.
"It's damage done by the store, we have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The sign gets diluted, the exclusive status disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and court costs of the affected industries run into the millions, especially for expensive exemplary products.
According to data from market research company CLSA, China, with a year's third largest market for luxury goods and a market growing fastest, is growing the fastest.
However, the deletion of the dubious records in the sign register is difficult to achieve and it is a rationale.
The proceedings can stretch to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases in which the court dismissed the lawsuits because the title was "market reality" after the long term.
When the plaintiff is unlucky, he has to pay the plagiarist because he has damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
The well-known cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German giant pumps for the Putzmeister concrete mixture.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought the Volvo, originally used a blue and white logo that resembled a BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion product manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to forgeries from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the well-known crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are unaware of any guilt.
The CTMO Stamp Office admits that there were deficiencies there in 2010 because of too few staff and premises.
But last year, the supposedly "run of the workforce has returned to normal from an emergency situation."
For example, the number of unprocessed Senate proceedings fell by 22 percent.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, there are still 81,500 complaints pending at the office.
Something to do against it is expensive
As is often the case in China, they are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and it means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the 10th consecutive year.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected in fees.
In simple terms, this means that each sign-in costs on average €1h0,06 yen.
It is worth several times the dispute to start against this, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
This concern has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
The Germans have achieved the cancellation of its illegal production of imitated car parts.
However, the forger secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would neglect this ourselves, as the surname cannot be protected in Germany, says Hanna Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO stamp office then also rejected the Munich firm's objection.
In the other two instances, while Freudenberg obtained the rights, the opponent continues to fight in the dispute to this day.
You need to be very careful
The matter is now being heard in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will bring a good conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The controls are extremely expensive and cost us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the company's archives, they even had to inspect the 100-year-old files to present evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposing party in vain a "high six-seater euro-six-seat amount" to settle the dispute.
"That's how you see what it means to us," Wentzler says.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will also hit Europe.
And that's when the imitators there secure unprotected brands.
One Chinese manufacturer, for example, wanted to sign in the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather in Germany.
The group gave up this business area a long time ago, yet it was able to avert registration.
"You need to be careful," Wentzler says.
He and the lawyer, Pattloch, advise German businesses to be very careful when trading with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights. Rather, foreigners would have "everything that is worth protecting, to enroll in China, to enroll in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg succumbs to its brand drama in the last act, then it will probably have to pay the opposing party's royalties for its own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we'll be pressured from the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Fight Day: stomping, singing, helping
At Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is being tested - and in the Svazijsk, orphans are happy about it from their parents who died of AIDS.
The story of the connection, which surpasses much more than 8733 kilometres.
First there's the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's loafers, they're looking for tact in the dance floor and find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers - the alto, the bass, the tenor and the soprano - are slowly rising, and they are chasing each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf is almost lifted from his textile shoes as he joins the voices with his suppleer wild gestures.
It's Monday night. At the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
There were fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from a researcher in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different text and a very foreign language - a zulu spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesoth, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Helping to Self-Help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Anti-AIDS program, estimates that there are some 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of this, 23.5 million are in the south of Africa.
In Svazijsk, there are 245,000 orphans from their parents who died of AIDS.
HIV-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend a second-grade school.
For €15 or €20 a month, patronage can be taken over.
He guides a child's tuition fee, school uniform and one hot meal a day at the Gogo-centre.
Imbongi means "story-to-doctor" in the zul language, or "the one who praises."
In fluke bantu, no one can speak in this space, just to sing.
For almost a decade, he has been rehearsing the chorus of the song in this foreign soft language, and occasionally also brings them back to where they originally come from: to the south of Africa.
At an aerial distance of 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, the village of Esitjeni is in the northeast of the Republic of Swimming, which is dependent on the bulk of the voices of the German corps.
Forty percent are infected
There are roughly 2,000 people living there, some still in plain clay or straw huts. A large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, as they have succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjen, you can see in a small way, what the whole of Swavia's: the highest HIV infectivity, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcise of the male forecorest, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, does not accept the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaison wear the weakened immunity virus in themselves. It is no rarity that they die at the age of less than 30.
This village was discovered by the congregation on a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005. Above all, Imbongi members saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a completed school education, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
At first, it was still a private deployment of individuals who, for a few euros a year, allowed the child to be sent to school and given him one hot meal a day.
However, a year later, a chorus of the "Voices for Africa" association was founded, taking care of orphans from their parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
Which are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial SPI includes syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhog (gonorea).
Common viral SPI are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
The men and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found primarily in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four of all the syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases occur frequently occurring are chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candis (swim), gonorrhea and human papilomavir.
HIV is prevalent among heterosexual adults in the Czech Republic, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV are this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections involve young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, there are often human papillomavi among the teens.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of syilphilis infections, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled to 3698 illnesses in 2011 from 1697 of the disease in 2001.
The number of people with new HIV-infected people has been decreasing since 2007.
There were about 2700 cases in 2011.
That's about one-tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms highlight the venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the field of the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and will therefore remain unnoticed.
How can we protect yourself?
Dangers of the disease can be reduced by condoms, but do not offer 100% protection.
For the agents of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially passed on to infection from impurities and narrow physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations and, last but not least, the royalties the choir earns by singing all over Germany, some money is collected.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjen," says the association's president, Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself, a confident woman who can assert herself.
It also takes care of orphaned children finding shelter, such as some of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the zulu language is called old women, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have taken in 14 orphans, have given them a roof over their heads and are making sure the children arrive in uniform on time for school every day.
Children who no longer have no one go to the shelter to Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid for by the club as well as the two cooks that cook for more than 200 hungry children a day.
In addition, the "Voices for Africa" set up a sewing school, built two chicken cogs, and together with the American health organization PSI arranged that many people in the village had an HIV test taken.
It's not a given. Though the disease is so obvious throughout the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because he's dealing with sexuality."
In fact, rather strange in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolutist monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his unmitigating lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-sanctioned way of life is also to blame, among other things, for the HIV virus to have spread so rapidly in the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who spread the virus around the country.
Annette Lennartz says that while condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse.'
To support the cultural exchange at least a little, the Imbongi choir travels together in the south of Africa once every two, three years together, and sings songs full of grief, belligerence, confidence in the future and self-confidence of the black, which many in the southern tip of the black continent know from the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the language of blacks - such an appreciation brings not only the mood and joy, but has also already shed tears from many wild frontier soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjen, where the singers visit children over whom they have patronage.
Although this village is hard to find on the maps, it is more than familiar in the Ezulweni River valley.
"Go to Esitjen, there's light," the people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is from here as the crow flies 8733 kilometers, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Straße, you see that the light is shining here.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe found evidence that ice was on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be in the thickness of up to 20 metres.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published by the expert magazine "Science" on Thursday.
The Messenger probe has found evidence for the fact that there is an ice sheet in the area of this planet, which lies in a sustained shadow.
This is reportedly at least 30 centimetres and possibly even up to 20 metres thick.
This water seems to have come from the comets, or perhaps even from the asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let's not link the discovery of ice to the existence of life on this planet, said the head of the scientists working on the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach as much as 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help us explain how water and other basic elements of life have reached other regions of the solar system.
Probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, unoccupied Earthlings, are taking part in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, images are sent to Earth, small windows into endless distances.

Like Pluto, which circles the sun behind Neptune, Ceres, according to the new conceptual definition of the International Astronomical Union, is not a "planet" in the International Astronomical Union.
This cutout from the infrared film of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of the innermost generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue points, the less identifiable are the pink-colored "novoroonbates" in the star's delivery room.
This area where stars are formed - scientists call it a W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This shining heat of the dying star was captured by the NASA Spitzer Telescope.
The widow-shaped ring consists of material ejected by the star during the dying process.

One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: the vortex galaxy
The images of the spiral galaxies become the real works of art, according to their colouring.
The shot, released by the European Southern Observatory, depicts several thousand light-leaking light-years-long Trifid nevorin in the constellation of the Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (distributed to three parts, tricendered), as the dark strips of dust divide the glowing heart of this stellar maternity maternity hospital into three parts.
In the constellation of Hadonosh, astronomers photographed a precursor to cosmic clashes: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies, and there must inevitably be a collision.
This birth of the star was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Anyone who does not like technical shortcuts can call it the nickname South Windrinder.
A photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope shows the Iris cutout of the Tornades in the constellation Ceffe.
This 1,400 light-year-old nebula is made up of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It depicts a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spirital galaxy is called UGC by scientists in the 1810.
This star nebula features the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to new additions.
Also, this stellar cloud, coupled with the Rosette Nebula Nebula, is still giving birth to new young stars. They are 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, but only gas.
Scientists believe it was only created shortly after the Big Bang when it was mostly hydrogen throughout the universe.
Our Views of Space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was reportedly invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608. A year later, Galileo, Galilei used it to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown ever larger - and the views they convey are becoming deeper and deeper.
It was the world's largest telescope for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture was five metres in diameter.
In the American Arizona stands the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows a glimpse into space through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures 10.4 metres in diameter.
The Mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Still, its diameter is roughly eleven meters.
Inadvantage of the inexpensive method of design: the telescope is provided with a hook-up at a height angle, thus limiting its mobility.
The height angle is also fixated by the Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas.
Its peculiarities are the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, will be equal to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecib (Portoriko), scientists in the universe are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
With "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - a search for extraterrestrial intelligence - any computer owner who makes his computing power available can help.

It says the Very Large Telescope - and does honor to his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can shine through the medium infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large telescope is also planned for the ESO Chile Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be full 42 metres and is to be composed of almost 1,000 mirrored elements.
However, the images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Two Keck's telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten metres.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, in addition to them, peers into space with the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
Also on Mauna Kea, a new giant telescope is to be created - with a 30-meter diameter of the mirror.
Here you can admire it in the picture.
But the most significant impressions of space are conveyed to us by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Footage of distant worlds has been provided to us since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
2. In February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 candidate planets had been detected since the start of the mission.
The picture shows the last preparations before the Kepler space telescope is launched.
The James Webb Space Teoples (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard the Ariane5 rocket as early as 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope is 6.5 metres in diameter.
One of the telescopic tasks is to find the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that there is ice even at the South Pole of Mercury.
For this, however, there are no reliable data, as Messenger circles around this planet much closer to the North Pole.
The radar measurement had been showing for decades that there was ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, the scientists are now confident.
Drink butter a day and you'll live to be 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to be of the biblical age.

Searching for clues in a country where 97-year-old people are still relatively young.
Riding the mountains of Talyš we can call it wildly romantic.
The minibpore rattles down the road with many curves along densely forested hills, ferocious rivers and plain peasant buildings.
Everything is green and juicy, we almost seem to be in the Schwarzwald.
However, this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. The border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here, the Talyshoi ethnic group, which is not well known, lives here, in addition to speaking perfectly Persian and Azerbaijan and living to a very old age.
The final station is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which is somehow not suited to the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours at 323 kilometres because the road is only one-lane.
The fairy-tale wealth that the land owes to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived at the country.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that Lerik has the guts to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was made famous by the Eurovision Grand Prix in May - and we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world here next year," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the longevity museum, probably the only one in the world.
This is where the lives of nearly eight dozen Talyšs from the surrounding area are documented, who are over the age of a hundred years. Fatulajeva shows a black and white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 133, he still fathered a child.
The disputed star of this museum, however, is the sheep shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who was believed to be 168 years old.
The birth certificate, however, does not exist.
And given that the oldest person with papers was 122 years old, Müslürov's age seems extremely dubious.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulalayva explains.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he is said to have fathered a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov, at his age, befused by a few decades?
But he also heard about the aged people in Central Asia, Rembrandt Scholz, the gerontologist of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
"Conderly many people of old age live in some areas of China, in Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men living."
However, due to the lack of documents, no scientific evidence of age can be given, especially when the registries are missing.
Every day a glass of melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Lerika live to the biblical age conspicuously often.
There are currently 20 people who are over the age of 100.
So why do so many aged people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special Talyš genes.
The director of the Fatulyva Museum, on the other hand, believes it is about nutrition.
However, the fact that the caloric diet of the Talysts, who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter on a daily basis, is so healthy, is not exactly plausible from a bromatological point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, is occupied by Rubaba Mirzajeva.
At 97, she is still relatively young at this latitude.
Mirzajeva, who claims to have 143 children, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with the butterscotch he wads relentlessly.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirzajeva's sons and a daughter. They're both grandparents long ago.
There are also two young children bouncing around.
In the kitchen, the guest room is prepared for the tea, which is served in the typical "armadu" bellows.
Mirzajeva's white teeth form the perfect line, with a long, dark blond braids hidden beneath the scarf, proudly uncovered by her son.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn't look like it and kept the color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzajeva says.
Monthly retirement to live is enough
She ate only what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In all my life, I've never bought groceries at a supermarket.
Then he tells me about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But all improved when the oar was taken over by the "beloved father" Gejdar Aliyev.
The propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is made around the figure of the father of the nations who ruled his country as a dictator knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the oar.
At least the old people in Azerbaijan do not suffer from a hike.
Mirzajeva receives a pension of 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) every month. That's a sum for the circumstances here that's good to live on.
And perhaps Mirzajeva's long-grested son is also right: "Old people enjoy great respect for our culture."
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, cherished and happy.
Unless it's a reason to stay alive as long as possible

The revolution returned to Cairo.
The displaced demonstrations in Cairo revealed the country's deep ambivalence.
It is strongly debated about a future constitution based on Sharia law.
The Egyptian president spared no pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And for us to do so, I am responsible, to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was for the entire nation, but primarily to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secular people.
For all of them, still hopelessly quarrelling in the bewildered opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the "God's state" on the Nile, on the love of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily reduced the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his own to "rescuing the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds the title of doctor doctor at the U.S. University of Southern California, wants to do, the Egyptians and the world are unclear about.
Should the judiciary be stripped of power?
The 234 sections that the sturdy Constituent Assembly hastily approved by the Islamists in a 15-hour night marathon are partly aroused by concern.
As in earlier constitutions, it is said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "circulars of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, this illuminates the newly added section: In all Sharia matters, it is necessary to consult the al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
It may not, but it may mean that the clergy will supervise the legislation, which would effectively bring the judiciary the waiver of its right.
There are many things to interpret in the draft constitution
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts is to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values."
This is legally formulated in such an inaccurate which, by means of this section, state institutions could even control the content of the arts and literature.
In intelligible language, this means nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no section in writing defines the explicit equality of men and women.
But another paragraph prohibits defamation or slander of the Prophet Muhammad and his envoy.
What remains unclear, however, is what the vilification is and how it will be prosecuted.
It is equally dubious to formulate that "peeping people" is forbidden.
In this case, is a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of law experts?
The matter of interpretation, as much more in this proposal, which Morsi will submit for his signature and, in his words, will be presented "very soon" to the Egyptians for the purpose of popular vote.
"The revolution has returned"
For several weeks, the opposition has been forming against the outnumbered by the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people, in an unusual concordance, gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night and promised to destroy the constitutional charter before it began to take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdín Sabbahi, who placed third in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradeej, said the draft constitution belongs "at the dustbin of history."
Through the short-card service, Twitter accused Morsi of seeking to "coup the crackdown on democracy."
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition member Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brethren is not yet punished," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a reborn, but as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile outside the University of Cairo.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters who called out, "The people are demanding the application of the Lord's Law."
They called for Morsi: "Cut the country!" and assured, "The Coran is our constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which it all began, would probably provoke a similar civil war.
Morsi's supporters clearly did not want to take the risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution were vocal and vocal.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country is to go.
A majority is considered certain in favour of the Islamist proposal.
"The word 'human rights' is not found once'
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, is rooted in Hafiz Abu Sa'da.
The 47-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or on trial for Mubarak.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' are not even once now," he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag."
Morsi's extension of power to all three of the state's power branches forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offence against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president effectively abolished it," Sa'da complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
The Sa'da feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the struggle of the ideological factions of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could backfire on him.
The demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "You have created a monster that you can no longer control."
Norwegian raft: The most smelly fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the local appetite for the extraordinarily smelly fish?
Take some overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Just leave it for a week.
That gives you the smell of the paralyzing chunk of the cocopisk, one of the greatest Norwegian delinquents.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a magnificent view - and a pervasive odor hangs in the air.
The coffers are salted trout fermented in the water for up to one year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and getting cold, the Norwegians begin to gather here in Fagernes for a festival dedicated to this, as best to say it, the most captivating meal.
"You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called "Rakfisk general" who is responsible for the festival's progress.
All around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink them with a large amount of alcohol.
"Some people prefer to aquavit rather than raftisk," says Havard.
The drink can be overwhelmed.
I'll try a few pieces.
If a fish can avoid your nose, it's not that bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that's been on the long journey by bus.
The cancer is a product of a very different time when Norway was in poverty, and because there were no refrigerators, the fish were soaked in the autumn in the autumn into airtight barrels of water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they pulled out and ate - the senses were no doubt blunted with alcohol.
Ahead of just one generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and a large-scale care system.
The people of Sweden, an old rival who was much richer than Norway not so long ago, are pouring into the country for work.
The raffque is seen as something important, indispensable, if a rather smelling, though rather smelling, part of the Norwegian past.
It is one of the more expensive dishes on the market.
Even if it's all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £9 ($14) a piece.
Norway is often in short supply to global news - and it seems to suit most of the population.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children in the past year, is still mentioned here with reluctance.
Instead, the shooting is called "the action of 22. July."
Norwegians find it hard to believe that in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway's current wealth lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries from the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we do so well," says our waitress Anna, wearing a plate with a rigged raft, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, presents a prototype for Nordic affluity.
We are, as you say, considered people.
Her English, as is the English of most of the people here, is absolutely impeccable.
We're not getting married, we don't like pomp.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - in addition to a small percentage, most of the sector's money is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial crash was scattering the money they didn't have, the Norwegians had tightly tightened their drawers.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And eat a raffleball," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of a raffle.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else and it's beautifully juicy.
But in the evening, the smell of fish is back.
The hotel I live in is one of the many places to serve the raffle for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most demanding, of the smell.
They have a connection to a live TV broadcast in which the bowler is surrounded by cupcakes with a raffle.
It's like the Eurovision singing competition.
"What score do you have for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thore-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Havard."
There's applause and laughter.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps worn out by aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a tough start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant from the BBC is looking at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently particularly bad.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers were erected to close several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent the protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash and take over the nation's leadership.
He faces a challenging task.
Mexico did well economically at the time of the outgoing Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the clutches of the drug war, which has already fallen victim to 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce the violence," President Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he shook hands with the US president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as the governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions on the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
In the country town of Valle del Bravo, for example, they remember him in a good way.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and to building infrastructure.
You can now reach the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto had built. These highways are a huge improvement over the leaky and bumpy roads that were here before.
The boards with his name also hang on the wall of the modern sports center and the imposing interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
"We expect it to bring real and lasting change," says friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, state member for the president of the Pena Nieta, the Party of Institutionalised Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in the security and economy that our country so badly needs.
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI was pushed out by Vicent Fox.
Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, much is expected to be forthcoming from Enrique Pena Nieto within the party.
And he rejects the opposition's comments that characterize the new president as a man with no substantial content.
He is a very straightforward man, very biased with the country's excellent vision.
He is a great statesman and, above all, a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression that many people have from its former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more obvious.
It is stilted under the highway overpasses in many ways to commemorate the suburbs of the capital of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the self-governing community are also persistent and urban.
At the start of this year, the military was called in to help manage drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, particularly acute is violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in desolate places next to the vast waste dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was the governor, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murders of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pena Nieto say he failed to adequately address the problem of women's murders when he was in office.
And, worse, his leadership is blamed for closing his eyes.
In the concrete house, typical of a dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendio shows me a photograph of his late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Marian committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were stamps on him after the blows, and the posthumous stiffness had begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana stares down from the picture on the wall, next to the cross, on which is the only word: "Justice."
However, this is, as the family says, exactly what they were denied.
The state authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, and a whiter.
They want you to just accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But that can't be right for so many mistakes and omissions to make," he says.
The sheer, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been hit by a violent crime, and the new president has promised to be his priority while he was in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as the governor," says Valt del Bravo MP Olvera.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations regarding rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis of the rave treatment of Manning in prison.
The private is charged with stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of secret material in U.S. history, has missed many of the possibilities of complaining of the rough treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Military prosecutor has. Ashden Fein in the cross-examination of Private Manning at the preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, in Maryland, claimed that the weekly attendance records that Manning had with the officers of the unit's nine months of ties at Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about mistreatment.
The cross-trial interview that took place during the hearing on the defence's motion to dismiss the case against Manning on the ground of rough treatment at the time of the detention, which is in itself a sufficient punishment, took place the day after Manning testified that he had considered suicide in custody.
An Army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is charged with the theft of thousands of secret documents in his service in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, passed through the forms that officers filled out after meeting Manning at the Quantico detention centre, where he was held in a high-security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning the questions and rehearsing his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment of his guards as "excellent" and rated the total treatment in the facility as "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaints about mistreatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about how he was treated, Fein claimed.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about the various problems orally, and that the officers who had visited him had discussed these concerns with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but had not noticed these problems.
"They wrote down "no problems" (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his person's treatment in January 2011 in a meeting with a suicide panel assessing suicidal ideals he had made in the form.
Manning replied that during the course of this meeting it was his intention to achieve a reduction in the "prevention of injury" regimes.
The military said it used the restrictive regime (one level below the regime's supervision for the sake of suicide) to protect it and protect it for the safety of others.
"I wanted the guards in detention to know that I was okay and that I wanted to cancel this injury prevention regime... to enjoy the increased quality of life I saw," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and being taken to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before being transported to a detention center at the Marine Corpsac in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once passed out there for heat reasons.
He said that he had not been allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the outside world was very disheartening.
"My world has shrun down to the Arifjan base, to the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Manning said that after arriving at Quantico, he spent most of the days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, a pair of shoes, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying was against the regulations during the day.
Manning said he was always sleeping with the light from the outside of the cell's eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned the other side in the night, he was woken up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about the charges he had made in Thursday's testimony, alleging that after being forced to sleep one night in his cell at Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other fellow inmates in the morning's count.
Manning testified that he was not allowed to be allowed to cover himself with his blanket when he counted.
At a questionary conducted by Judge Manning on Friday, he said that he had decided, on the orders of his guards, that he had a blanket that he could cover up, but admitted that he had not been ordered to postpone.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he tried to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his backpacks to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Manning testified that his underwear, his underwear, his backpackers and his glasses were removed from his cell that night.
His attorney hopes that the judge will take into account his experience of imprisonment and that his sentence will be significantly reduced in the case of his convictions before the court-martial, which is expected to begin at the start of next year.
The defense said it planned to be Manning to plead guilty in lower-criminal offences and that he would fight other charges because they were too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled for the start of the hearing this week, with the military prosecutor expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said a statement that Manning was held in accordance with regulations regarding all those arrested in maximum security detention.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, the illegal inflicting of online news releases, the transmission of information relating to national security and the theft of public property or records.
If he is charged on all counts, he can be sentenced to life in prison.
My Crisis of Mexican-American Identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made my way through the crowd and arrived at the immigrant agenda area, where I ran into a problem.
The darts pointed to one of the two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Servinci").
I stood there for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's an ethnic shorthand, the same as when my friends in Boston are called "Irays" and my friends in New York refer to themselves as "Italy."
So later, I ended up with the term "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, it was not necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the interview in that language.
But I don't have a vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and queued up for "Extranjeros."
I was thinking about the moment when the newly elected Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited President Obama at the White House this week.
The program's agenda was the usual issues that were discussed when the leaders of the two countries met: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans will stay in Mexico as they travel to the United States is the same.
It wants to connect with the United States and Canada to create a trade bloc in North America similar to the European Union.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against the drug cartels, though he provided no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to rewrite half of Mexico's territory to the United States under threat of weapons.
But for Mexicans who think in the space of centuries, not minutes, the reminders are pervasive.
So a minute after a U.S. official says something just a little bit critical of Mexico, you'll hear complaints in the Mexican press and the elite about how Americans are encroaching on their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the Montezuma children will step out on the war trail.
And yet for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hostile feelings?
There are a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people the country offers options to, and others that don't.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps a parent, or a grandparent who was denied an opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person was matching the profile - dark skin, weak education, origins from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even though we now live the American dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is to the United States.
And beyond that, we are aware that many elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and view us as a menacing race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence, in their view, is only a failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they would never have left him.
And we would now find ourselves not trapped behind the silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with the lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more who they are, and the Mexican Americans resent it.
Even though she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
At the same time, many Mexican Americans I know do not feel part of either.
We love listening to Mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you don't have the roots in either.
In Mexico, he views us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make relations even more complicated, some Mexican leaders want to reconnect with the diaspora, and some of the intelligence, as I learned on my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as "social ambassadors" and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should be telling our fellow American citizens how great it is to visit this country and pressure political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
Well.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that it is a great country.
I have a feeling it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not prepared to forgive the United States for forgiving the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel resented for the way in which their family members were treated in the considerably closer past.
Hmmm.
We may be more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, the new Middle East
The end of fire between Israel and Hamas could still be an uncertain basis for peace.
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such is not happening is in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary rumors about who started it, many of the buildings were turned into a wreck, killing more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. And for the first time, rockets from Gaza fell near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order, and the Palestinians and Israelis, like it or not, are caught up in the region's chaos.
It may cause their fight to be even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this may interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, it seems that there is little reason to be optimism at the moment.
Even if the cease-fire stopped closed on 21 November, the fighting this week was bolstered by hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that they have forced the Israelis to retreat, even as Gaza has suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of the 1.7 million Gaza people in one of the most plausible and populous corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, currently run by its staunting Fatah rivals, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may very well conclude that time is on their side.
The Islamists around the Arab world have gained more influence, so Hamas has made powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, the reunited regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas. So is Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
Cheering people from Hamas say that the Islamic crescent will encircle around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah's party/military reigns, through Syria, where the rebels increasingly inclined to Islamism can depose Bashar al-Assad to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the kings.
Above all, on Israel's southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab countries, sat a balance in the region, has changed its balance.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
The Brotherhood, on the other hand, is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more impressionable public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may appear as a player who cannot be ruled out by Israel or America.
In contrast, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusions.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in a box.
Israel's Iron Dome missile system proved its worth, and many of the Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as steadfast as ever. Many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the final round of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the Gaza rockets have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, there has been relatively calm in Israel since 2004, it has been relatively quiet in Israel, some thanks to the wall that extends into the West Bank, the main parts of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and it protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their unlawfulness to international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party team teamed up with the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22 election campaign, is in a good position.
Why pampermine those treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn't they be launching missiles, as their countrymen did in Gaza?
It's better if we keep them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads out.
Perhaps the hardliners will win, but the Arab Spring may change their calculations.
While Islamists who gain power in Egypt and other countries do not like Israel very much, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
Israel's defense spending is higher than that of all of its four Arab neighbors combined.
The launch of a new war with the local superpower will hardly help new Arab governments to heal their economies.
That President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to reach the cease-fire is a good sign and can mark the start of something new.
The Israelis, too, should look at the situation in the long run.
As the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, the denial of rights is creating Palestinians' rights to self-determination of the powder keg that must one day explode in areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already at this time, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography is exacerbating this situation as the Arab population is growing.
Bloody attacks against Gaza every few years to push back Hamas will increasingly take diplomatic toll.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what the sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and the following newspapers proclaim: two states where Israel ceding territory for reasons of security.
In the short term, there is a little hope that stopping the fire will give the pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on the push of the matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must work to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state founded on the 1967 borders with the replacement of part of the country and shared by Jerusalem.
The outside Arabs must also push for a match between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than the immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty at the UN to create a Palestinian state state state sovereignty.
President Obama also has a stake on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
At his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to enter the process.
That's woefully shorthand.
America has a vital interest in the stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, laws on ugly cigarette packaging have come into force
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are marked with warnings for smokers and diseased parts of the body.
Australia's laws on ugly tobacco and cigarette packaging, the first of their kind in the world, have come into force, and the brands' logos and colours have been replaced by general olive green boxes with heinous pictures of diseased body parts and depictions of children and newborns-mouth disease-related as a result of their parents' smoking.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between the boxes between the boxes of the names of the marks, which are printed in the same small print, are required from Saturday.
This is the world's most stringent tobacco packaging regimen.
The Australian Federal Government argues that the aim is to deter young people from smoking by depriving the habit of depriving him of his appeal.
It relies on studies showing that if people don't start smoking until they're 26, there's a 99% chance of never starting to smoke.
"Even with very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell to them together with their product," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown in the logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering introducing similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies argued that this law would increase trading on the black market, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
"This legislation will make serious unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring back much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Another says the laws have increased their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for silicone cigarette packaging to cover the disgusting packs, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their appeal on the laws to the Australian Supreme Court, increased their appeal from near-zero sales.
Ha said Zico sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesale dealers and expected new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
Experts cite the popularity of social media in the demographic group targeted at the plan as a possible hitchhike.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and demanding that most retailers hide cigarettes from a direct eye, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you are a marketing officer in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, online space is an insurmountable place for you to be," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Ms Freeman noted an increase in the ratings of brands on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, conducted by the "average Honza."
We have to ask, is he just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and took the trouble to create this video, or is that a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia claims that the industry has focused on how to deal with the new regulations rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - countries within the World Trade Organization claiming that trade is unjustly restricted, despite the fact that neither country deals significantly with Australia.
The SOO decision is expected to be delivered in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are being considered by the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are resisting.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"You just pull out a cigarette and shove the pack back," says Victor El Hage, buying a box of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, there's only one reason for me to stop smoking, and that's my little daughter.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says it is harder for him to coffers to coffers.
"It took me one hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
"The government should just ban them completely, then we'd say, 'OK, that's the end, we'll close the shop'," he said, throwing up his hands.
In a world of constant connectivity, it's not so bad to be bored
I spent the last Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane was in mechanical trouble and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free stores).
But some scientists and experts in childhood development are increasingly coming up with praise for boring.
They say it's good for us (and our children) to be bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we have no chance of enjoying the boredom.
So should we encourage boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back to that.
Firstly, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively new phenomenon that occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary of Canada, who is the author of Boredom: A Lively History History) (Yale University Press, 2011) says.
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
A Latin inscription was found on the walls in Pompeii concerning boredom, dating from the first century A.D.
And then there's also the question of how we define boredom.
The trouble is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing the research literature and presenting the idea to the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was unable to do it."
Boring differs from apathy in the fact that the person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there's no urge to do anything about apathy.
He says the core of boredom is "the disinheritement of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and a sense of slowly passing time."
Boredom can be a great reminder of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see a problem like the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to the tape at which the person read the article from the magazine.
Some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group didn't hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program quietly reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but they weren't sure why and attributed these troubles to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or intriguing task, disrupting attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, "such as finding bad parts on a factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and scribbing, which is often viewed as a sign of boredom, can actually help to fight boredom and keep people physically more attentive.
"The research shows that children who are allowed to fidget will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," Professor Fenske said.
We've all experienced boredom at some point - the delay in my flight, the humming speaker, the particularly lengthy film.
But some individuals have a better chance of bored than others.
To help measure boreholes, scientists in the 1980s developed the "Stupit for Prernage to Periphery" (Boredom Proneness Scale).
The scale includes questions such as: "Many of the things I have to do is repeated and are monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do them all."
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and various external stimulations.
Teenagers, however, are generally inert.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be higher or lower now, 21 years later.
But he said he knew that "addling is the ultimate time for boredom," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question, "Is boring good for you?".
As the research shows, sometimes not, because in their extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play games of chance or abuse addictive substances as a way to alleviate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who had studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Boring is the brain's way of telling you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU.
But the brain doesn't always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you're bored and use this energy to play guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will only make you happy for a while, not in the long term.
So if your kid is bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he's not going to learn how to entertain himself or self-drive, said Professor Fenske.
And "this stand-alone procedure is transmitted from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will learn not only how to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we should not be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of the constant rattling of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of the need to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly oversimmed," he said, "it's hard to find ways to entertain yourself when the noise turns off."
There is no handbook in Colorado regarding the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student at a college and a football player from southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for something that will soon be legal throughout the state - for holding several grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September he was riding with several friends in Lamar, on the plains near the border with Kansas when he was stopped.
After the officer found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco was issued for a summons for drug possession and equipment for drug use - minor offences for which there is a $100 fine each - and a court date was set.
"They treated us like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after the Colorado vote on the legalization of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the spot rather than on the right.
Hundreds of marijuana possession offences have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped accusing adults aged 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative precinct said they would continue with existing marijuana cases, and still blame people for possession.
At the same time, several towns from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are voting to prevent the opening of new, state-revealed marijuana stores in their municipalities.
"This matter is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
The headheads are also being scratched by regulators in the state of Washington.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system for growing, producing, distributing and selling - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is first ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use and now recreational.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it's going to be a good clue," Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Board.
But, as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system could do any more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent to follow," he said.
Washington law, so-called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will not yet be a state licensing system, but a legal holding will not.
And there are messy mechanical issues that must be resolved over the course of this time, such as how to balance the state's directive on the "corresponding access" to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade within 330 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
"It will be no longer difficult to place a licensed cannabis trade in cannabis than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, recently founded research groups.
On November 21, the police chief Oates of the city of Aurora sent an email to his officers in informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute the offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for every citizen over the age of 21 and that the police would stop accusing people of blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the district of Weld, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck presents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, although many of them face further charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they took place," Mr Buck said in his statement.
The response was also complicated in places like the country district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in the Grand Junction, the district's largest city, no longer blame adults for holding a small amount.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to reject all ongoing hold cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And the conflicting reactions across the state revealed, with this great state green experiment, a deep ambivalence among local officials.
For district prosecutors, it's a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents marijuana possession defendants, and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting the people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on the best path to becoming national test cases for legalizing the drug.
Defense attorneys and state authorities are planning new limits for legalized sales, while also scrupulously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to treat and cultivate marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders for legalizing marijuana hope the Justice Department will come to the league.
Despite several arrests by marijuana vendors for medical use and patients who use it, the federal government mostly left the medical marijuana shops in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While narcotics agents are unlikely to set off the door to pick up a small bag of drugs, it is likely that they will defy the state-regulated logging shops of recreational marijuana called for by the new laws, Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on President Obama's administration's anti-drug policy.
Several of the Colorado cities are not waiting for the federal authorities to advance.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums for any new marijuana business, though it will take about a year or so to open any store.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the west of the state proposed a six-month ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a position to get a license from someone and then we get a big federal issue out of it," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the municipality voted for, as opposed to what the state voted.
There are many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I am a conservative."
For their opinions, it is not just today's university students who are being attacked.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, which I thought was the world's greatest seat of knowledge, a modern, overcooked Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, within the late 1980s, I packed my bags in the late 1980s after taking over to Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, and rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had given up because I objected to the parents' lovemaking in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson said cheerfully that I had left because I was forced to drink from battered cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran.
Yes, I escaped because I was the subject of systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of the supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask why I'm bringing this up now.
Simply because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students to the right of the center suffers from such persecution.
The institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students sought equal protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Younger Occupy Association (JCR) at Corpus Christi College claim that, because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and are shown to be welcome."
They call for a position on the University Committee on Equal Opportunities to ensure that they are free to communicate their views.
Their situation was not helped by the recently released BBC Two documentary programme entitled Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right (Fairytale Country: Young, Intelligent and Right-wing) about the student political action that polters have depicted the Conservatives as oddballs and neo-Nazis.
The show featured a graduate of Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who rode the Rolls-Royce, who wore a silver suit and wore a silver-headed club.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "senseless lambs" because of the introduction of higher tuition.
Luke Black, 20, a vice president of Nottingham University's Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "left-wing influence at universities is growing.
People believe we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
A 21-year-old history student at the Corpus, Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is "unpleasant," while OUCA's 19-year-old elected president, Stephanie Cherill, says that JCR members' approach to the right of the center has suffered deterioration.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as for the well-being of the members' living conditions," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18-year-old and cripplingly shy.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was the most severe.
A year earlier, the university had voted to refuse to award an honorary degree to former former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be shivering with fear.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students meet with each other and the professors, I got a taste of the swelling that was to come.
I found that not only do professors tinder the tail of conservative pupils, but they were also keen to participate.
The timber-panelled auditoriums were brought into the politics of the mining strike, the privatisation and resistance of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture was to translate a French text from the 18th century to English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now the deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a face like a cake dough, was very bilious.
"The Thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
Tears came into my eyes.
"I suggest that you take some basic lessons in French in your spare time, unless you are too busy with social matters," Professor Pitt growled.
I went back to my room devastated.
I sat alone at school dinner when I felt a slight tap on the shoulder.
He was a sophomore fellow named James who introduced himself as an OUCA member.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is targeted.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be labourists.
Later in the local pub, I cowardly tried to pretend.
I insisted on not agreeing with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A first-year philosophy, politics and economics student who (as ironically) went to Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students were notching with him.
I was sick, dirty.
"How do the Conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're beating each other, aren't they?
I felt the way that homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet with like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn into a Labour and curb my natural tendencies?
Three years before me developed as a purgatory of disregard and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based on my college.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of those who make speeches to her.
He was barely there.
The place hated that place for its parochiality and pettiness and for its embodiment on the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he took up a post as a professor at the Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents' house in London, seeking refuge from my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not the mood of dream in the city.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect manners.
His moist, his moist, sighs.
Try again.
I'm sure it's just a prank.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a Conservative Party supporter, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his conviction.
The following week, during the course of the lesson, when another professor of history declared in complete esteem that I was a "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing with shame inside, I confessed to "the parents were brainwashed" and called them "old fools."
Relief was only short-lived.
The nail in the coffin of my Oxford career was hammered by my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns for Murdoch's newspapers every week.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed up my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You could call me a snot-nose, snotty-faced.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be the subject of such intimidation and venom in the educational institution.
But even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 Conservative prime ministers emerged, but which, to date, also hides behind the undeserved reputation of the place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Fashion" which opened this week in London, the ABC spoke with Nata Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous Italian designer customers.
Somerset House, ancient residence of Isabella I. English, is the only place in the British capital to host the Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The designer confirmed this at the opening of the celebratory retrospective "Valentino: a master of fashion" which represents more than 130 top-of-the-line fashion models created by his studio for the past 50 years.
"I adore this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not be written without his honoured clients.
Valentino had always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which will run until 3 March, brims with private correspondence and photographs with the signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek princess Maria-Chantal and Margaret from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the city of Vogher in the north of Italy to idol of the international "Hoden elite."
To like the royal family is no bad thing.
"At least they don't put a cigarette stove on a great carpet like some gorgeous pop-music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and enjoys the guests abundantly and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased when we were invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen and a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And he's a star, too."
Valeria Mazz shows off Valentina
The charisma of the designer is not forgotten by Argentine model Valeria Mazz.
'It's been many years since we went to his house for dinner after one of the parades in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and between us were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every little thing in his apartment, his decoration, his food, the music, he showed up in everything and his spirit.
He made all the invitees feel important and loved," recalls the top model, who started working with him during the High Fashion Week in 1995.
"He will never go out of fashion because his designs are works of art," he concludes.
A parade of nobility
Gravani's life is not an obsession, but a truly reerunical love.
He loves people with good manners and better titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was converted into a seventy-meter-long passage that offers a role-benefit: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the passage to observe the "generity" of dreams worn by Valentin's masterpiece as the dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy to her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "Noci," or a coat of wool and fur that belonged to the emperor Farah Diba.
The children's maquelynenames shine with names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurna and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of the Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that Valentino's first is as first love, "it's impossible to forget about him."
"I remember it perfectly.
They were trousers, shirts, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-sima collection.
It was a gift he made for me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museies.
"I give him priority over others for his femininity and great love for women because she underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
"I really like the colors he uses, brighten up a lot and give the "pricar" to the face.
The proportions are perfect."
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget how she wore Valentino for the first time.
Growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be of age and have the chance to wear one of his evening dresses...
She eventually got to see it in the late '90s.
"I bought my first Valentin dress to mark the occasion of my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that wore a skirt with ruffles, a framed bodice, and a hangerless top.
It was a dream that became a reality," says Rodriguo's widow d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is lax to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat, whose life is between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has the designer's solemn dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it's also a set of memories that have in them."
"King" of fashion
The highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the Marie-Chantal Miller wedding dress from her wedding to Pavel Greek in 1995.
To create these silk ivory dresses with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a four-and-a-half-metre-long train, it took four months of work and 25 "incofforts" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents the milestone of the top-flight of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from high society."
Valentino, dazzled over the years by the elitist "savoir-être," is now his best example.
Garavani as the Cavaliere di Gran Croce (top decorations in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and the Order of the Honorary Legion of Honor accumulate as much honours as any of the spouses of his clients.
"My attention was always drawn to his choice, his calmness, his neat, and the perfect appearance," the princess acknowledges d'Arenberg.
"Last recently, I saw him at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
He was impeccable, time left no trace on him.'
If the princess says so...
The toughest craft in the world: sulphur porters in the Kawah Ijen volcano area
For four euros, the carriers in the Indonesian volcano region are gambling with their lives and hellos as they lay 70 kilos of sulfur down on steep stone trails.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case for Anta Wijay, one of the 400 miners who make his living by conquering sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, they have to fry every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gases are leaked from the inside of the Earth and, when in contact with the air, they pass into a solid state.
After choping up large sulfur blocks, which together weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them on the shoulders in two bamboo baskets along the steep stone trails.
To the top of the volcano, which towered 2,386 metres, it is only 250 metres, but it takes the exhausted carriers over 40 minutes to climb up the turtledist pace as they keep their balance and carefully consider their steps to avoid slipping and crash into the abyss.
They know that any stumble could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who collapsed from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
When they're up there, they make their way past the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys in the circus, and wearily carry heavy baskets to the vase that the mining company has placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1850 metres.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has benefited in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers to more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even whitening of sugar.
"Because it is normally 70 kilos worn, we earn about 46,000 rupees (€3.8) for each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and is destroyed at the end, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (€11.5) per day.
While this seems to be a negligible amount for such an inhumane effort, it is three times what he would make in the field.
"The miners' wages are very high here. For example, collecting coffee is paid for 15,000 rupees (€1.2) per day, and the salary for a fortnight is two million rupees (€166))," explains the porter who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (€6.2) per day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason, which is as convincing in Indonesia as sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, who is Hindu, and I took her to Jávu to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he's hard to breathe, he's still coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks living in the Kawah Ijen volcano three times a day, the sulfur of which has already begun to take its toll on it, even though his face is protected by a special mask and goggles.
He has asthma, he can't breathe, he's coughing all the time, and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to get his dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises more than a decent English.
This likeable and intelligent young man, troubled by his fate, could be a tourist guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, and instead does the work of a porter.
She shares a dirty wooden shack with other porters and gets up at two o'clock every day because the sulphur continues to rise at night and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glowing with darkness.
Despite the surrounding darkness, the pharates of Anto to the crater, illuminating his way with a small lantern, which he has attached to his helmet and bought it himself with his money.
About 400 porters carry a sulfur basket from the crater's bottom of the crater
Although the company has high incomes, it has not stabilized the extraction of sulfur because of cost savings, nor does it provide the carriers working on their own and with such effort, no equipment.
In fact, they do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (€2.5) from the photography supplement, which, together with a 15,000-sized ticket (€1.2.), is collected by the nature park keepers from tourists arriving to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for the cattle, and not for the people," says Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old carrier who has worked at Kawah Ijen for three decades, ever since he left the schools.
He can do a lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he can work "as long as he can" work because he needs the money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life
Although sulfur burns its throat and stings in its eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and traps the miners in the dense fumes that emanate from the volcano, the miners are so claiming that none of them complain of suffering from serious illnesses... but this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pain and wounds on the shoulders caused by the weight of the baskets.
The Unainik who balances his basket on his back can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues dig out 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which the three trucks then take the steep road between the thicket to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik declares, opening a wide mouth in which several teeth are missing.
Of his five sons, the eldest, the 30-year-old, also earns the earlift by mining.
Time passes, but the incessant misery of one of the world's most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation - the crafts performed by human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans are seduced by not having children, careers, stress, and the cost of living and education.
"The people of Singapore need to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, and you're my wife and you're a patriot. Let's fulfill our civic duty and spawn a new life!
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a hoop-bonus ad, but still - or perhaps because of it - the video in Singapore this year was expanded en masse to YouTube in Singapore.
These theorems are part of the rap used by local innuendos, which uses the "we put the buckle in the oven" as a mockery of the fertility rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency BBH, which created the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a funny way with this ad.
The agency's art director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the influence of music to make people live up to "his civic duty."
"This is strictly an Internet issue, so it must have been fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world in reproducing our population, so we felt like it was a topic we had to touch.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot of things like expanding pheromone perfumes or organizing dating parties.
Many of these ideas might have been creative, but not entirely functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative possible thing, such as the composition of the rap, to solve the problem."
1.2 children
Whoever doesn't take it too lightly is the Singaporean government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all of these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, advanced-tech urban state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The fertility rate in Singapore, with a view to stratifying the population, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the birth rate, which is considered to be the rate of renewal, in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Department of the National Population Agency says it's because of "imaginable education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"People have a wider range of options at their disposal when it comes to life's goals and priorities, it's not just a wedding and a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing the number of single people and to postponing marriages and proclamations of children. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While immigration policy included efforts to drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against a decline in the population, this has provoked resentment among the locals.
Some Singaporean websites show undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticised for maintaining low pay and making little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the governing Singapore party recorded its worst election result since the start of independence last year.
After the election, there was an effort to address the problem by using quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has seen effects on national economic growth, tax revenues, health-care spending, and immigration policies, and there have also been some unexpected consequences for Singapore.
The government is trying to keep buildings of so many small houses.
For example, it began to influence the real estate business.
The Municipal Development Office has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "footboxes" that can be built in certain urban areas.
These flats have an area of 46 square metres and have been a great success in sales.
However, there is a fear that these apartments can support the bachelor's lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the developer's EL Developers, says their "shoisboxes" sell far faster than larger homes.
"They're more popular, by selling for days to weeks faster than larger-scale houses.
That's why they're much better for our cash flow."
However, it admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously capped when they wanted to offer too many small houses in a single project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the nation's fertility rate, a conversation with the Singaporeans working in the financial district of the city centre suggests that they will not have much effect.
"People are still stressed, houses are expensive, as are education, so do many people postpone it," says the young official.
"The others have children.
But for me it is important to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20-year-old, a young man.
Both men and women mention their careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons preventing them from having children.
So however the government tries to force citizens to have children, it is the Singaporeans who have the last word on starting a family.
What is private offline is both private and online
Privacy.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, this is something of a personal nature or "the publicity of private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disturbance."
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes on the Internet matters he would certainly not have told anyone in his normal communications?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent internet users.
In four cases, the notion of privacy considered "something entirely of its own" on a personal level and a "user name and password" if it was social networks.
"My biggest secret I wouldn't have published," says 10-year-old Jorge, in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can know about them, but not the whole world," he claims.
"I put nice pictures or pictures on FB playing.
I'm also talking to my friends there.
I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't mine, or a picture that would make someone ridiculed," he says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are related.
Among them is the mother, who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
"I started a Twitter account to express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don't know if anyone can answer me, I just put them there," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends," he says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended someone to the unknown.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask networks, and admits to the latest network that he does not know 20 people on his list of friends.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them pointed him out, nor did he want him to address or phone number.
"If they urged me or required it from me, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
Jose signed up for Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
This boy is no stranger to experience with what is now called cyberbullying (cyberbullying).
"The well-known friend was blackmailed on the social networking site.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never learned who it was," he confirms.
The victim, according to Jose, did not resign from her account.
"She just activated her private mode."
Then he explains a series of steps to safely set the account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would post pictures of acquaintances in awkward or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would do it if someone bothered me or just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate in Education and Teaching, believes that in order to navigate children and adolescents correctly in social networks, they must understand that the main objective of these networks is to inform.
He states that: "The internet originated as a means of seeking information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed."
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and author of the article Digital Reagents and digital immigrants, introduced these terms to explain the phenomenon.
"Digital natives are children and young people who were born during the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, yet we are still learning ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what not to say, at an age when they are not yet mature for it."
Also, to be - as far as the surroundings are concerned - to be deliberate, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," he adds.
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is to ask questions that make them think.
"To tell them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Marrielos Porras lists some of the possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to see someone posting your picture the way you posted a friend's?
You know what other people are publishing about you?
When you tag the people in the pictures of the celebrations, did you ask these people's permission?
And one more: Do they all need to know what you're doing right now?
The next point is to make them realise that they have to behave in the internet environment the same as they do outside of it.
It's the same rules.
"You are guided by respect, morality and other principles outside the internet, and one should be the same on social networks," he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a first-grade teacher and an educational adviser, explains the need for children's parents to carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If they understand every tricky nature, they have a good basis to talk to their children about the consequences that setting up an online account can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to be shared or published," he says.
The Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind children of the traditional "not to talk to strangers" rule.
The South American Summit Ends and the Lima Declaration Has Not Disclosed
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the Speaking of the Lima Declaration, which was announced and was reportedly signed by the seven presidents present.
The eahead agency has repeatedly attempted to gain access to a document signed at the sixth meeting of Unasur's Heads of State or Government, but representatives of both the Foreign Ministry and the presidential office, who initially stipulated that they would publish the document after the summit ended, said it would be published later on the Peruvian government's website.
They also said that the content was released by Peru's President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had their access to information restricted throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video of the presidential assembly was transmitted in the press room without sound with the message " confidential session, sound transmission prevented."
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press spokespersons of some of the governments who were present, but not the Peruvian spokesperson.
The only document published during the meeting was the list of attending presidents, which prompted the resentment of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an email to the media with a "final statement" from the summit, but this is just a statement by President Humala and not an official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes, ASPA) and, even on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not released, although it was fervently required by the press.
The official ASPA website shows that the document was released last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure broadcasting for all journalists, but to completely prevent the supply of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Hauga, which is in dispute over the border between the two countries.
President of Peru Ollanta Humala and President of Chile Sebastián Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will begin hearing the dispute launched by Lima against Santiago on Monday, with a hearing of the defence of the two parties.
"We will undergo and execute a judgment that will resolve the dispute we are hearing in this international court today," President Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"The Chile was, is and will be a country respecting international law, a peaceful resolution of disputes, a convention and an international court," Piñera said, greeting President Humal with a handshake at the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that he would submit to the International Court of Justice's ruling was made public after Colombia adopted the Bogota Pact this week, in submitting to the judgments of the International Court ruling on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered the decision to be wholly flawed.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 following the dismissal of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and the end of the Lima summit shortly after noon.
The president read out the final document, informing that 16 agreements had been adopted and action had been planned for 31 projects between South American countries, with investment of $17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the member countries of the UNASUR would take "important steps towards the target of South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are extended."
He reported that actions were supported to improve "cooperation in the fight against civil uncertainty and international organised crime, to improve the availability of medicines and the cheap internet in all corners of South America, and to joint and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters."
When Europe is in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) has no winning essence, but is intended to be used to expand our productivity and to show our nations a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve transport links between the various locations in South America, especially rural and border areas... to make our countries more closely connected and form new economic links," the Peruvian president said in the reading speech.
He mentioned that five of these projects involved Peru and the transiposites of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and the other two concerned a better link with Ecuador, but did not give more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to return to the Union of South American Nations" from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to hear with respect the International Court of Justice's judgment on the maritime border dispute disputed by Bogotha.
"It is possible that I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will discuss all the solutions, none are excluded, nor the treaty with Nicaragua that would require negotiations with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilised and considerate possible form possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of the country's president, Enrique Peña Nita.
As part of the summit, EU Defence Ministers tentatively met to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on the field of defence.
UNASUR members are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guiana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently out of the question.
Peru is the interim chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which 'South America, in this case, really must be taught from Europe'.
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state-run TV, Perú, that the Europeans "kidmouth of World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically one homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create South American citizenship, which member countries support for Unasur.
"There is a need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any of the South American countries that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still back-up areas that want to bring us back to the past," he pointed out.
The Ecuadorian president has commented, among other things, that he agrees to reshuffle the Organization of American States (OAS), on the condition that the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states be reduced and those who signed the Human Rights Pact of San José will be taken into account.
"Those in the lead are never bound to do anything, and we South Americans, on the other hand, sign it all.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is funded by the United States in Washington," he said, referring to political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles by it, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
It added that at the time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange might be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be questioned on Swedish territory for an alleged sex offence, with "the Swedish legislation's own national legislation allowing for a video referendum interview that could take place from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange would suffer a deterioration in physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that she has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But he is in danger of deteriorating in his physical and mental state because he is locked in a small space with no possibility of moving in the fresh air.
That would affect everyone's health," he said.
President Correa noted that the solution to the asylum provided to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit allowing him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks have taken place with London to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use such a word in this case, but there were ongoing talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European courts, because Assange's lawyer, Balthazar Garzón, is leading a series of proceedings at various European instances," he said.
He said that "if the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it will all be over."
And if Mr Assange's Sweden interviews at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or Skype, as the legislation there is no problem allowing for it, and as has already been done in other cases, the problem will be done tomorrow."
Using this situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, Correa made it clear that he was by no means tolerating "sub-standard, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, underpeach and perverted politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail," he said.
From this perspective, he expressed his joy at the fact that neither such journalists, "neither the bankers, nor the hegemonic countries, nor the bourgeoisie, could control Ecuador', and he said that if he was re-elected, "he would continue to make changes driven the right way and in the right direction."
President Correa also supported the decision to further maintain the veto expressed by Paraguay regarding membership of the Unasur union at least until its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and committed to legality" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
In addition, the Ecuadorian president said he considered "as an "perfectly appropriate" wish for his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, in the event of a ruling by the International Court of First Instance in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome with their will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly to be overcome and be able to go forward."
He also expressed the hope of settling the maritime border dispute before the same court, Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept a judgment, no matter how hard it is."
In the context of the possibility of running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third mandate in the standings, he noted that he perceived the possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he would retire from public life.
"I personally have never been interested in much interest, but such unjust situations as socially economic poverty in Ecuador can be corrected only by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so we must accept this responsibility," he said.
"If I win, it would be my last presidential term, and then I would retire from politics.
If we lose, the same thing is for me.
I have already made my decision," he said.
Correa also mentioned a new medical treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I was just talking to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who says that President Chávez left for a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the campaign ended.
This is not a relapse in the health of the president," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state today attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of Southamans (Unasur), which was concluded by calls for greater regional integration to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are the result of a late diagnosis today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his test was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was as if I had been struck by lightning," he says, recalling the moment of truth, which the doctor tried to "slighten" a little, but apparently without success.
The boy kept it from his family.
He decided to take his own illness on his shoulders and began to inform himself. And that's with such dedication that he's already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the most solemn patients of the HIV Unit at the Civilian Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubt, few treatment options and a greater stigma.
At the time, even the director of the Clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him "because he had a cut."
Back then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live.
However, there are a lot of people who are unaware of their disease and only come when the virus has caused the destruction of the organism and has emptied the immune system, and then becomes victims of accidental infections.
31 years since AIDS, or at least from the first documented cases, "it has been a great success for the patient's life expectancy, which will begin treatment in a timely and appropriate manner, is exactly the same as for healthy people," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, Head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Center in Guadalajara, noting that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
HIV/AIDS adden research and specialist Andrade Villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008 AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of disability of the immune system of patients diagnosed with the disease, better off being those who do not use drugs: people with 200 CD4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 CD4 cells to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that the person who is diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 can, according to these findings, "to live without problems until the age of 75 when following treatment," the doctor explained in the interview.
To highlight this progress, it is worth remembering that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UN-UN Joint Programbook for HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since AIDS was discovered, according to national statistics.
255 people died in the state of Jalisco alone in 2011 and so far by this May 187. However, since 2005, universal access to anti-retroviricics has been ensured.
- Why do people continue to die from the disease?
- "It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibility of access to treatment.
That's how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not exhausted the supply of pharmaceuticals. The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they don't know the condition of the disease, or in the late stages of the disease."
Adds a convincing label: "Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection already emerges. The only thing that needs to be done to be able to make more impact on the overall mortality rate is to diagnose the disease earlier, so we need to offer large-scale tests to detect the disease to all those who ask for it."
In his proposal, he agrees specialists and officials from the StateAIDS Prevention Board in the state of Jalisco, as well as with patients like Fabrizio, who came to have tests done at the private lab just because his friend did it, and despite his low age, he had already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the usual complications.
"Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather go three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
Change was for the better, healthy with it, I exercise, I take medication."
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
"I live a normal life like everyone's.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I take care of myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who has accepted the call to share his experience with the daily MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony as part of World AIDS Day today.
"Let them have the tests done. If they've taken a risk, let them know as soon as possible, if they're HIV-positive, it's better. And if they've been diagnosed yet, whoever they realize they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message of his summarizes the slogan of the Battle of AIDS this year.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programmes and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a guadalajar journalist who is researching information about the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "it has actually increased the delivery of condoms, we were given one or two, today they give us packages and 100 condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most susceptible to new outbreaks are adolescents.
"What do you want for?" is the common question of irony and judging from social workers, school consultants, pharmacy staffers and medical staff who do to avoid teenagers, says the reporter.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution. Let condoms not just be behind the counters, but let the hundred be in the dispensers in the public toilets, in places where the young often go.
"It's not promiscuity support.
Nor is it about "paying for beer and a motel" to them, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
There's no suchsexuality. It is best to make condoms available to those who already lead sex life," he noted.
Key Numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This state of affairs means fourth place in new and identified cases of AIDS and 13th place in relation to HIV in Mexico.
92% of the infections are sexual, 6% blood route y 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people on one registered case who are unaware of the disease.
The judgment approved by the U.S. appeals court, which does not recognise the restructuring of Grupo Vitro's debt set by the bankruptcy in Mexico, sets an unfortunate precedent for any national enterprise with branches in the neighbouring country and solvency problems.
So it seems that the restructuring procedures of firms that are allowed by Mexican law do not apply in the country of stripes and stars, despite international agreements.
Approval of the judgment delivered 15. In June last year, Judge Harlin Hale, in the bankruptcy court for North Texas, he leaves Mexican companies in practice without defending against the possibility of confiscating their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door to the U.S. Supreme Court of Mettest of the glass to the head of the Metallus Court, appealing to three irregularities.
As a preliminary point, it should be noted that while the judge of this case claims that creditors are to be governed by the U.S. Insolvency Act, the Fifth District Court of the New Orleans, based on the New Orleans, says the main action is to be established by bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
First, this would point to the lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, a United Nations model law for the unification of international commercial law was created to this end, which the arbiter determines the American Law Institute.
Second, the judgment states that without a vote of branches from the internal company structure, where Vitro's debt to branches is recognised, the required majority would not be reached for approval of the restructuring.
However, this possibility is accepted by Mexican law.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, for which the Federal RBDP was guaranteed.
In addition, it is true that even after the members' votes are subtracted, the creditors - who were against Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. "supouts" such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach the majority.
They would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This figure is disregardless by the Court of Appeal.
From another point of view, the court accuses Vitro of the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that struck the United States.
Meanwhile, the family firm Gonzáleze Sady will file an appeal for reconsideration directly before the Court of Appeal to have the assessment taken place in full attendance, i.e. with the participation of the five judges, because they had initially voted only three.
If he fails here, he will demand a revision of the higher-level process as an appeal, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
What is serious about the case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican Government as an amicus curiae unit, in which Vitro's approach under the Bankruptcy Act is detailed, in which it is pointed out that the company has made it easier for itself to move towards the agreements signed by the two countries, to confront the law with Chapter 15 of the Insolvency Act of the United States.
In addition, it points out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, the rules for international insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors alike.
impact on both sides: a punishment for both Vitro and the state.
Overall rating
Unnoticed, the Mexican Aviation union's criminal complaint lay on the table for months against the former owner of Gastón Azcárrog, which had been accused of fraudulent conduct, and the vessel had already overflowed, according to the pilots' union.
The institute, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities Commission, which he accuses of obstruction of justice.
According to her, the Audit Office of the Audit Office systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of the transaction made by that entrepreneur, in which it selected 198 million pesos from Fideikomis F/589 from the Fideikomis of F/589 on behalf of the Mexican Aviation.
The funds were most likely directed to purchase shares in the Professional Hotel Management (Administration of the Professionalional de Hoteles).
As is well known, Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Sieging Dragon Marta
The Universidad de Caribe site brought together over the weekend a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens who approved the creation of the association to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Marta in Kankún.
We are speaking, as we know, a huge commercial and distribution centre with "country-to-country with a large wall" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential area for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Earlier, the Canacintra (Cámara Nacational de la Industria de Transformación) was able to unify the governors of the southeastern zone to oppose a monumental compound that would partly devastate protected areas and which originate in all resistance to industry.
End of the matter with the ACTA
The Senate's request, which was disregard for the government, which sought clarification of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador signed the Trade Against Counterfeiting Agreement in Japan, known as ACTA, was lost in topicality, according to the Mexican Embituto's Industrial Property Institute (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial).
As is well known, this was despite the fact that the Board itself ruled out the possibility of treating it as a threat to the freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Bassbal was my life"
The basketball world-traveller Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this hall sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the world through it.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was ahead of his pelt stroke in the 2008 round-chairs, passionate about the sport for over the age of 60, whether as a player in the younger categories, a BSN national basketball league player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayamón team in the National Basketball League, or the president of the Puerto Rico Basketball Federation.
"I have held a lot of roles in basketball during my life, including several simultaneous times, as when I was president of the national league of the BSN, general manager of the national team and the chairman of the federation," Reyes recalled during a visit to Primera Hora newspaper reporters at his home in Bayamon, home with Isabel, for more than 50 years with Isabel.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating in his claim.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and souvenirs from his long career, testify to that.
Bayamón in the heart
With the greatest emotion of all, it guards those that commemorate his time at the Vaqueros draw from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as co-owner or team owner.
"That was my best years, which I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to take part in eight championships with the team los Vaqueros since 1967, whether as owner, co-owner, or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I parted with one of the championships - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy made his debut at BSN.
At that time, the team was taken over by "Cuco" Ortiz, who was an excellent leader," said Reyes.
"I remember that Gene Bartow, who was previously a coaching assistant here and was at the Alabama University in Birmingham at the time, said to me, "I have a strapping, 6-foot-2 player.
You want it?"
And that was the start of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico had ever had.
Bartow then recommended quarterback Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember he said that if Mincy brought Bayamon victory in the championship, he would then contribute to the next one.
He enjoyed the championship, when the Vaqueros hockey team played by Gausse, but only at a distance because he was already serving as president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to devote himself to his functions and enjoy Mincy's positioning in the national team.
"I remember the first time we beat the United States in the qualifiers of the Olympic Cup in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Championships in 1990, where we finished fourth, but we should have had the bronze not if it wasn't for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw-in," Reyes said.
Is the team from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as is the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the national team in the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we beat the United States team that was pretty similar to the one that blew our bronze at the World Championships.
It was the team that had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculina" (Ortiz), but also there were youngsters (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be on the team in 1990 due to knee injuries.
The team, which may not have had a perfect composition but managed to win us a gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players out of the question because of the scuffle in the Pan-American Mar de Plata, we won the gold despite all the forecasts.
What was the best player for Puerto Rico?
That was, without any doubt, Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
None of Puerto Rico had achieved such results at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his time in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I like the work of Leo Arill very much.
Which success do you consider the greatest success in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN national league had to the national league in one season to 17 teams.
What'd you get to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce as a division of youth categories by region.
For example, the Ponce guys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national playoffs.
Now the kids travel a lot and play too many matches, which is not necessary.
I also see the benefits in the compulsory certificates and courses for coaches, the assistants of the referees and the referees.
I'm glad.
What are you doing now?
I listen most of the music, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball games.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world-famous for John Ross Ewing, best known as "J.R." in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a man who acted recklessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the ferocious oil tycoon J.R. Ewing, in the television series Dallas, became a symbol of the lactuc in the 1980s, and died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new series of Dallas, died on Friday afternoon for complications associated with cancer-related complications, according to the family's official announcement, by the family's official announcement, by the collection of cancer-related events.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked best," his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who was a representative of his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in Dallas Hospital," her agent, Jeffrey Lane, reported.
He brought joy to all those he knew.
"He was creative, generous, entertaining, kind, kind and talented, and I'd be terribly fond of him.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest," Linda Gray said in the announcement.
The Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found on his liver and Hagman underwent a transplant.
The years before the Dallas airing, Hagman made himself famous on television as a decent guy in the lightweight comedy I Dream of Jeannie aired by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, the astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (jie), played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also the protagonist in two comedies that were broadcast only briefly, namely The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His appearances in the films included roles that were well received by the critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was Hangman's masterpiece in the form of the incredibly repulsive J.R., who took him to the starling peak.
The CBS drama series on the Ewings clan and other personalities aired around them from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who shot Djicare?" who was supposed to raise expectations about a work of emotion, when Hangman's character is almost murdered, has caused not only a tremendous array of speculation from viewers around the world, but also the risk to millions of dollars in the Mote offices.
This also helped this feature to reach the ratings record.
The November episode of 1980, in which the response was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers. Dallas thus became the second most-watched entertainment programme in history after the end of the 1987 series MASH broadcasts, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot at by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, who then threatened to call her a prostitute if she didn't leave town. But there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an greedy greedy-monger with a charismatic smile: a wacky businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to get his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), who was an alcoholic, to be locked up in rehab.
"I know what I want J.R.'s got on the tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be: "Here lies the honorary citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out.
Victoria Principal, who played in the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for the world's millions of admirers and in the hearts of all of us who have been so lucky to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series aired on TNT a few months ago with great success.
"The shooting of the second series of the second series has already been completed and the sixth one was just being filmed," the television station reported.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement available from Warner or TNT about how the series would proceed.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classic works such as the South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry in 1931, whose father was her husband, the lawyer Ben Hagman.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck at the theatrical scenes in New York and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published the autobiographical book Hello Darlin's Tall (The Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put in anything I knew that could hurt someone or damage them in any way," he told the Prensa Associado news agency at the time.
After a liver transplant, he turned to promoting organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to help timid patients.
"I advise them to encourage me to meet with them when they go into surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I try to give them a comfort in the sense of 'don't worry, it'll be a bit awkward for a while, but you'll be healthy'.
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
The course begins, examining the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When the professor of religion, Stuart Charmé, decided to make a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which is due to come on December 21, many people took hold as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
But Charmé had no idea what was coming for him in the next few months: Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget gap that some call "debt Armageddon," and the growing conflict into which Israel is drawn, a place in which, according to Christians theorizing of the End of the World, the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptical semester he's ever been," Charmé told students at the Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
When one discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days to go, it is a really good time.
And remember, the bad means good for the apocalyptic-minded.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, the assistant professor at Temple is hosting a "Finance, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We discuss why these ideas are spreading with time," he says, and as they offer hypothetical scenarios that control certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students are analyzing films with apocalyptic themes and examining how they differ from real life examples.
"I tried to inform students of what is possible, likely, believable and impossible," says Vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Latin history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of arts and anthropology, came together to organize a course with the simple title The End of the World.
"We don't connect "2012" because we always count on the possibility of organizing a course again if the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the "mismination of imminentment," students must study, create projects and take the final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, which gives students no choice but to work "until the end of the world's expected end," Restall said.
The courses have become quite popular.
"He started in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-anchom students, who were signed up to 35.
Weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails asking if there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student at the University of Rutgers at Camden, said at the University of Rutgers and Sociology at the University of Camden, New Jersey.
And so, apocalyptic, worldly, or religious sentiments is just a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in psychology and nursing, said he'd seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which to teach," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no interviewed student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prediction and we will refute it in some way," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University of West Chester.
"The Mayans have never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries, which people respond to changes in their surroundings with predictions of the end of the world.
The flow of these speculations was caused by the internet.
"Otherwise, people don't think about it," he said.
This is the vast majority in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who lectures in the Philippines this year, when asked if he knew about any "end of the world" course there, he answered quickly.
"The Philipans are not at the end of the world," he wrote, indicating an exemption from the highest office.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Realt noted that there had been talk of many days of the last trial over the years, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people will begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 was the start of a seven-year period at the end of which the world would die down.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors alike.
Several said they intended to go to the "end of the world" festivities.
"I guess I'll call some of my friends to laugh together," explained Twenty-year-old communications student Samira Ford.
