Inflation in Europe jumped for food
Accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is due to a steady rise in food prices in the foreigner.
November price growth in the 13 euro area countries was above expectations, with annual inflation of 3.1 percent registered after 2.6 percent in October, the Luxembourg-based EU Statistical Office reported.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the base interest rate with a reduction, along with the cognitive prices of raw materials and falling unemployment, leading to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below 2%, in the vicinity of them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it must iprad inflation úconfirms so that it does not have to do anything on the matter later.
In Germany, November's 3.3-per-center inflation is a 15-year record; in Germany, it rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent in isengro.
Inflation in the eurozone has turned up because of soaring food and energy prices.
The term prices of the aftermath were up 88 per cent, and soyone was the highest in value since 1973.
Similarly, it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products in 2007.
The price of oil on world markets has risen 52 percent this year, and last month it cost one barrel of black gold totaled nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent this year to 2.5, with the one in 2009 down to 1.9.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will remain to be around 3 per cent, with the average annual rate of 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement has grown significantly since the late stagnation as of early December, and so it now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists the Gallup Institute has never measured so low  13 percent support.
In the case of certain voters of the party, the difference  would be more than two-thirds support for the opposition's - a greater majority of the opposition's determination, compared to the MSZP's fifth support.
The MDF and the SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament, according to the survey: their support for the entire population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has deteriorated even given the previous low  the ratio of those who cope with the country's economic situation as very poor, so high  41 percent, while the situation is 46 percent, according to the other 46 percent, the situation is rather in the best.
Families are evaluating the change in their material situation after the spring and summer's hopefuls of the outlook now more pessimistic.
As for the end of the year, more of the population counts with a further deterioration and only a tenth of it with improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of respondents judged the most of the Gallup Institute's surveys so far, the prime minister's job is sleeping poorly well.
Ferenc Gyurcsány is believed or is very much believed by 13 percent, while for Viktor Orbán, the proportion of supporters is 38 per cent.
The PM is not trusted by 54 percent, the chairman of the Fidesz movement 27 percent.
One indicator of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister is to be able to be addressed without changing the government.
While after last October's unrest, the government's tenure and the prime minister were elevating at a whopping 35 percent, the share is now only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) the call only in the call for new elections.
It is significant in favour of the interest in the referendum that 60 per cent of respondents responded to a question about their eventual participation, which would certainly come to the referendum and another 20 per cent say that it would probably come.
By way of comparison, the parliamentary elections this Sunday, only 55 per cent would certainly participate, and another 15 per cent are agreeing to participate as likely. The success of the referendum would be unmistakable on the basis of the intentions of the present.
morewell, he would say no to 74, doctor's fees of 79 and hospital fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people surely promising their participation, then the introduction of the peddling, doctor's fees and hospital fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 per cent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth undercut by Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budapest Trade Triangle maintained last year's 16 percent rise in the price level with the difference this year, not one to raise VAT this year.
The article of the Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas consumer knah of Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs trade triangle grew by an average of 16 percent this year, with the bulk of all hypermarkets showing a price of over a thousand forints.
Jeliko's prices in food supermarkets vylétlétlétlét along it at the same time last December, the percentage did not show up due to the previous high base and a drastic increase.
It is certainly bleak to consumers, that what they could easily buy last year at a price of under nine thousand forints, they will not do now for ten thousand.
Consuming Monk of the Daily Economy in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The most expensive price for the buckie was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumption kna was 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and the savage fish remained almost at last year's level, with the floppy breasts, nuts and poppy seed very much.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram bread for 139 forints.
Competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of the two-litre Coca Cola in the refundable bottle was under 200 forints, so even with the backup the product cost only 257 forints.
Even so, this year, according to the consumption-based skis, the Napi Gazdaság Auchan appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to their calculations, the prices figure in the consumption cuter of Napi Gazdaság, given the prices at Christmas, were up by 15 Cora by 15 compared to prices last Christmas, while both Tesco and Auchan were up in the approximate 18 percent.
When comparing last year's highest, and this year's lowest, the average for the consumption skier was the difference of 12 percent, while the rise was the highest among last year's lowest and this year's highest.
In the forintech, the gain averaged 1,480.
The average price increase last year was worth 1,206 forints, with prices being affected by the VAT rises last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted the trade, the department stores evidently failed to decide how big the price range they should establish for individual products, they were unable to predict what effect the change in prices would have to have on consumption.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of the product in question, it is for a significant profit to lose its significant profit due to a price range adapted to the inlay of the cycle.)
Because of VAT last year, the rise in the price of the consumer kojester of Napi Gazdaság was so extreme, that the price of the most preje was 1,720 forints not before 2006, while the cheapest price difference was 844 forints.
This year the extreme difference did not show up, the most expensive one the knah now costing 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest topping by 1,234 forints.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, he revealed a disastrous rise in prices, in less than 20 months the merge of daily consumption in hypermarkets was underwritten by more than 30 percent.
(This is not entirely confirmed, among other things, by the Central Statistical Office's data: it measured a price increase for a few basic foodstuffs, which, in the case of several basic foodstuffs, prices that increase at 30 per cent over 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, according to the consumer koíe, the Daily Economy seems almost impossible, or the price level of the product, rather expensive last year, showed price growth of barely above 10 percent, given the base even in the worst case.
The flour suppliers occupy their position according to their strong strong position, with the egg suppliers, the drastic increase in prices they have also managed to promote it in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the trade gold triangle are not taking a while, still reporting on a good year.
According to their testimonies, more than one of the most customers in the three-watched stores are not interested in the prices.
They buy quantum of yarns, taking durable food by their salaries.
On Wednesday morning, in all three supermarkets, long queues at the cash registers were forming, or the number of female visitors soared.
As we know, the turnaround is the turnaround in the countryside, a number of international chains to research firms that make research firms lagging behind even their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, they are eaten on disinfectants
This year, more than 1,000 cases of infection were registered in hospitals earlier because of inappropriate antibiotic-feiting.
The sanitary conditions of hospitals, the overcrowding of the logs, the overload of staff not helped by stopping the disease, says the head of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, they also grow on disinfectants.
Recently, the trauma department of St. John's Hospital was diagnosed with an MRSA infection.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were discovered in a man who came to the hospital after a high-level traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site earlier in the year.
The patient injured in a high car accident was outdone home, he had to return with an infection of the MRSA innocence not long after, and due to the bacterium located in his body, one important surgery could not yet be performed either.
By this year's 10th December, 1,094 hospital infections caused by the multi-determined agents of the disease have been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, the head of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-determined disease agents have been registered with security in hospitals, the others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA, or methiciline-oxacillin, resistant to the golden staphylococcal.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is worn by a third of the people in their noses anyway, or cause the disease.
Infections caused by the SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and are well treated.
If, in addition, antibiotics are administered to an exaggerated degree or inappropriately, the bacterium well responding to the antibiotics develops into bacteria, where it is very resistant to antibiotics and which quickly touches in inadequate hospital conditions.
Previewed, in the event of the transiently or permanently poor functioning of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, a low body weight or in patients in years, to cause serious hospital infections, such as an early infection or blood poisoning  sepsis.
According to the head doctor of St. John Hospital, there is nothing special about the infection of MRSA, a similar infection is a daily practice in hospitals.
Infence must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there,] Tibor Nyulasi said, where the presence of the disease agent is not examined. CHora.
Resists antibiotics
We isolate these patients, the grocerial staff shimmering them in rubber gloves and masked, and we have the necessary antibiotics to be treated, admitted to Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first asked whether they are present in their MRSA organism, nor can the infection be avoided in addition.
Sampling is not in móhem
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be to be able to prevent, the current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not favourable for the prevention and insistence of multi-determined disease-environmental agents, says Karolina Böröcz.
Jelikožň, this infection is characteristically found in hospitals and homes for the elderly, hospitals should inspect the admitted patients and insulate the MRSA carriers in an instant.
The collection of microbiological samples by oval in Hungarian hospitals is not in vogue.
This is also the part of the fact that the National Health Inuviator Fund does not fund these outlets.
Most cases are thus detected if the patient suffers from a permeable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for appropriate antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, medical records.
It is necessary to strive for antibiotic therapy to be targeted, or microbiological pretense should be carried out, to avoid resistance to medicines, and to the hospital in all cases not to deliver.
The samples of microbiological samples are rare for basic or outpatient intake of patients, respectively, according to Karolina Böröcz.
etiz with disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, the MRSA is the most likely to be among the patients through medical staff.
That is why it plays a very important role as washing hands and the use of gloves and a mask, with the frequent and in this there are serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and by touch, and in the conditions of domestic hospitals it is not in the possible isolating of infected patients.
The rooms, on the other hand, are often overcrowded, losers are often very close together, perhaps from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, we could also encounter the fact that in hospitals, which are in an unfavourable material situation, they are seeing disinfectants, there are few and patients a lot of patients who are getting used to the occurrence of the infectiousness.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are being complied with are provided, similar infections are shown to be less likely, or the longer perimeter of the cause of the disease can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
The healing of the MRSA infection poses a huge expense for health insurance companies, so it is fought against all of the time.
In England, for example, the government has drafted a programme to prevent MRSA and to reduce its occurrence, respectively.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the published data, with MRSA infections in England showing a downward trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant disease agents (which also includes MRSA), or hospital infections caused by these agents of the disease, among their priorities.
The police captain, only to cause a fatal accident, not drunk
The official expert report in the case of the Police Captain XXII of the District, only caused the fatal accident, is complete.
It may be excluded that the police captain of the XXII. district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who had since resigned from his post, would have been driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, the spokesman for the General Prosecutor's Office of the capital, Attila Morvai, informed the High Prosecutor's Office of the capital on Friday after the expert report of the case was completed.
The expert's report confirmed the result of the initial embattling, which it found to be that the former police captain had not previously, had not been behind the wheel, had not consumed any alcohol.
At the time, the director of the Police Headquarters of the XXII. district hit Lajos Kossutha Street in the XXII district with his own passenger car while turning the 55-year-old man in front of him while crossing the roadway outside the designated crossing.
(The latter fact that a pedestrian was crossing off the zebra, according to the road rules, is not a mitigating circumstance, a turning car must still prefer.)
After being taken to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Because of these events, the district police director resigned from his post and was in the process of being reinstated, according to the police memo, so that he was so shaken by the case.
The matter is being carried out by the presidency of the Budapest Preschory.
Attila Morvai mentioned the fact that the former police captain had since the beginning cooperated with the prosecutors performing the preschays.
Another 400 million euros for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks worth a total of €400 million to support the university, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed on Friday in Budapest by Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a framework of EUR 300 million for Hungarian budget financing of transport projects and a more civil environment, carried out from the support of the Cohena Fund, a framework worth €300 million, while the parties had previously concluded a loan agreement for the sum of 100 million, the contract now signed concerns the application of the remaining €200 million.
Thus, the budgetary financing of the projects related to the course of the aggregate is the loan agreement of EUR 150 million.
The EIB approved a total of €300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the use of the remaining €150 million to be able to come later, with the split of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a €50 million contract that would use the budget for the previous day for the University of Debrecen's research-development project.
The meeting was also mentioned about the 4th metro line.
The parties agreed that, after Hungary has agreed to the EU with the EU, the details of the funding for the metro will be returned to whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
This, according to János Veres, can happen in the first quarter of 2008.
The EIB has funded a total of €3.3 billion of €8.4 billion in Hungary since 1990.
The interest in loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year wait-and-see and no commitment commission is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian property market is astonishing  Europe's attention is turning to the previously slightly neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is buying at the still cheapest, the fast-granging EU market in the ascending, is growing?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European destination for property purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap skiing apartments and houses on the seaside.
Of the mountains, the most in the course are the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitoéa, on the sea coast of Albena, the Golden Sands, the Sunshine Coast, the ancient towns of Sozobol and Nesebar, and the ow more and more people are also looking for properties around the Cavarna and Balchak.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, the interest of investors and the central part of the country  for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna  and more and more interested people are also buying in the vicinity of the cheap city of Ruse.
The capital, Sofia, is also a promise of tempting abrupt abuses, with business and office space promising the most viable return.
Bulgaria is on the best path to turn into one of Europe's most attractive golf paradises, becoming a sought-after destination for travel in the next two seasons alongside the summer and winter seasons.
Predicting investors thus buy it in a large way, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, property buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their own life and a virtual style.
Most customers come from England, with alias also coming from France, Belgium,  Spain and, increasingly, Romania.
There are also Malttest and Cylinders, while the Black Sea and in the ski paradise are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers are to be divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director at Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settling people are buying either renovated properties worth €50-100,000 or dilapidated old houses for €5-$5,5,000, which they then renovate.
They are deferred to good accessibility and the ease of communication, it is the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is the buyers of the chat (Bulgaria ranked among the first 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium or long term.
The increase in real estate in the capital is uninterrupted, or demand is increasingly strong.
While the highest number of real estate prices in the European Union are in Bulgaria, they have grown by 21 percent annually in the last five years.
The list of house prices is significantly pre-priced in pay rises.
Fodor and Hungarian-than-six percent
According to the Minister's information, the environment and water economy, Gábor Fodor, will be concluded with a meeting of experts on Tuesday and the international conference on climate change after the official opening on Wednesday will continue with ministers' discussions after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Roadmap from Bali, seeking the follow-up to the period of emissions-defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, they are undergoing a fierce debate between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it now does not wish to discuss the exact figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 given the 1990 level.
Another major issue in the conference is whether, in addition to reducing emissions, advanced countries will also accept both material and technological assistance from the countries reliant on it.
The agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, set by the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by a 16-member management board, most importantly under the World Programme for the Protection of the Wives Environment (GEF) to the United Nations  we may read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian more than one percent
Minister of the Environment and Water Management Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, irrespective of the success of the adoption of the Colmo-Ercoshod after 2012, and is ready to commit to a 30 percent reduction in the event that other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, will be willing to accept responsibilities and commitments appropriate to their powers.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 set a target of a reduction of 5.2 percent, with the five-per-cent commitment of 15 EU member states to be responsible for 8 percent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, what our own will deliver.  is recalled in the Ministry's press release of the civil environment.
There is a lot going on in Bali, or within two years, an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy is to be adopted, or its entry would have moved up with certainty, and for 2012. In such a case, the commitments to the reduction set by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new system of emissions-reducing, and the UN International Science Organization's climate change-wears that also pointed to its necessity in its latest report with the UN-dollar-reforming  IPCC, just after being the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would lead to a time-consuming emissions reduction and an inevitable increase in average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
British military units are publishing video-sharing video recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves with them.
First, YouTube has been embraced by the British Air Force (RAF): Special Forces operating in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera mounted on the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force Command to control combat operations in the Kandahar area and then be sent further to London, where they are broadcast on the internet.
Political message is inevitable
This form of the internet received 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers and their kanálaviš were watched by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 as defenceheadquartersamedenameddedquartersamedhommated and publishes recordings of events in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British State Department (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The air forces have released the videos according to their original intention to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they are also good to meet the orphaned public with the actual target of the army's presence abroad.
The promotion published in this form compared to traditional television recruitment adverts costs almost nothing, Defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, butts, necessarily also bear a certain political message, or in a particular form, the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made the game
The army is worried that in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, are also receiving amateur videos, capturing, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in a slightly hypocritical, ofic-ccupier-ccupier-ccupieromic promotional film, the officers are talking about at most about the loss, the bloody form of the fight is not performed by the eyes.
Indeed, it has received many videos of the fight in Iraq and Afghanistan, which arose in the sharp use, the British military has come to them with the sheep, and now.
Americans recruit a little differently  using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to do the job and in it the player can get straight into the skin of the soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
The ministries will have Christmas with raffles and pagnky
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperth does not seem to be sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she holds a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to 2007 with pogs and coffee.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with the music, in others it will conjure up the Christmas atmosphere to the officials with a raffle and a toast.
The party, the Christmas atmosphere, the concerts and the Swedish table  are so entertained by the powerful.
The state authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year will be held by the Ministry of Defence, which is not expecting its staff to do so.
At Christmas of orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, the family's associates of the soldiers at the Mission, serving currently on foreign missions, but also organize a reception for journalists.
The resort is dedicated to the atmosphere of the year at 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will kick off against other ministries.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jövő Háza, for a total of 4,320 000 forints and an estimated three hundred and fifty guests are expected to receive a total of six hundred hundred from the ministry's staff.
The resort will be honk with Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and there will also be a raffle of the draw.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday at the State Justice Council (OIT) building  the program featured concerts and dinners.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred invitees.
It seems that one NFÜ department is invited to our next Christmas celebration: the company will hold the tender process, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) with EU money.
To this end, they leased the Vígszínház Theatre building.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information, we were not able to reach the appropriate person.
Suit not needed
The OIT building was not only hosted by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the Christmas Day on December 7 with the Christmas Ball. Lucie.
From him, OIT did not want money from him to use her halls.
The ball was attended by five hundred people.
The party began with the minister's greeting, and after dinner it was possible to dance to the accompaniment of the music.
According to the answer to the [origo] portal's question at the ball, the formal indoor evening's or suits were not at all.
The Puritan Party is being prepared by the health, work and local governments departments.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a program and a celebration for staff for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Employment Minister Mónika Lamperthová will not even officially invite coworkers to the Christmas party, no longer a final working meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are expected to be given only coffee and pagáčeks, according to the press release, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
The Minister for the Local Government, Gordon Bajnai, will make a slow toast with his co-workers in the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas reunion, at which it expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party, he dedicates 2,500 forints to the guest  the total amount includes the reception with the Swedish tables and a toast.
Ever since he's Secretary, János Veres, PM's staff has been celebrating Christmas in a similar fashion for a year.
The atmosphere of the party will be absent, with official official intensifying not only the ministerial address, but also the afternoon time of the event.
The Agriculture Ministry is hosting a New Year's reception on 20 January, with the ministerial Christmas not taking place.
The reception will take place at Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Municipal Orchards and, according to the ministry's memo, there are 1,000 foruers for 100 guests.
According to the press office, this will be a very simple reception, to which only the local foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These many-year-old receptions begin with the Minister's brief greeting and end in a small-scale greeting.
The State Department and the Ministry of Schools and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the [origo] portal is renowned for the press department.
They could not disclose the price of the resort's Christmas celebrations of the residential environment in the press office.
In the case of many, four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Applied Arts.
He's meeting a giant strike
The collating of the trade unions of the League, or the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOSZ), will set up its strike commission to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike on Friday.
There is a protest public rally on Saturday, on Monday  the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act – work will be stopped.
The event will certainly cause serious interruptions to transport, because the airport's transport will almost stop completely and the Budapest Transport Company's employees (BKV) will also strike on strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, they will present the League together with the National Union of Workers' Councils, with details of the jointly organised Monday strike.
There will also be a strike commission of the LIGA  MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's action.
There is a public protest rally on Saturday, and from Monday, unions joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if there is no agreement with the government.
That is, the deadline for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act, has not been set.
Should Parliament ultimately not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions would withdraw the call for a strike in an instant.
If, in particular, the legislation is voted down, the strike commissions will come together and decide on the next steps.
According to Parliament's agenda on Monday's meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be put to the vote in the late evening or night.
Because of the start-up strike on Monday, it is possible to count on binding traffic interruptions: on the railway, the work will be halted for an indefinite period, in the morning a part of Budapest's public transport can be stopped, and more than half of the companies called.
At the same time, half the lane will also be closed in many parts of the country.
The call for the strike was joined by numerous unions and civic organisations, their listing is constantly updated on the website of the association of the League.
Some organizations announced a strike for an indefinite period, while others announced a temporary halt to the work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the Independent Trade Union of Workers of the Railt (VDSZSZ) have been unable to agree on sufficient services, yet more and more people are travelling on the start of the Christmas holidays.
According to the current communications, from the start of the operation to 13 o'clock, from the start of the operation to 13:00 will be taken at the BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, the four-hour strike will be held by the LIGA Trade Union of Works, with the Education Union and the Democratic Education Union of Educators calling for a two- and 2-8-hour job stoppage.
The Union of Hungarian Physicians will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Health Workers' and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ), which belongs to the Trade Union Co-operation Forum (SZEF), is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The most attractive of the four deferrints formulated by the League is for the government to withdraw the health aid reform proposal and to impresent a new concept for public debate.
The second-to-be is to make the new way of counting pensioners valid from the coming year to be phased in.
The third, in order to ensure that early retirement for the relevant occupational fields, the may of inclusion in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the event is that the Independent Trade Union of Workers' Workers (VDSZSZSZSZ), under the trade union pool of the League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the relegation branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard to raise country's risk
The work of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division) of the Institute of Political Capital, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole area in several respects.
In wareness of the risks to the company's risks, it is written to you write: in the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the most political risk is that witstheous by the ever-existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Romani population of Hungary, it may also be the occurrence of violent ethnic clashes, HIV-integrate, in the short term.
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to be aimed at proving such an action  is supplied by the research institute.
As you write, this can be explained by one of the most negligent of the most negligent of the Hungarian political leaders: the Crulent debate on the Roma issue was left to the representatives of radical and extremist political groupings who could have built the political strategy, ′′′′H., on the Romani-Hungarian contradiction.
This deepens the problem, making it impossible for normal dialogue, reinforcing the extremists, and adjusting the likelihood of violent conflicts  the institute reckons.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media , largely spoiled the image of Hungary abroad, as far as the faith in the stability of the country and its democratic maturityom are concerned.
The institute recalls: Part of the reorganisation of the Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which have been receiving a growing publicity and vehemence since the autumn of 2006, it is that several organisations have formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which are called themselves as associations National militia languages.
The common feature of these groupings is that they define themselves as civil associating, while openly preaching  and armed  the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the case of self-clay disasters, the assault on the country, disturbing order), in addition, citing the incompetence of the police, the military, or the state, adds.
He goes on to note: this is done in a way that seeks to wrap up various political efforts built on society's opposition to politics and parties to civilian robes.
The embezzling of civility and the form of the association, therefore, in the case of these groupings, do not merely serve to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration, which is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a factor of the accustoming risk also in terms of neighbourly relations.
In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, the ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries, citing the creation of the Hungarian Guard, want to excuse their own anti-Hungarian policies.
This may have an impact on the political stability of the area, well adds.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not an isolated phenomenon, so the political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
As you write, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to, for example, the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
The background to the creation of the Bulgarian guard is the mass Romani riots that broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
BNU used this to establish the Guard with the aim of the organization being National militia.
In the past 17 years, according to her, the likes of which there has been an cicany terror in Bulgaria, the elevation of the state has remained inactive and indifferent, recalls the institute of Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a heated debate in the Bulgarian public.
As you go on to write, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes is signaled by the announcement of some Bulgarian Roma organisations to form their own guard as a sign of resistance.
Jelikožžžžto's activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not impossible that even the Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way by establishing their own militia, we can read in the risk warning drawn up by the Political Capital Institute.
Asked by the press office, Attila Juhász, research director at the Institute of Political Capital: the risk analysis was one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis for a year and if they find out something that could affect the change in risk, they report public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not all free
In Hungary, the days off are precisely laid down by law, and it has become a general practice for working days to move around the holidays, which is less than a few times in the next year.
In the European Union or in America, the holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and national holidays and non-working days.
Nose-rests with more than one weighed up to the church's feasts or to important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year's Day: the last day of the old and first day of the new year is a work day off  New Year's Day is to be able to take a break for people to relax after New Year's Eve.
During the year, we otherwise have a total of eleven free holidays.
The National Day is March 15, celebrating the 1848 and 23 revolution. October, the commemorative day of the 1956 Revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, work on 1st, November 1st and 2th, we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two-day holidays of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Jelikožej's state, national or religious holidays, according to the calendar, rarely fall for the weekend, it has become a practice of moving the working day in cases that we would only work one day before or after a holiday.
The price for the long weekends is the one that we stay on the job and in the apple the previous Saturdays.
We will work off the day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday that the Minister of Labour has been treated for years by the Special Decree.
The legislation applies equally to employers and their employed workers, to the public employees and to those in the public service.
It does not apply to ove companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or, with a view to their purpose, also operate in non-working days.
This year, the working order will be changed by the due date around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24th, the life of the country will almost stop by, or, according to the experience so far, more people spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve beforehand counters the women's time at the excuse or use a holiday in this way.
In the next year, several of their holidays fall to the middle, or the end of the week, so the rescheduling of the working day will be less this year.
For the first time, the calendar is transformed around the Labor Day so that workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday 2 May can be a rest day.
The next move is related to the Feast of the 23rd. October: Saturday 18. October will be worked instead of Friday 24.
The end of the year by the next year will be fully to be theth of the holidays, because from December 24th they will have almost a nonstop holiday despite New Year's Eve on Wednesday.
est deterring the little things you can use to get your colleagues
The e-mails we forget to send, voice messages that we will never receive, the innocent lieswehe we hardly ever pay for: it prints to the 8h, the ITs on the work.
The question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences or put on your gloves and you will deliberately avoid the vague situations that may upset others.
Tips.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were wanted from the marketing department, well, your colleague will announce.
be the case for that, did you miss the rally?
In a better case, he regrets it and tries to make it right, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot to pass the message (that's less common design).
Most often, a matter solved by one apology is.
Before that, it would come to an embarrassing apologetite, it's a good idea to think about what you might be able to prepare awkward moments for your colleagues, and consciously try to prevent it.
Are you borrowing something that's not yours?
There's nothing uncomfortable when you reach out for a document or office or a phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember that you half-grafted your table on the table yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover on the table of one of your colleagues your pen, which you were summoning for the lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll rightly be mad at you for going through their things.
Don't take envelopes or adhesive papers from the office, because it's impossible to be uncomfortable if you run out of it prematurely, and you'll need them in an instant.
Gossip about the private party of colleagues?
There is no good design to stop the posting gossip.
Who, with whom, what did he do?
Where and why?
You don't know about the nose of your report (himps) about the private life of your colleagues!
When one of them shares with you in the innermost secrets, don't abuse his trust!
Lose in yourself what you have heard, and in his absence, do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
For no reason, do you report your absence?
If you call the office and, citing a strong headache, you report your absence because you are unwell, or you say to yourself today you would rather rest, think about the fact that you have the job, the urgent tasks and the work that they have a certain date, someone else will have to do for you.
Consider your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work, or something that makes you have to stay at home, to announce that your colleagues and managers are not confronted with your absence and the next day.
Backup, giggle, phone calls
You've been immersed in work, rumored to be rude to the giggles of a female colleague?
Did you inadvertently witness a telephone conversation that would have been better not to have even seen?
Don't disturb your coworkers by humming, chanting, loud talk (overhead of them), or stomping, incessant cooping, loud discontent.
It's all to be diversified even when they're not being taken into any project (written, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for the mistakes?
If something is not on time or have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame for your forgetfulness of others!
Do not appeal to the possible chaos in the office and the noisy colleagues!
Admit it if you've made mistakes and someone's paid the price, and correct the damage!
Ask how you could put the matter right, correct the negligence!
Do you feel at home in your office?
Warmers and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, not suitable for the office!
Leisure clothes don't wear off, even if the profession allows it!
Don't be sloppy, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in the runtime ... and if it is the profession that makes it, nicely and elegantly!
When one wants to suit, one ceases to be interesting
A move in the usual morning traffic jam.
From the radio, there's a special tune: the sound of the violin, with electronic effects attached to it.
Adding the volume.
Music changes the pace and the previous one's trombone is added to the bass, then the congregation is joined as a real jewel.
On mr2 station, the song by the Zagar group, called Wings of Love, reads.
The domestic musical, long for a long time, did not mute us with quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, though, the traffic across the constipation looks quite different, because you're listening to the new Zagar album.
The revelations of Yonderboia, a few new and interesting productions from the homemade digital underground, slowly change the overall picture, and although it is back in vogue for guarring rock with its pounding on the guitar, even the home electropop proves that something new is under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Five-Eight and he also played in Yonderboi's band, and in the end, ... and in the end, perhaps, that two bagpipers will not fit into one of the bars  they went their own way.
With his project (Zagar) as well as the music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to dig through, and when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc Török Szezononomito film Ferenc).
His formation, playing in the early days of the smaller clubs, was recognized by its audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album from 2002 among the fifty-most-most-legged home records, and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as almost the only domestic developers that could be saleable in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly vic in the course at home, though of course they were not asked if they were satisfied with this label.
The band responded to how it was: they made a new, better album.
The now released album, Cannot Walk F Instead, can open up new avenues for them, although the title itself is trying to create a continuity with the initial flights in the Five-Eleg.
This is one of the verses from the track of the old band Balázse Zságer.
The reference to the ethereno, flying would be in order, and in addition to the ethereal hint of this music, it has now appeared in the  In keeping with the spirit, the trend of the time  the loudly rhetoric, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the album's premiere in Millenáris Park was presented by singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle.
The album was also produced by one real radio hit, thanks to the song mr2 Petőfi, playing popular music late from morning to evening, began to be wrestled with the sweeping melodies of Wings of Love, recorded with the yore-six domestic singers (Underground Divasomo9.
So all right (?).
Hvg.hu interviewed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In the context of this new hit, the question is, how much is left with fringe music what you play?
Balázs Zságer: Definition of fringe music doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different caste of light music; not mainstream and underground, not an alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Even the so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and it's just as it's supposed to be made just for the sale that makes it commercial.
We'll also in the Illusion's good pop piece can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude of how it is adopted also works, independently of language and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, the day before we go west, the light music has a higher tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their twenties who go to concerts, but also older people.
They watch much more on the transformations of the light music surrounding them, because they also command it as part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter to you who, where and in how much of your music is listening to?
B. Zs.: Of course it feels good that more and more people are coming to see our concerts.
But we've never made music for the market.
In our country, music is not born with a goal, but for some reason.
The roles of the audience can be seen in concerts where mutual influence works, but it is hidden only in the unaccomable transformations of the moment.
Still, I've come to know that when you want to suit the audience, you've stopped being interesting ever since.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works solo and has built his career out of us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don't actually go his way, regardless of how he doesn't find music to ever try to explain.
We're sleeping team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was no longer avoiding the fact that our work was not likened to the songs of Yonderboie, until a few of us separated from his band and went a different path.
hvg.hu: In the topsy-tank-based rider of the station mr2 Petőfi, the track Wings of Love came first.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
With a popular style, you consciously opened up to the more layers?
B.Zs.: We weren't planning to write a hit song to sell the record.
The song is about more.
We lamented it as the final of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and the essay themes.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is  what was the guiding principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then he came up with the idea of assembling this choir from the soloists of the domestic music scene with a good voice.
So got together this six-man choir  Sena, Edin Kutzora, Judia Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then dubbed the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Exactly that's how you waved the song, or did the girls make a remodine about it?
B.Zs.: The composition of the sludge was long in the instrumental version, when the material was then taken to the board, we thought that something would be needed for this song.
A trail of chords he seduced him to join him in the singing part.
Earlier that day at night, I sang a tune on him that the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it got the act, but of course it took the Divas.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that way vigorously.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert it seemed that the girls were in the background.
They don't have a solo (except for Judy Jay), they don't have a role to play, they sing together, and they're not loud when the music is just not accompanied by their singing.
Also on the stage they stood at the back.
Is that on purpose?
B.Zs.: That, the back of the way, was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to divide solo roles is, on the contrary, intentional.
Even the song is about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where it's from, where it belongs to, and just let ourselves be wings of love uplifted by the wings of love.
I wanted the others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which was the most work with?
B.Zs.: During the music's composing, not even one, the most of the pieces were found to be sleeping when mixing.
For example, Dorian Graylusives Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or RockarrésnationallyRoll Goes To The Girls, where he did not want to function groove for a long time, then all nicely slowly took his place in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new record is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That's what's always changing with concerts and the fact that I've released the I′I've been releasing the record.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous broker risked billions of inferiority
Treacherous embezzler.
That is how the former employee of Jerome Kerviel marks the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komerční banka.
It had lost nearly five billion euros to his cause.
But it seems more like Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to match his colleagues and certainly not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market early.
"He's mentally weaker," came the mouths of his superiors, who had sent the police to him.
But, as Kerviel's testimony carried out by French media, such as Le Monde, he was a man who had profits of €1.6 billion in profits from his business at the end of last year.
Crises not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
In the summer, it was the US crisis that he managed to make half a billion euros.
He sensed the opportunity early in the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had problems with repayment in the past, would be in trouble.
But the whole economy was not to be affected by this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet right.
At the end of the year, its profit then climbed to €1.6 billion.
"Even when I made the first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't keep anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he falsified the records so that he would not be discovered.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even as the Eurex exchange became interested in his business.
Risk was profit
Was he afraid he'd come over?
More like no.
"I thought it was just the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he get the will to risk so much?
He had to work his way up to his position.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker, and in 2005 he became a self-employed broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never make as much as the others.
"I knew at my first interview in 2005 that I was being gnawed at.
Because of my education and also for my professional and personal development," Kerviel described to the investigators.
But shortly after the onset came the first great success.
With the stock, Alllianz made a profit, as it was betting half a billion euros in the bombings of London to drop the title.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you go
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses knew, or rather suspected, of everything.
"As long as I made the money, they turned a blind eye."
But then came a blow at the beginning of this year.
He lost €1 billion in a single day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to cover it up.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros to it.
And how did they find him?
He became the suspect for his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who is not allowed is a broker who does not want to be looked at his records," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to raise 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the funds the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will be increased by the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and businesses to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
In the current absorption of money from EU funds, the Czech Republic is still among the least successful in the newly adopted countries.
20-year sentence for ex-President Nicaragua upheld by court
The Court of Appeal in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for the country's former president, Arnold Aleman, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (nearly $1.8 billion).
He was later released from prison and home under house arrest at his hacienda, near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of this Central American state will go back to prison from 1997 to 2002 is unclear at the moment, according to the AP.
According to the president of the appeals court, Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials to have Aleman served his sentence at home or go to prison.
The court four years ago proved to Alemán that he regularly moved the government's money to the accounts of foreign businesses in Panama.
These companies were fictitious, and the accounts were in fact his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of that money then ended up in the fund that Alemán based on financing his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved the budget
It is so.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget set up by this government and the coalition's adopted majority without the support of the opposition.
He passed for this year with the support of the ČSSD last year, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the ČSSD could not afford to accept it.
Unlike the busy debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic was happening this time.
The Chamber of Deputies, the traditionally overlooked, even though the most influential, passed the bill in peace.
It's a paradox.
Each reign begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government's power rivalry with the opposition.
This is more media-grateful and therefore pays much more attention to it in the media.
The argument of politicians is much more interesting to the public than the austere figures.
Government budgets in past social democratic governments have suffered from three ailments that the one for 2008 is unable to resolve at once:
The first is a high proportion of the statutory mandatory, so-called mandatory expenditure, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits that were approved by the tacit "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM before the elections.
The second is the deficit management as a result of the ailments of the first.
The third limit is public finance deficits, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of towns and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of towns and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to tax, fees, and loans from banks, to obtain additional resources for investment, often recklessly issue bonds to take on their town halls inappropriately into debt.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other grids they received from the state in privatisations.
Now they no longer have this source.
If we stick to official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, which is constantly boasted by the CSSD.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put the public finances in order.
Instead, they were increasingly in debt to the state.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, were farmed much more wisely than our republic.
It is a huge embarrassment that falls primarily on past governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least at risk of poverty.
There is therefore no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have, in recent years quite unnecessarily swelled to gigantic proportions.
Even if some of the nonsensical populist spending approved in the run-up to the election this year has been abolished, if there is no near-term shift in the pension and pension reform, then, in fact, any policy in this country will effectively end up, and whoever governs it will be just being held.
It is with little exaggeration to say that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money for pensions and social benefits.
That is why this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the dispersing of normal spending by discretionary.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments did not do their best in the last decade.
If we do not really want the ruling politicians to become mere officials, then we must be patient and give this not-so-strong coalition government that realises that the state can only issue as much as it can obtain in taxes and fees, to prepare for more reform laws.
Only these will allow for the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks to tackle crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
This will bring more than $100 billion to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, the banks are auctioning off the interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
The US Fed, for example, will send forty billion dollars to auction, and another twenty-four will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time following the attacks of September 11th that national central banks have agreed to take such coordinated action to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This move is to address the economy's biggest difficulties, a growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
"The coordinated action of the central banks reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to as much as fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in defaulted loans, mainly in the United States.
Analysts expect even more billions in losses.
"Central banks must really be afraid of what may yet follow when they opted for this course of action," said ABN's chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to the loans, they will also lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy into recession with the potential effects on the world's economic growth.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate, which is used for borrowing money in the interbank market.
This meant that the banks were still concerned about borrowing each other, even though the US, Canada, and Britain's central banks had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that central banks' move will contribute to the crisis's upright because it does not address the underlying problem, and that is the collapse of the US housing market.
Klaus: Environmentalist debates are incredible
Global climate change is most intended to damage developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been levelled at the UN International Conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, Not Green Planet, he said that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which is a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and the reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks display of words that are a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech president, when presenting his book, stressed that its topic was very important to him and therefore is so involved for them.
He also expressed satisfaction that the book also appears in German translation, because, as he said, "often I only encounter caricatures of my opinions."
So now those interested can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that while he is not a climatologist, he believes he has ample the prerequisites to write such a book.
Indeed, he is an academic, able to pursue and assess scholarly treatises, has experience in statistics and is also a national economic.
He described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing as the main findings of the book, and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no equal view of all scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not very large and severe and thus do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective, and unacceptably costly.
Moreover, as a man with experience with totalitarianism, he sees it as unacceptable for the imposition of unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction on freedom.
Asked by those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefit."
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
Driver's license failed to be exchanged by 600,000 people
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to exchange an old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day for people to apply for the exchange so that the authorities can still issue a new pass to them by the end of the year.
But the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would travel to the road after the New Year without a valid licence.
According to the authorities, the licence was not exchanged mainly by those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While municipalities report a yielded decline in interest in the replacement of their license, the authorities in the metropolitan area are overwhelmed with applications and interest in the exchange of the licence increased this week.
The city's aloofs around 2,000 clients a day.
The queues are expected to be about half an hour.
In Prague, some 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged a driver's license.
The new card takes 20 days to issue a new pass.
However, it is possible to request extradition within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver will pay five hundred crowns extra.
Motorists who fail to make the mandatory exchange of their licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid licence will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of CZK 2,000.
But a policeman can also handle the offence by agreeing.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will be CZK 2,500.
According to earlier information, a man who would not go anywhere could have been fined by the town hall.
He was reportedly able to pay CZK 30,000.
The ministry previously called on the authorities to be mild and impose a maximum fine of $1,000.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, however, no one is in danger of tens of thousands of dollars in fines.
A driver's license, according to him, is a testament where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not the ID card that every person has to have a valid one.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driving licence.
Just take it or send it by registered mail to the relevant municipal office.
With the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and 1993/9 will cease to apply.
But motorists are also required to gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to replace them.
The validity of the cards, which were issued between 2001 and 2004, will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million additional documents.
Court cuts sentences to officers in association with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who are accused of criminal association with the David Berdych gang, will go to prison for 13 and ten years.
This was finally decided by the Prague High Court, which thus reduced their sentences, one by one by a year and the other by two years.
Initially, detectives at the Prague Department for Combating Organised Crime were at risk of 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, only an appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
While Berdych is also indicted in this case, he is yet to receive a first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences in the sum of more than 16 years.
That's all he can get.
In January, the Regional Court found 19 people guilty of participating in the robbery, in particular, and the High Court today dealt with the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused indictments have since the investigation began, saying it was a trumped-up case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, among others, handed over information from police sources to the criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang handed over 30 percent from the loot for Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment is a gang crime from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, whose victims have often suffered serious personal injuries, but also about abuses of public office and illegal firearms.
In fact, during house searches, police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core missiles, a laser targeting device or a submachine gun.
The gang, according to the charges, cost tens of millions of crowns by the robberies.
In addition to the nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other robberies by Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men from around Berdych are still pleading guilty in court in another trial, some cases have not yet been taken to court.
The main trial has so far been avoided by Tomas Půt and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish custody, awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child substitution bill: 12 million
For the substitution of children in the maternity ward, the lawyer for the children in the maternity ward, Igor Veleba, wants to be compensated by CZK 12 million for the hospital in the maternity wages, plus court costs.
For each mother of three million, for fathers, two million each, and a million for the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The hospital's attorney, Ondřej Dostál, therefore strongly disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a demand, it is very high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"But we can make up our minds about the counter-process, however, we need an expert opinion commissioned by the opposing party.
We'll find out if it has any of the accompanying value.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál pointed out.
According to him, the amount should be between CZK 100,000 and 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jabloňov wanted one million crowns for each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleba served as the basis for the negotiation of the compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motole.
The children's parents, according to psychology experts and psychiatrist, suffered psychological damage and stress in various grades and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by the men, although they were faced with reproaches that they had not prevented the mix-up of the newborns.
Women, in turn, find it harder to cope with the news of the trauma, and the content of Veleba's current thing.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Perth maternity ward on December 9 last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermáková to Přibyslavic and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The Highland Commissioner, Miloš Vystrčil, handed over to each of the families at the end of October CZK 100,000 for the expenses they incurred by the mistake of the Třebíč hospital being set up by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for liability for damages.
In the event of misconduct, they must reach into the reserve fund, exceptionally they can apply for the assistance of the promoter.
The courts have so far awarded people relatively low compensation, with sums calculated according to the tables in the hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Polívka loses Wallachian Kingdom
Bolek Polívka lost the controversy over the brand name of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, the designation of the Wallachian King was first used, but the project was built by a long-standing work by a team around Tomáš Harabiš, who worked with the actor.
Polívka did not attend the meeting today.
According to his lawyer, however, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing the popularity of Bolek Polívka," Polívek's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone at the words of the Wallachian Kingdom recalls the actors and the comedian.
The same view is made by Harabiš.
"We're almost ten years behind us.
Finding money and inventing actions," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"Years later, they realized that the project was successful and could get something out of it.
They want to parasitize our work," he added.
The lucrative business
According to the court, the designation of the Wallachian king was first used by Polívka in his television programme.
It was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý in 1993.
But it was not related to the intention to build a fictitious kingdom at the time.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
The original recessionary action turned out to be a business and a lucrative entrepreneurial activity, which Harabiš then followed up with the founding of the Wallachian Kingdom.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to post his name and signature in the passports and even offered their holders a discount on a visit to his farm and theatrical performances.
Who will take the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš only took advantage of the bare idea Polívka disclosed in a ring for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who devoted themselves intensively to it.
The cooperation of the now-beautious parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, divisions have begun to pile up between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the removal of "Kingle Bolesław I, elected to the world."
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken up by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as the Queen Mother as the Queen.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which was dismissed by the court today.
Clarity could bring to the controversy with Harabiš's forthcoming race for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
Details and the deadline he did not want to reveal yet.
"We don't want to rush into anything.
It should be like the riding of kings in Slovácko.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Soup can sign up," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudice
As a matter of fact, I've never been a fan of the Peugeot 206 very much.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the gearshift, the steering and also the production could sometimes be described as below average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is a lot better.
And the estate called SW goes a little further, and I have no choice but to think better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207, I complained about the head space on the back seats, for example.
That's the end of the complaints here, because the estate car body means that even two-metre tall men will not suffer from it.
Fly the world
I'll get over the interior very quickly so I don't do much more.
This is a fairly hilarious design where I have the only rebuke to the poor centre tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer invention, now that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about the short seat cushions or backrests.
The lateral line also improved significantly against the 206.
As far as space is there, there is a sense of growth in the dimensions of the bodywork.
In the estate, the aforementioned lack of room overhead is disappearing.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main one on this car, then, is his luggage compressor.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (even thanks to the tilting back window) and as a decently storable.
Deaf spots are equipped with restraint rubbers, which are the ideal compromise.
It doesn't show, it can be stretched out, and it can be held up by heavier objects.
But let's pause to figure out the volume.
This is 428 l in the basic set-up according to the tables, which is more of an average value against the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the Škoda Fabia Combi.
Compare 207 SW with the new generation of teenager's product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging behind by a much noticeable 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or when a pram is loaded, this value is even critical.
But if I were to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the floor completely straight down after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 horsepower in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre spark-ignition 4-cylinder with an output of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 16-gauge one would look like to drive the family-run hatchback.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, it is pulling.
If I compare it to the damage-like, which sometimes feels like it has a stuffed rag into the exhaust, then I can only be thrilled with it.
Pricelist will tell
The price of the car is not folk.
However, we must remember that we tested a nicely equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with a petrol 14-per cap for CZK 329,900 will still be missed.
Our aggregate costs from CZK 410,900, which is quite a bit already.
The tested Premium equipment will then throw in the equipment for an additional £80,000 on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic weller-drift, electric rear window control...
Simply the car costs everything, £531,900.
It's a lot, but you can figure out the accessory kit at Fabia and you'll come to a lot of the same number.
So there's no choice but to decide on the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils at British schools is failing
Children from the countries of Eastern Europe are on the increase in the number of British schools, raising concerns among local residents for the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans, meanwhile, has faced a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of indigenous people are escalating into violence.
The problem of integrating children from Eastern Europe at British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Arguments, bullying and brawls between pupils have also been transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, police detained a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old pupil with an iron bar.
Guiltie defends the boy's insulting her with racist abuse.
Police had to intervene after the attack by two teenage girls on Slovak immigrants.
The girls allegedly chased the man with racist remarks and threw rocks at him.
"When we went home, a boy climbed to the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he lashed out at us with apples and pears, and then he revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils described another unpleasant incident to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents even called the controversy with immigrants from Eastern Europe a fight for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between local and immigrants is starting to be tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who headed here for work.
Roughly 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
It is truly an island of freedom for visitors.
Anything you expect from your holiday, that can come true if you choose correctly.
Golden and whitewashed beaches, high waves, or the sea, as peaceful as a pond.
Palm trees and all-inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and heady cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea, you'll find it in a complete and richer list.
But you will find much more on one island alone, and that island is Cuba, the biggest and prettiest of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba used to be a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye had ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and treasury of treasures that the Spanish had embarked and transported to Europe in America.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up at the very end of the 1920s.
It was built by one of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially for Prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba, with drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among them.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses were built in Havana, with cars on wide boulevards that were among the cult symbols of the 1950s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a homestead in San Francisco de Paulo, just outside of Havana, and had his yacht in Cojímar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, showbusiness stars were left with their signatures by politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls in Bodeguit, Havana, you can also leave your autograph.
The bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional will mix you a cocktail as you wish.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s are still driving around Havana, because the once imported jugs and the fiats in the salt and damp air have long since rotted.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is quite dilapidated, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments anywhere in the area as there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, like Trinidad.
As tourism brings much-needed money, its development is green.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana, but especially on Varadero, on the coast of Holguín province, as well as on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more indulgence, which is unique in the world and is particularly appreciated by the trainers.
The shtick from the sprawling plantations was brought to the sugar refinery on the narrow tracks of steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many of them for decades, so there are working machines to be seen, the contours of which are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba miss.
And so there's not much to write about Varadero or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in the aforementioned Hemingway estate and who likes this writer should not miss the visit.
Viňales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viňales Valley in the west of the island.
Bulleyed vegetation grows from limestone bedrock.
Mogots, limestone homoes and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil has taken hold in their hollows, which also makes the weathered rocks covered with dense foliage.
The valley is where perhaps the finest Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can find its final appearance if you visit one of the Havana cigar factories.
Perhaps it seems interesting to some people that the Chilean work of Major Zeman was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spaniards colonized the island.
The glory and wealth was brought to him by the slave trade and the sugar.
Wealth was reincarnated in the beauty and display of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, significantly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that as recently as the 1950s there was no road connecting the region to the rest of the country.
The isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing was built there, and that's why there was no need, everyone was glad to have a roof over their heads.
If a person has more time than one afternoon at Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as the beach of Playa Ancón, or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening it is for you to go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music in it fades down in the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the very east of Cuba is described by some as the prettiest on the island.
Surely such an opinion is influenced by the journey itself.
Both roads that lead there from Guantánamo must cross the high and rugged mountains and pass through a nature that has hardly been affected by human activity.
The eastern outpost of Cuba was inscribed by UNESCO on the World Heritage List thanks to its undisturbed nature.
They make the best chocolate there, the church has the Columbus Cross (in fact it was created about a century after the Columbus cruise) and from the hill, where the former castle and today's El Castillo hotel stand, several table-high mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigar-gather, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Isla de Pinos Island, the cabaret Tropicana, the shrine of the Cuban patron of Caridad del Cobre, the saneriet, the African religions espoused by the descendants of the former slaves, many pages could be described about.
But, as they say, see better once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
Few troops and the lack of necessary equipment are influencing the mission's progress in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
NATO, according to Defense Minister Robert Gates, should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not underway as planned, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, the leaders of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the mounting opposition from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are also discussing further plans and coordination of the allies today.
While the United States this week, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called on NATO forces to take more action, the UK sees a priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and the intensification of development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is palpable, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The next is to allow residents to kick-start the further development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels is the highest in five years, according to US military data.
The number of violent actions has risen by 27 percent compared to last year, and in the southern province of Helmand by as much as 60 percent.
NATO countries have roughly 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, roughly a quarter of them in southern territory.
But according to the United States, the Allies have reached the very limit in the organization and the equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific objectives for the coming time and the ways to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke in a similar sense today.
"I'm not happy about what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and the equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There has also been controversy among the participating countries in recent months about the fact that all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, was criticised for passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is minimal violence and the combat demands on them are not as high as they are to us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazily.
"Afghan's floats revealed: the Germans are playing while our boys fight," Sun wrote in the material, accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's Bild went on the counter-attack and printed a picture of the British troops in a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debt to rise to $1 trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the national debt is over CZK 84,000.
The total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better developments in the state budget management.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by CZK 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on the national debt in early October.
For every Czech, the debt is over 84,000 crowns.
For the whole of last year, the state was mortgaged by more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for next year, we could only surpass the CZK 1 trillion mark in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora sees it similarly: "We could get to the top one trillion to exceed this in the course of 2009.
Exactly when it will depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene turned out to be changed, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I do not anticipate this change," he said.
Dollies rise
The national debt is made up of the central government's debts and is mainly generated by the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The national debt is financed by treasury bills, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt has risen by 38.5 billion this year to CZK 719.4 billion.
The state's foreign debt has grown by CZK 1.7 billion this year to CZK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable national debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt year-on-year for the first to third quarters grew by 13 percent, which is really a lot for how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated for bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is wrong that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that it will do what it deals with when the pension reform is here," Pikora commented on the data.
Better than expected
The 2007 strategy for financing and managing the national debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion thanks to better developments in the state budget management.
The amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which will probably reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the projected CZK 91.3 billion.
They are also the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency 13.3 billion crowns, a ten-billion-dollar reserve for the disbursement of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of CZK 1.8 billion.
Woman to appear at the court in Khartoum today for giving a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher, on trial in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison and expelled by one of Khartoum's tribunals on Thursday evening, as her lawyer put it.
The British woman was accused of having to let sheer-headed pupils up to seven-year-old pupils name Muhammad, despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is forbidden.
She was punished with a whiplash.
This 54-year-old teacher, who works at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several pupils filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in reality as early as the month of September, when the teacher in question asks her six to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
"Fourginled the children's mouths, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," the school's director, Robert Boulos, tells us.
After voting takes place in the classroom, 20 of the 23 children will eventually be selected as the most popular name by Mohammed.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their classroom with a picture of a teddy bear accompanied by the caption: "My Name is Mohamed."
The bear himself had no label with this name on him, but the difficulty is in the very depiction of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim Muslim fellow Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, clarified that he knew it well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious beliefs: "I merely regret asked the children to vote for a name," he said, it was merely a "innocent misconduct."
This is also shared by many of the teachers' pupils, who describe it as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that"themality does not ever speak of religion in the classroom."
Recall that the first name Muhammad is also the second most frequently awarded first name in the UK, with 14 different in English.
This first name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules on the use of that first name?
For example, is it possible to give them a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
At the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Ultimately, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians ended their sixth round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome the different views on the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to heed their commitments to keep to the peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a challenging period," he added, noting that "it is evident that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on 10th December
The negotiators of the Troika, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their last trip to Kosovo on Monday.
The province's future, with 90 percent of Albanian-speaking populations, could be shown in a clearer light on December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko, are to hand over their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN, in August of this year, commissioned the Troika to renegotiate.
The Americans and Europeans are counting on the talks to be concluded on 10 December.
The Russians, who had earlier blocked Kosovo's independence from the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue after this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a solution negotiated, a compromise solution," said Bocan-Charchenko.
A one-sided declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance of the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU-supervised one viable solution.
Pristina states that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is prepared to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," announced the president of the Kosovo Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where this "fifthly chance" was taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, a former rebel commander of Kosovo's Albanians and the provincial's future prime minister, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "is a history that led to murders and deportations."
"Domin effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadić, on the other hand, believes that the compromise still comes to mind and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the province's possible unilaterally declared independence.
Belgrade is said to be particularly concerned about the "dominium effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"But this does not mean for Serbia," he said, "that the compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally possesses a veto.
"The Cosov Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, only a solution from the Security Council is acceptable," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica.
"These negotiations took two years.
It must end as it began: at the Security Council's floor."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the last word on status will be given to the Kosovo Parliament" and added that if there were a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking people, it would be done "after an agreement" with the West.
Bush has won a deal against the Israelis and the Palestinians
At the opening of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened at his instigation, US President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
He specified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations with the intention of resolving the 60-year-long dispute between the two nations once and for the time.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything he could to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must put an end to colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations of both sides from the "road map" to peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House official stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aimed at "closing a peace treaty that would resolve all undecided issues without exception, including central issues."
This statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees banished in the 1948 conflict from their homes in the territory of the present-day state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor for the US president, emphasizing that the subsequent negotiations were "overwhole and thorough" and to touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, the border, the colonies, the water, the security, among other things."
Then Olmert stepped down to the stands, expressing his opinion that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it was necessary to "advocate for it to be concluded during the course of 2008."
Bush identified the end of 2008 as a date for the realization of his "vision of two states," the Palestinian and Israeli, the awardsled.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has made a commitment from Bush to this effect before deciding to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel in exchange for abandoning all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially as it fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," reckons Prince Saud in an interview he has given to an Arabic-speaking diary embedded in Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police officers are not responsible.
What happened on Sunday, exactly?
As is always the case with such small reports from the black chronicle, the official versions do not match what is said between people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of an investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), the police car was passing through Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but it was on patrol and was passing at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h, while the lateral lights were not switched on," explains the police source.
The green Kawasaki motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore unlicensed to drive on public roads" (read below), driven by two youths without a helmet, was passing through "very high speed."
"The motorcycle rammed the police car from the left side after failing to give way from the right," one officer clarified.
A blood alcohol level test on the vehicle's crew showed negative.
The condition of the car (a punched front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) is indicative of the violence of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontois (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givra reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that IGPN had commissioned investigating "unsignal killing and failing to provide assistance to those at risk" at the same time embending on the direction départementale de la sûreté publishedlique du Val-d'Oise (respectations of the Val d'Oise Regional Department).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said the IGPN's investigation precluded, at this stage, the responsibility of the officers for the accident.
The three witnesses to the accident who were interviewed on Sunday night confirmed, according to the clerk, "a repatrious of the police, that the mini-pot was approached by them quite quickly from the left."
A kind of groove, no doubt caused by the friction of the cliphene on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained wedded until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles were secured and will undergo a technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of the two victims yesterday.
What happened, right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, people's talk of being quickly sparked among the people that officers were to leave the scene of the crime quickly without giving first aid to two young men.
The IGPN should have also, in all caution, ruled out "any serious offense" at this point.
"It is a more challenging aspect of the investigation, which requires more searches and with which you need to be very careful," the police source said.
The daily "Libération" met an eyewitness for the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows runs right where the accident took place.
"Immediately, my cousin and I, who is a nurse in the hospital, have rushed down to try to resurrect them," this witness tells us.
There was nothing we could do."
He then saw "the limping, a completely terrified policeman.
Two others were trying to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth spoke on the phone.'
In the face of rapidly mounting tension and the certainty of the youngsters' situation that the youths' situation was hopeless, the officers were taken away by the car of a colleague who had arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the officers left."
They also performed CPR, but to no avail.
"Let no one say the police authorities have not rushed to the youths' aid.
These young men were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived at once.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the declaration of exceptional condition by General Musharraf, two days before.
In the city of Lahor, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against measures taken as part of an exceptional state, tear gas grenades were injured, which witnesses said were used by the riot police.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar to scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court attorneys called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were blocked by roadblocks on Monday morning to prevent a rally.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the movement of lawyers received the support of religious parties grouped in the politically strong Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "fearing the population to send flowers to judges who oppose the exceptional state and the garbage to those who were sworn in before Musharraf."
"Musharaf's promise doesn't apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to comment on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election of the 6th. October.
Court President Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry has been removed and replaced.
"All of what we are witnessing is unlawful, unconstitutional and against the rulings of the Supreme Court," the official said in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to surrender to the leadership of the army and become a civilian president," he is not repaid" after the introduction of the extraordinary state, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeo said on Monday.
He was expected to be relinquished with a military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential mandate was completed.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has otherwise also refuted speculation in the country that the deputy head of the army should have ordered President Musharraf house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancy is still made up of unexpected pregnancies
This calculation includes pregnancy unwanted (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly planned.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is still unexpected today, reveals a study conducted by the French National Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined)- the National Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption so-called. The Neuwirth Act, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes pregnancy unwanted (24%) as well as poorly planned or unexpectedly planned.
Various contraception methods, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show a rate of 5% to 6% of the failure rate, Ined estimates.
After all, the insuring of contraception allowed for a better "fat fertility check," the institute says, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptive in women between the ages of 20 and 44 was now up to 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight of the births out of ten are now well planned.
One pair in five even have a birth calculated to be exact and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of year for the birth of a child.
Remainable repair of the space station
For more than seven hours of work in space, astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed to make a remarkable repair of the torn solar panel necessary for the station's further scientific work.
It was a risky ascent of space, which racked up records in terms of duration, distances from the living-developers, the speed with which the "clutenery" rates the astronaut had spent on repairing it.
Trouble arose on Tuesday, while the astronauts from the Discovery ship unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical formation designed to install a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pier for the modulator-laborator.
But these need to be supplied with electricity.
The crew's second task, therefore, was to move the 17-and-a-half-tonne module producing electricity using solar panels, which was already on the ISS, so as to anchor at its final post.
After moving it, the crew began to lay out the module's sixty-seventh-three solar panels.
And in that, one of the panels, decomposing like a lane, as a result of the cable's pickup, was damaged on an area of nearly a meter.
The layout has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
The astronauts who were originally supposed to perform a control exit on the Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was malfunctioning, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go fly to the end of the ship's robotic arm, added to the station's shoulder, and to make the repairs.
He is one of the best "spacewalkers" (space walker) of the Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very skilful, has a very toned chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by the doctor to "operate" the "porned" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the faulty cable and fastened some "legs" to the damaged areas.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the calibration chamber, as well as from the inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, the mini-hockey-olds with an insulating device to prevent the electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was invented and "after the DIY" made by the astronauts on board the station.
After the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was completely laid out and then zinventarized his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday, as scheduled for them.
EADS shares weaken
EADS shares are losing appreciably on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the company, operating in the aerospace and defence industries, announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to face a delay in the A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now €21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its projected production results for 2007 as a result of delays arising from the slow progression of the advance of the development of the A400M engine, which is a precondition for the inaugural flight.
The cost of mitigating delays in the supply of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was valued "to €1.2 to €1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European designer EADS announced.
Because of these costs, EADS, next Thursday, at the presentation of its quarterly results, will be forced to announce a new profit outlook before interest and tax deduction (EBIT) deductions.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate was six months late.
Recall that the EADS production results in 2006 fell 86% mainly due to the costs associated with the delay in another programme, the giant A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group had expected to provide the first delivery of the A400M to the French military in October 2009.
Decision for status quo
Sunday's election will take place without a tense expectation: the Russians will overwhelmingly elect the party of President Putin, the United Russia.
Confirming so, after the end of a very few free election campaigns, their gravitationalise to stability, and even to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the House of Commons elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will tell voters a pre-recorded TV message to voters on public-law stations, but whose content is kept secret.
He is doing so as leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which is expected to celebrate a landslide victory.
When he received the ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the President let nothing out of him and content himself with another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want an honest, as transparent and open election as possible, an election without the slightest flaw in the beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is not nearly so.
They condemn the campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "it has never been such a dirty election, even under Yeltsin."
After repression accompanying last weekend's demonstrations, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, he continues to be banned from visiting, according to his aloft.
"Rusov remained the mentita homo sovietica"
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple tense anticipation, two far more open questions are profiled:
"Who will become Putin's successor in the presidency?
The official paper yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates may present themselves to the public by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third mandate in a row.
But no follower emerges.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the almighty United Russia party, which will choose the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the entire line in the parliamentary elections, as well as in the presidential election.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have been left with the homo sovietica mentality, they do not feel like the masters of their fate," believes sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center of Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kohazov of the State University of Sankt-Petěrburg notices more temporally closer connections: civil society has picked up, Christian to five centuries across Europe in this country, a Christian to a Christian Five Century After Europe; the famous common spirit has delayed shaping individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s "Putin followed up on the state's paternalistic model, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by a certain economic welfare," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today are "voluntarily relinquishing personal responsibility" which they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think about it?"
This phenomenon applies to all social sciences, including the business world.
Even the clerical elite intend to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of the Russian regions) are being run by the local candidates of the United Kingdom of Russia.
The new freedoms taken over from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Čerednichenko, a 54-year-old professor: "Why think about it?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Weighted memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fates of the 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are being opened to the public.
47 million archive documents stored for a period of 27 km in the length of J.A. in Bad Arolsen (Hess) were, until this time, accessible only to the "humanitarian" purpose, that is to say, individually and in name, upon request to the former victim or her authorised persons.
Eleven states in charge of the archives - including Germany, France, Israel, and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratifying this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to examine "in particular the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of the forcibly working," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives, directed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, among them Germany, were against making these nominated documents available to the public, because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
After the war, the registries of concentration camps or the arrest war were collected for the practical purpose of finding the deported or forced labour subjected to civic citizens, to provide them with evidence of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent staff in Bad Arolsen are engaged in tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited contribution.
"Aparticit cannot be expected to do anything fundamentally new," Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism in Berlin's Technische Universität.
EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India is already spending nearly €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner in the ranking and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expecting the signing of the Free Trade Treaty in 2008, announced by European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to start negotiations with a view to signing the Cause de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is already spending nearly €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner in the ranking and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU's ninth trading partner.
"The free trade agreement will do tremendously to the two economies' and "India will gain better market access to the 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the first 10 products exported by India, the European Commissioner has specified. The Asian and European giants exchange "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in service" a year together, Danièle Smadja, the head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, said this week that bilateral trade "done not yet in its full potential." The EU and India will meet on Friday at the eighth joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi, with the participation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns and offered £10bn in five weeks auction
The Bank of England signaled on Thursday that it intends to alleviate the current fears of worsening again on credit market conditions and announcing a £10 billion offer in a five-week-week auction at a base rate of 5.75%, an offer in force for an unusually long time.
"In an attempt to ease the concerns that the conditions in the financial markets will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and give the banks more certainty about the way in which to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will begin on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," the Bank announced in a communiquet.
The Bank specifies that £10 billion (€14 billion) will thus be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at the base rate.
This seems to be the first time that the BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Normally, they last a week.
The BOE adds in its communiqué that it "remains ready to take further measures to maintain the interest rates on a day's basis" of interchange loans at the same level at its base rate.
The interbank interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6.6%, the highest figure since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the English Bank, coupled with the fee rates, which discarded the banks from using this offer.
According to some speculation boosted by the evolution of the pound's exchange rate against the euro, many preferred to opt for the sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, the Union for the Popular Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address the Socialists' (PA) proposals for the purchase of
UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the various paragraphs of the Socialist Purchasing Bill on Thursday, which ties to the rejection of the text.
The text of the bill was on the agenda under the so-called Socialist "risk" (a meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and included a dozen measures adopted by the Presidency of the PA on Tuesday, including an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the restoration of fluctuating TIPP, transport cheques or rent regulations.
With the UMP and NC voting against the discussion of the various paragraphs (180 against the 115), the session was closed after a general debate that became an opportunity to exchange opinion, sometimes more vivid, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised appearance.
The head of the PS's deputies, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his club would re-submend these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the Finance Bill, which the House will be debating next week.
The new festival is being born
As a result of much speculation that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, this Vineland Festival promoter/producer in New Jersey has announced in collaboration with the Festival Republic by British organizer Melvin Benn.
"It is an honour for our company to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration," revealed to C3's Charlie Jones from Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is the summer destination of the campers.
The festival is expected to take place from 8 to 10 August at a private 500-acre farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the festival, Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, is also in charge of the production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of the C3 calls Glastonbury the "most inspirational event" he has ever experienced and says that his firm and Melvin Benna's company are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
"Originally, we chose Philadelphia as the market, and the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in the center of Philadelphia," Charlie Jones says.
"We were meeting with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, we got bogged down in politics because of the city's current leadership, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are about to set up a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Grant Park, Chicago, in 2005, after a showcased Austin City Limits Music Festival on the festival stage in 2002.
The gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of the Melvina Benn festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place more in green spaces in the cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two concepts in a certain way to create both the impression of a rural festival in Europe and an American city."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the realization of the event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says "that they are beneficial enough to allow for an investment in such an event and to welcome the festival, which will hopefully be of long duration."
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high," similar to that of the Tennessee Bonnaroo Music Festival, which holds 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can be confirmed at the moment when the programme is only put to the press.
"Vineland will have a rock feel, but the music will be varied there to attract a wide range of viewers as far as possible," says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter Award in the final Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself ops against it...
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
But his mandate is "politically challenging" because the governor of the Californian, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "runaway productions."
Is it difficult to fall into the "Guvernator" claws?
"You need to be careful, it's the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer those that they will consider the best," he said.
Chasing festivals
For the moment, however, the priority for the moment is to promote the local film.
Already the pursuit of the Oscars has begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether they are festivals at Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing, highlighting the Quebec films and making sure that the carnivalers give interviews.
The Age of Darkness was in good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th annual Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also presented four short and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will the year-end marathon be on the stock market? Experts divided by 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the Administrative Year, and the investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, the experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif believes that "incental terms, December is a positive run for the month on the stock market."
However, forecasts are not intended solely on the basis of statistics, particularly because, in the current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, some doubts."
These experts do not expect the stock exchange to get moving in the last weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially of a fixed income affected by the effect of a turnaround to high-quality securities, both in long and short periods."
That is why they believe that the stock market will have a rather calm run, not a volatility, "primarily because the impact of the likely fall in FED (Federal Reserve rates) is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the risk of incentives to inflationary pressures."
Javier Barrio, the head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the time to make a bold declaration that there will be a marathon.
"There is little reason to rejoice," assures this expert.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum levels recorded on 8 November, when the index closed to 15,945.7 points.
Yet not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to the re-utilisation of portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension insurance that occurs each year at that time.
But this expert suggests that things will be a little different this year, as he believes that the marathon will happen sooner, in the second week of December after the long weekend of the Constitution.
The analyst in question does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
At the same time, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "so we could see the reflection of the index, triggered by US reports about the effects of the crisis in the credit market."
The analyst believes these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles to make Ibex the new maximum dimension.
The Intermoney's Solana confirms that "this year, it's the turn of strong titles."
This expert would include both big banks and some construction firms in the portfolio "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sector.
Construction firms will also be able to enrich themselves at this marathon if it happens.
"TheACS has been re-running positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and the FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technologies will also do very well, even if they are not very represented in the Spanish market in this field.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been month of downs in two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year was conducted in 2003, in an administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis triggered by the collapse of the technology bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, with a 6.68% increase in December.
We will see if 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in the ranking (so far Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will be able to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of the Popular bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a major change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of their branches until 8:30 p.m. and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.
BBVA, another group that also assured several times that it wanted to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet taken a decision on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of opening hours by one in the afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this Popular Bank's experience will be decisive for other players to join or not to join this initiative, which supports the opening hours of business.
That is exactly the goal of the project set out by the Popular Bank.
To acquire individual clients who pose to these places for their purchases, smaller and medium-sized companies, business owners and shops from selected streets where branches are opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as it is not a new branch opening, but only an adjustment already existing.
For this reason, the bank will modernise the branches it already has in its commercial zones by adapting them to the profile of clients on individual streets.
This is complemented by an extension of the opening hours by a further conception of the branch's space and a new, more recent, in lighter colours.
The Bank's business manager, Ángel Rivera, assures that this restructuring will not mean a major investment, but a greater recruitment of staff, as it is switched from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with small and medium-sized company meetings and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Popular has already tested the initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Ángel Rivera explains.
Branches on the streets of Madrid in Madrid were selected for Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, and according to River, it seems to be a lucky choice.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specialized in immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and open even on Sundays and holidays.
The PopularMax branches will not be watching the BBVA model, with a number of its branches offering a wide range of non-flagin products for sale.

Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 on the exchange for the first time
We did it.
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, the executive chairman of Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction at the end of the trading, when he noted that the television he is driving doubled the value of its rival Antena 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'What I regret is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we fell less down,' he said.
And yet he stressed that thanks to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco stopped trading yesterday by moving 2.54%.
This profit has pushed their loss for the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The CEam controlled by Mediaset's stock exchange value (with 52% in capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) thus amounts to EUR 4 488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its competitor, Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and has overall fallen by 40.5% since January, is close to 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecoms firms that have been valued is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, Prisa 2 518.53 million (Pinco Días) and Vocento 1.779 billion.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is offered, as we are talking about two similar firms.
A relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we rate it in the ratings.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects this year to become the first television channel to surpass a billion gross advertising revenue, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that provides advertising for the group.
Indeed, if the forecasting figure were to be achieved, this TV channel would see a 3.6% increase in advertising turnover this year, up from 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, Antenee's net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (as far back as $34,4 million), while the network's net revenue rose by 0.7% ($630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are targeting for Telecinco's best relative developments on the stock market is the increased pay out it has so far maintained: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, split 100% of its profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even if it is early to decide, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, who we have already increased the value of 33% of Endemol'.
Analysts say the market is showing some fatigue at these moments.
Lehman Brothers recently downgraded its Telecinco earnings estimates of 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected revenue growth has stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenena's projected profit of 3, at 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves MiFID's transposed as of November 1
In parallel to the parliamentary hearings, which were concluded today by the Congressional vote on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has subjected the public hearing to the regulations that develop the new law, with a view to both coming into force before the end of the year.
Party leaders have consistently highlighted the efforts of MPs and Senators to negotiate and agree the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the operators needed for the effective functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which is governed by the Securities Trading Act, envisages the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and encouraging cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will make it possible to provide financial advice services to both specialist firms and to individuals with legal entities, and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS) firms, financial advisory companies (AFIs) to join with securities, securities intermediate brokerage firms and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the performance of operations with financial instruments is being added to the regulated secondary markets by adding multilateral trading systems and command internalisation systems to compete with current stockbrokers.
Furthermore, the law obliges investment service firms to disseminate information on the market on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and the means of coping with risk, and requires a statement of all performed operations to facilitate the supervision by the CNMV.
During the hearing in the Commercial Commission of Congress, several modifications were included, among which the latter stands out, to be considered a "complex" financial instrument given the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the US with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the trans-conformisation of the directive was used to legally set out the functions that can be held by bachelor's bachelor's degree in ecosmar and business management 30 years after a royal decree was approved in 1977 to set out the professional roles reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary to operate externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client trading services for various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices in Spain developed during the month of November.
Its disclosure corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data at times and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This pre-prisputed indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modeling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this pre-primary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily have to coincide with the final figure, which will become known on 14 December of this year.
"TheIS will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said that the ISC's November increase to 4.1% was a "sign of temporary," but he also predicted that the price index would continue to be at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the congressional consecutive halls that "even if this is not a favorable figure," Spain's inflation differential vis-à-vis the monetary union has been "more or less" the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government had not anticipated such a high increase.
"We were expecting a value of around 4%," the Economy Minister said on the data presented today.
Virgin plans to make €44 billion with Northern Rock over three years
Since Northern Rock, Bank of Northern Rock, had fallen into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have plummeted by more than 50% to £12 billion (€16.8 billion).
At the time, the Bank managed record deposits worth more than £25 billion, which gradually fell during the two-and-a-half-month distrust of clients despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for that money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which replaces the entity's name with its Virgin Money business name, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenue invested in British banks in the next three years to raise the remaining £18 billion to reach the target of £30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known in the UK for his striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend £50 million (about €70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to make her resolution.
Northern Rock this week marked the offer of the Virgin consortium, which makes up three other companies, such as the one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
In the early hours of this morning, the Civilian Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcia city of Totana (from the People's Party) for his alleged involvement in the corrupt practices in the construction that were unveiled this week.
One of the town hall's secretaries and the local police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Molos, the current Peoples' MP, in May of this year, and until then the mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER, could have been the 'headquarters' of the entire business.
Officers continue to monitor the town hall buildings and the Construction Commission and no further arrests are being ruled out in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer for Juan Morales, the main suspect in the construction corrupt practices that were discovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As Cadena SER reported yesterday, the lawyer for the 'folk' MP, Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested on leaving Morales' residence with important documents linked to corruption.
Moreover, according to investigative sources, Morales's alleged collection of commissions for signing a construction agreement with a Galician construction company that has been reclassified by 200 hectares of land are being investigated.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer to lead the PSOE's Toledgetean and, if they win, to preside over the congress
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary General to José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to head the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) list in Toledo in Toledo in the next general election, he became the president of the Congress.
So, at a press conference, the secretary of the PSOE for the organization, Jose Blanco, and Bono himself, announced it at a press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero at noon today at the party's federal headquarters.
The executive's chief of staff justified the offer to the former minister on the grounds that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best."
He further noted that "yes, it appears to be that this politician from La Mancha will be the Socialist Party's candidate for the presidency of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as chairman of Congress, who unveiled his decision not to run in the next general election on November 15 and leave his active political career to pursue the fight against climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the Prime Minister kept urging him to return to the top politician he had left two years earlier.
He also said that, as well as citizens, they knew who the Deputy Minister of Economy would be, if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce who would preside over the congress.
If Bono gets this job, he hopes to transform the House into a "house of respect and not swearing or shouting" and making it more and more like the citizens."
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where it is not easy to speak is Congress to speak, the Prime Minister in the Senate on one occasion was interrupted 26 times on one occasion."
He also spoke the laudatory words to the current president, Manuel Marín, and "its good job of his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place so far that he would not descend to the fact that he said what his opponents might consider "greatness."
Climate propaganda
With the anti-Citime Climate Change Movement subjecting mercilessly persecution to both those who view his predictions as well as those who prefer other political and social struggles, they must demonstrate solid cohesion.
Moreover, to have a movement leader who is Prime Minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet."
This proposal forces him to explain why his government's activities or inaction have made a significant contribution to Spain's failure to comply with the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this non-fullings, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the treaties, did not prevent it.
Moreover, it forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spaniards what measures he intends to take to hinden the climate change.
Which companies will be harmed by this, which population habits will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective ones, we will have to accept and what the economic consequences will be.
In other words, who sacrifices and who will pay to save the planet.
But we have not received such explanations, nor will we see.
Precisely because you need to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, genuine measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one centim of the petrol price, the proposed PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapater in terms of the election that he hastened to reject it.
In other words, this is to save the planet in a way that costs nothing, pure propaganda, slogans lacking any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And treaties with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that neither speak nor blames, demands anything, but is the ornament of the rallies and makes him tender.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contractor party and not asking for us to ride a bike and cooling ourselves with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totany detained on suspicion of corrupt construction practices
As investigative sources reported, the Civilian Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totana, "Secublse" of José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one hospitality businessman, on suspicion of committing the crimes of construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and transferred to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located with a number of police officers who also attended the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the management of industrial land and flats.
These three arrests were added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation coupled with the reclassification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to land suitable for the development, so that the Galician firm Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term, could build 4,000 houses there.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but are charged in summary proceedings in the court of the first instance of Totana.
The six first arrested were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the previous mayor of Totany and today a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is under investigation.
He was also charged with his ex-wife, a real estate agent registered today in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigrán (Ponttevedra Province) and Pablo José M. G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and through which bribes were handed out.
The investigation is carried out by the Crime Group under the Construction of the Operational Central Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members carried out, in addition to the arrest, also carried out eleven searches, mostly in companies related to those arrested, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedře, Las Rozas (province Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, in the area of a very well-known owner of a poultry meat product company who could serve as a broker.
The Nuaria Group was tasked with the status of the largest residential complex in the Murcij city of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two "spa" hotels.
The company received 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was reclassified and its project was to double the settlement of the municipality, which has a population of 25,000.
Nuaria is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to promoting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coruňa, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico in the city of Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this commentary from yesterday's edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (incidentally, at the start of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers ran on November 18, on the same day that, coincidentally, a critique of Blackburn's book appeared there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has infiltrated public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the Jokela school.
The victim's assassin, a high school student, quoted Plato and Nietzsche's work in his messages.
Pekka E, the councillor for the education under the subject of philosophy, demanded on the website of Helsingin Sanomat that the professors take a critical stand on Platoon, arguing that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic philosophy course in secondary schools."

One colleague reports on the introduction of the offence of downloading from the Internet to the Penal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime with a rate of six months to one year.
By contrast, if you dispose of a board in a shop at a price of less than €400, this is considered a mere offence (Section 623.1).
B. If you steal up to €1,000 in a shop, the theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for the withdrawal (Section 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than for the download (§ 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a brawl than the shifts of the compacts.
Participating in the riot has a rate of between three months and one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the replacement of compacts would be a rate of between six months and two years
(§ 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than the download of a film on DVD, according to Section 184.2 of the Code.
F. The unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is more often punishable than the provision of pornographic material to minors (Section 186).
So if my colleague is right, someone's hand got away, and that's a good one.

My attending physician is sticking out one of his articles about strange research, "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Or the feelings generated by the monthly paycheck of employees depend on how much the colleague earns.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using MRI resonance at the CAT scan and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the Life&Brain Institute's depiction of the neurocognition group: "The biggest activation was when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
Researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was modest, but when one got double that, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Applicant for the Balkans
The Carla del Ponte has been ruthlessly persecuting the Balkan war criminals of the State Attorney's Court of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings, as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre that killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list from which the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach's documentary film "The Karlin List"(2006) in Spain) was taken over, which follows the work of a Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York in the pursuit of fugitive criminals and pressure the states to draw the network.
What insurance is appropriate for me?
Insurance of a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a considerable expense that depends on various factors such as age, status, gender, driving licence time, type of vehicle to be insured or used, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing suitable car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, you need to be clarified what we're talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This commitment takes the form of an insurance contract stipulating that the insurance undertaking will receive an agreed insured amount of a certain amount for taking responsibility for paying damages in the event of an insurance claim.
The insurance premium is the cost of the insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, the type of vehicle that is insured or used, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of the statistics, so the more likely an accident is to occur, the higher the premium rate.
For this reason, both those over 25 and women must pay lower premiums, as the statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of the inspections, the insurance companies concluded that those living in the marriage tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of the journeys and thus the likelihood of having an accident.
The rise in the frequency of rides increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies are considering when setting the cost of premiums.
Therefore, the driver must study the situation well to choose the kind of insurance that best matches his policymaker's profile.
We will show the most important variables for the selection of one type of insurance here, which, in addition to the fact that they meet the type of insured person, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 encounter different draws of various disadvantages, such as little experience in driving and short possession of a driving licence when they want to take out premiums at an affordable price.
Although ideal for good cover is insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks at a discount premium to obtain the insurance coverage of all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume a client's contribution to the insurance claim.
"Part of the payment of the insurance claim that the client will be provided in advance when determining the price of the premiums, which will be all the higher as the co-payment would be, explains Luis Noguera, First Europe's senior manager in Spain, an internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other traffic participants by the client insuring against the damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five years old, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as possible, as this will affect your bonus and make it possible to reduce premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate held by the insurance company.
By contrast, malus is an increase in that basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the twenty-five-year mark, it is easier for drivers to take out insurance, as the client's risk index is lowered, thanks to their acquired experience.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all risks at a discount.
"Young people are usually unable to take advantage of the experience gained in advance when the crash is made, nor in the driving process," assures the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most of the crashes occur in the second year of proceedings, when the "fear of a newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to take out insurance against all risks, if his economic situation so permits.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies to be a clientele with the lowest risk index and thus their surpluses will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks at the discount of the premium (which could be €300) or at a high premium, insurance extended to other operators, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their driving is calmer and their purchaseability is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount," notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to be insured against all risks with a premium discount (which is €150) or insurance extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It has to be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a valid reason to study the possibilities of insurance that would suit us best in view of our personal personal situation.
Celtic try to earn a point at AC Milan that marks the last eight
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strengths this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an attempt to score a point they lack to achieve their respective goals at the end of the "Champions" league, as it would mean to be the first for the Italians and it would decide the place for the Scots.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured promotion in their fifth game of the draw in Portugal, while Celtic have nine points, but need one more to be sure that Shahhtar will not get ahead of him with the six points, who will play Benfika, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth round is over, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will make their first consecutive consecutive semi-final, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played on the 16th.
So this group will be closed before the others and the tie-riding result at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, although both teams will try to compete for the victory, as the Italians will not want to move on home soil and Celtic know that after the win he would be the first and provide a better place in the last eight.
The Gordon Strachan team could even be able to advance by losing if Shakhtar does not win, but he cannot rely on that, because with the same nine points, the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow (2-1), will advance to the first straight game (2-0).
And so the AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who are confident of reaching the semi-finals in the reorganised Champions League for the second time just as they were beaten in the same match in last year's match by Kaká's goal in extra time (1-0) after 0-0 in the regular season.
Hope to win the "rossoneri" will be Shakhtar, for whom it is worth winning only if Celtic lost, both to advance to the last eight and to stay in UEFA.
Benfica, although the last and does not have the chance to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert as part of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver (Canada) in front of 20,000 spectators since they split in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sports Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before opening their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, they said that the reunion of their group was "great."
About 20,000 people bought out tickets to be present at a concert that also included a video that depicts the history of the group, which drew a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour take place at the same time as a new album, which is released in Spain by EMI, which brings a selection of their main successful tracks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets given to them by the husband "Posh Spice," British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though the nervous Victoria banned him from it a few days earlier.
Prior to the start of the show, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that he "didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what she thinks of the show."
"Sportsy Spice," whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the contradictions between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed its nervousness in meeting with the press two hours before the start of the performance.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the view of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought, why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the reunification of the group she had disbanded nine years earlier.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been settled and we love each other very much."
However, a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver on the Virgin Airlines special.
On arrival, the army of nannies was expecting them at the airport.
The five have a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (on December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He will perform in Madrid on 23 December.
Fears of a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A dispute over the prices of natural gas is currently underway between Russia and Ukraine, and so the risk of Russian supplying this fuel to Western Europe is increasing.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is driven by pipeline through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is being closely watched.
Kiev warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two was reduced by supplies to EU countries last year.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia's state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, seek to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more, as it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its deliveries from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister of Economy Kinach told Reuters.
"Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The latest major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused an overwhelming fall in exports to Western Europe, which has soared to increase prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of deliveries to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but a large proportion of them remain underused.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
The NHS 'must control overseas employees'
The insurer said the Scottish NHS chambers must improve the control of criminal records for non-European staff.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no exact picture of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report emphasized that the other key checks were done in order for a sample of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Audit Office was of interest to the staff obtained from outside the European Economic Area in the country outside the European Economic Area in the morning after the attacks on Glasgow Airport in June.
Twenty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Central Criminal Court using video character accused of links to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS chambers are expected to check with foreign staff in terms of qualifications, experience and authorization for working in the UK before their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to check on criminal records, the agency has no power to obtain such information outside of Britain.
A report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations that the commissions should be run by the Criminal Records Bureau guidelines, which help employers with inspections in several countries.
"Although we have found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, it is not carried out regularly," the report reported.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish NHS agrees in many ways with its own pre-employee veto policy, but also added: "Our report highlights the areas in which the system could be improved to ensure the availability of accurate information about the amount of foreign staff."
President of BMA Scotland dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" to identify the pre-employee inspections of potential NHS employees who might commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employee checks at the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what the additional value of the comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities reported that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these figures would probably be higher, too, because the boards had trouble identifying staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the procedures for inspections in the NHS authorities in the regions of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the policy and pre-employee inspection guidelines for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It also added that the Scottish Government, in line with the health bogs, would consider the recommendations of the report and would ensure that the best practices were presented in the up-to-date directives of pre-employee inspections of all staff - including the foreign one - planned to be issued next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has racked up five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Film Awards.
The awards were also won by star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse, director Anton Corbijn and in the supporting role of Toby Kebell, until the role of Curtis.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller Notes of Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety Award for receiving a British film on the world stage.
The awards were ceremonially presented at Roundhouse, London.
Control describes Curtis's journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - the soundtrack of which includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - cost just £3 million.
But it won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two prizes - for best director and best debuting director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning - as the film by Julien Templ about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the Best Documentary Award.
The Plack for Best Actor was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of the Russian mob boss in the London thriller David Croenberg Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation based on the roles of hard men, won the Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to British film.
This 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is filming another episode of Indiana Jones - the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of the award, which is named after the star of the films Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
The Independent Film Awards, known as Bify, are given by a jury featuring filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
Supporters and patrons of the Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for their membership in cells preparing an imminent attack on the oil facility, as well as on the clerks and security forces.
State broadcaster, the largest oil exporter, said one of the cells wanted to smuggle rockets into the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, allies of the United States, since 2003, since the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner had planned to attack an oil-style oil plant in Ash-Sharqiyah Province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000 rapid response unit to defend the facility since al-Qaeda's failed attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in the Abqaiq in 2006.
The story quoted the ministry's internal statement: 18 of those arrested were among the cell led by a "missile launch expert" that slipped into the country.
She also said that the militants had planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
The 22 detainees were to prepare the murders of clergy and security personnel.
The government urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from leaving for Iraq to join the al-Qaeda militants fighting allied troops and the US-backed Shiite government, which the conservative Sunni Saudis consider he heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of al-Qaeda leader Saud Osama bin Laden to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - have focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and power equipment.
"This war has been a tremendous effort by the security forces in the past... five months," an internal ministry spokesman told state television.
Also arrested was a 16-member "media cell" in Medina, which aimed to promote "Ssuch as the Islamic thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as unbelievers and renegades.
Among those arrested were also 32 people accused of providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus is perhaps a look at the future of the Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus might once have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the orbiting European station shows that the planet is even more similar to the willful twin of the Earth than previously thought.
Venus is Earth's next planetary neighbor.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbiting similar pathways, but Venus is a little closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions were similar to those on Earth on Venus and could be habitable.
But the runaway greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and the lower rate of rotation were sent to Venus after a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is water-free, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and it's ravaged by storms and hurricane-force winds.
Findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sharper glimpse of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford physics department and one of the Venus Express mission leaders said: "It is becoming clearer why the climate on Venus is so different from Earth, even if the planets themselves are otherwise quite similar.
"Our new data allows the compilation of a scenario in which Venus, like Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police detain "enriched uranium"
A block of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained by Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but he said the substance could be sold for $1 million (£480,000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it was not dignified for the presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates eventually agreed to a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters uploaded their questions to the video and forwarded them to the candidates for broadcasters.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday, November 28, were as comical as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the other side's YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot about the Republican Party's state of affairs leading up to next year's election.
It is unclear exactly how the CNN producers, one of the debopus sponsors, selected clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This theme is one of the most powerful Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the puck around when they heard something gratifying: the announcer noted the peaks of approval when the candidates talked about a hard-line approach at the border.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr Romney, who poke forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake off the reputation of a man who, as Mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two struggled particularly fiercely when questioners asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Secondary candidates, like Duncan Hunter, the California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, the Colorado congressman, managed to throw their little on the subject.
None of the two have a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game for perhaps starting to sound the alarm about immigration earlier and more strongly than the others.
At least for immigration, the candidates have roughly the same view: greater severity at the border, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This issue, coupled with fears of poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimise the contradiction between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani has been asked why he has supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the technique of simulated heating should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed in every word from the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani stumbled through it to the view that even though the Bible was his favorite book, he probably didn't believe literally the story of Jonah and the Whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all odds in the first place in a recent Iowa poll thanks to his long-term Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning him laughter.
The contest remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with recent successes in raising money and the loud cheerfulness of Ron Paul at Wednesday's debate.
These two have bounced back because both of the party's wings still cannot agree on more well-known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with the winning news about American Size on the lips, winking at both wingers of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from definite.
Paints of the Labour
Once again, Gordon Brown found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
There don't seem to be any orders sold, no accounts at the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extramarital little fingers were sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown could do without being discovered that a wealthy businessman had masked contributions from the ruling Labour Party for four years under the names of other people, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling for the election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision had not been influenced by the polls, there was hope of a resilient and effective government.
Instead of being formulated by the increasingly hilarious deputy chairman of the Liberal Democrats, the once-gared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The ill-privileged rescue of the troubled Northern Rock bank showed weaknesses in the proceedings and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend the tax code brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data to 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative bungling.
The retired three generals set off a revolt in the Lords' House; they protested against the cuts in military spending, claiming that being commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are multi-shaped gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of Labour (and their former internal discipline watchdog), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inexorably heading to his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the tip of the flipping point, for which they find it difficult to govern.
People don't trust politicians and dislike them, but they usually push back their distrust when a new bunch takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, nor may he be in office for long, this is a relegation gone: the civil service is becoming leaky, ministers start to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one way, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, as it cannot take the position of a new broom compared to other political leaders.
As much as he would like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the IRS are linked to the decisions that Mr Brown made as finance minister.
And while he was not directly involved in Bórov's troubles, such as the long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "condematures for money," voters may well conclude that he was.
Still, Mr Brown's predicament is not as bad as they seem.
The miscalculation isn't as gruesome as the Conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was downright deceived.
And the treatment, as painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm, and slightly brutal government.
The latest uproar over political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to a charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of the big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who might buy access to those who govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr Abrahams's progress, but did not know that he was illegal, would surely be thoroughly interrogated; so would Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money-seeker who had learned of the tricky gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved yet; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these plots, although the bulk of the payments took place after he took office in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work so far.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but diluted his resolve by reaching for a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - conducted in addition by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, such as finding the permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has had none for six months, and to cede with a real reform of the funding of political parties.
This would require Labour, who are in a bind, to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps to give up their special financial relationship with the unions - the bitter pill for a committed party member like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives are now well ahead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to earn a victory is to unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card sharks
Does the lower-price mortgage crisis affect the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, naturally the dorsal fins start to pass around excitedly.
Now that the US real estate market is withering, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say that credit card losses, if other options for consumer loans were contracted by sub-prime mortgages, could reach $99 billion.
Signs of tension are clear.
There is a growing number of default cases (for more than 30-day payment delays) and written-off accounts (cards that the provider considers to be unenforceable).
HSBC reported last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in the US consumer credit market - also because of non-solvent credit card loans.
But it is too early to panic.
The accounts of the written off and the inability to repay are still scarce.
According to the Moody's rating agency, the 3.89% default rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below the average.
Deteriorating measurements can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The 2005 change in the US Personal Bankruptcy Act led to a sharp drop in the number of reported bankruptcies, which do a large proportion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of depreciation depreciation) would therefore rise, regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers worsened.
The industry also shows a good maturity rate that shows how much consumers will repay from their debts on a monthly basis.
And trust in the securities of secured credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of the structured finance sector.
Mr Dennis Moroney of the research firm TowerGroup predicts that their emissions volumes for 2007 will be 25% larger than last year.
Direct routes to spread infection between the lower-price mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: when loans are dries up on property worth, consumers are more likely to go into debt through credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, look more at the cash flow than the value of the guarantor items, so the falling prices of houses do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They may even be advantageous for the lenders.
Consumer mortgage incentives for mortgage payments fall when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, card debt is moved upwards to the list of priorities for repayment.
Card issuers can also respond more quickly and flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage lenders by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of a rapid change in the price of guarantor items.
"It's not going to happen that we're just rethinking all the loans on a beautiful morning," says Gary Perlin, a financial director at Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of inferior mortgages is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower house prices and debt-reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for the dorsal fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud associated with former Enron financial manager Andrew Fastow changed their testimony on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby, and Gary Mulgrew had initially pleaded guilty on seven fraud charges against fraud, together with Fastow, participating in financial fraud in 2000 -- to enrich themselves on behalf of their employers -- denied.
They were due in court in January.
However, during a court appearance before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each pleaded guilty to a fraud.
The case of these three former executives at Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was on the front pages for the two full years, which was taken to issue.
In the United States, their case is one of the unfinished parts of an investigation into the begun after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The accusations against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that the government's investigation into the collapse of Enron had been the target of the government.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Three" -- claims to have come to Houston in 2000 to plot the deception with Fastow and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partner affiliate, controlled by Fastow, which was the architect of a multitude of enron scams that pushed Enron through the spasm of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank valued its stake in this branch with a zero, but our three Britons knew it was in fact of considerable value.
Under Kopper's control, the company bought the bank's stake in that branch for $1 million.
The incriminating bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow bluntly informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in that branch of Greenwich NatWest.
But the 20 million was actually the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, according to the indictment, and Fastow, Kopper, and others were up by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty in two instances of conspiracy to play in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at the Louisiana Federal Penitentiary.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were on the loose on bail of $1 million, ordering them to remain in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country's seventh-largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions in debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse cut back thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market values and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former senior senior executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted of their role in the company's downfall last year.
Skilling is in the execution of a more than 24-year sentence.
Judgments over Laya for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-helmnost
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and a sufficient fuel volume for nonstop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is the change for returning.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in that many jobs because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat in the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the Millionaire Exhibition, a four-day orgy of spectacular consumerism in the mammoth exhibition centre on the outdeep of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury suppliers built their stalls, hoping that the newly-naked Russians would lure the newly-naked Russians to everything from mahagon-inhit yachts to diamond-embodled car counters that would not be ashamed of even 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer looked carefully for the bright orange Porsche in the next stand.
"That's a nice car, but against us it's the dents and dimes," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
Money floats on oil waves to the Russian capital just as much as Dallas had its days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got immensely rich and marched to Europe, where they were viewed as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi spendthrials of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are becoming the world's most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share on this Clump.
At another location in Moscow this week, the luxury industry conference of Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH group, was attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell expensive goods at markets like the Russian one.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company.
Russia, according to the list of the richest people, has 53 billionaires with a total change of $282 billion.
In addition, the local main institute in the Center for Economic Research has issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-marrow" millionaires in Russia, with a total of $670 billion in assets.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of the London jewelry store, David Morris.
It was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are impeccably groomed, and the men are all for a fortune."
As they walked in the evening dresses on Sunday night with the halls, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova, and Svetlana Turovcov, five years her senior, described herself and her clients as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who was wrapped in designer clothes like a red carpet veteran next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a home-grown puťka.
The fair seemed to be focused primarily on the fresh upstarts, branded Russian shoppers who are willing to sit out for a few hours in the road to get a walk around the warehouse, which is glaringly mixed by Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, combed-to-measure, apartments in Dubai, Gund and draughts.
Members of the ordinary public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57.
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stall of the Dutch porcelain porcelain producer Royal Delft before the reproduction of the Rembrandt painting from hand-painted blue tiles in size.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in the facade."
Indeed, the shopkeepers here say that the Russians with the old money (according to the Russian standards are 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from the glittering logos to the little-known brands of limited-editioned editions that would never have been shown at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires' ambassadors, or simple tourists, flooded the fair halls day after day.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed, said he had sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, laced with gold threads, after $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of the A1 Moto, said that equips high-end cars with high-end alarms that his company sold the bright orange Porsche for $17,70,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, which, on request, is editing luxury cars, that he sold three bars to cars in the style of connected chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms at 55,000 dollars.
He showed the reporter a car's bicycle designed for the casino's Russian owner, which had a haft coated with Swarovsky crystals to look like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of those.
"The Russian millionaire who wants lacerer wheels or a portrait of his cubic wife from a cubic zirconium doesn't have to ride on those bikes yet," Mr. Karapetian said.
"They'll put them in their garage of thirty to forty cars."
While many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" at the moment was not much exclusive, given the large increase in the prices of local properties.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least feign wealth at a stand run by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which is active in asset management.
The company erected four red British-style phone booths stuffed with a column of fake banknotes worth a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said his team had printed out 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires' Trade Fair.
Passersby stopped to throw around a pile of money, or to be photographed by their friends on their cell phone, relaxing in the middle of a spare wealth, or simply paddling a few million pockets.
"You know, in Moscow, anyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey possibly caused by corrupt surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the O restaurant a little more healthily and watched an ambulance that had come to a white New England house two houses below West Scott Avenue.
Soon, a police patrol car joined in.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical examiner's delivery arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, the executive assistant to the director of the NewsaMar Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if she died of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon, whose identity the police have refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to determine what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that the toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness to the leadership of the NewGarian police.
Ms. Arroy was assistant to the Chief Constable, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough, and worked hard," Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroy in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would have protected me.'
Mr McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newryan police officer who works for the Alcohol Drinks Commission, and that she left behind two sons at the age of 14 and 11 and her stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the State Attorney of the District of the Union, Theodora J. Romankowa, said detectives were trying to determine if Miss Arroyo had died from an unlicensed surgical operation.
"It's one possibility," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m.
November and found Miss Arroy on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities said little of their investigation or the homeowner, which is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh did not say if the authorities interviewed Miss Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday at Miss Castro's house, with a damaged pink bush in the front yard and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" was on the floor in the open garage - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
On the hooks on one side hung two mountain bikes.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York City Police Department for the New York City Police Department, Ms. Arroyo had given him invaluable help to chew through the intolerable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You'd better watch out for this or this,'" he said.
"She'd always be here when I came in, and she'd always be here when I left.
It was embarrassing.'
Hopes that Fed cut interest rates leads to boost world stock exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market's hopes of the Federal Bank trying to calm lending conditions by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by the reassuring remarks of the Vice-President of the US Federal Reserve.
The stock markets jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line behind Ben Bernanko, the Fed chairman, said that responding to continued pressure in the financial markets, the governing factors must be "flexible and pragmatic."
As a result of the apparent attempt to reassure the exasperated markets amid indications of a rushing credit effort, Mr Kohn said that the recent excitement "partially reversed some improvements in the functioning of the markets towards the end of September and in October."
He also said that if the increased instability persists, the possibility of the financial conditions of households and companies deteriorating further will increase.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver more fresh capital benefits to US markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts, to stabilise credit terms.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid more bad news about the US economy, with housing sales reporting at a record low in October.
The consequences of financial swine were underlined by the announcement by the investment bank Bear Stearns to cut 650 jobs, 4% of its world's workforce, in order to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the failed bet on providing inferior home loans in America.
Only 20 of these posts are expected to be cancelled in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones grew to be 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more used S&P 500 rose 2.65 percent.
London's FTSE 100 rose 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than £39bn.
Germany's Dax index rose 2.6 percent, with France's CAC40 up 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets proved to be in full force after the auction of the European Central Bank's three-month cash packets were lent to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the English Bank to be followed by the Fed and the ECB and launch above-standard money on London's money markets has been increased, with the rates of three-month British interbanking loans "Libor" rising to their best since the end of September - 6.59 per cent after uninterrupted growth since November 12th - 6.59 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who will be number six at bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who has to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, chairman of the committee's collector, who holds the post at best in the borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, the recruitment decision-making, and as Hugh Morris's desk, the England team's chief executive, begins to fill with applications for the post of national collector, albeit not necessarily full-time.
Whoever is not put on the bat at the sixth place at bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and the sport is no longer fair.
It is not easy to find what one gets to the top of his profession, while someone else never gets past the lower level, sometimes due to lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket that the selection is challenging and requires an opinion that in the end always has to be subjective.
Is it right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah if he is?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and an overview of the field, should be promoted to the commission - a place is only for one.
Who is to say which level is right for cricketers if you can't take a chance to drop or swim to the next one?
Naturally, the numbers have a big impact on decision-making, but so do the opportunities.
In the team, a cricketaker must at the right time catch the captain's view of whether to take the wicket, and the batter needs regular chances in starting positions if he should ever make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the collector's view is more complicated.
For example, last season there were many better things that James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison said himself to be healthy and pitched as a gunner.
Anderson took 32 wickets in first class at 33 skirts to each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same meagre average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for more.
Whether he plays at the Asgiriya Shah stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
Choice can start or reach the careers of both, or it may not have much of an impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and performed well, five wickets and 40 consecutive passes in the first grade in Sri Lanka, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was struggling for his job at the same time, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer who is in addition to being twice a hundred points in Australia against Australia, perhaps still underrated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion in the wake of today's training session at the Asirgiya Stadium, will be followed by their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience to Bopar's youthful buoyancy.
There are arguments for both of them.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test shifts speak at 88 points in Mumbai and 3200 in the first class, compared to the six Bopar, who is, at 22, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin pitches.
However, in two shifts against the Caribbean in May against the Caribbean in Test at Lord's, his home ground in Middlesex, made only ten runs, along with the immediate rejection of the selectors, when Vaughan wanted to reapit him for the next game, his launch seems to have taken away some of the vigor that was so evident in Bombay.
In contrast, the Espsex All-Star has joie de vivre in its bones.
Nothing will startle him on the cricket field, and his out-of-the-field behavior symbolizes a recently overturned four-wheel-drive car on the exhibition day of the English team's car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and probably shock, but the first thing he pulled out of his Vodafone (also sponsored, of course) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate, who watched from a distance from the distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his mid-fast shear pitching on the local playgrounds, which seem to suit him, gives away effectively and batches with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'm inclined to get Bopara's chance now, which I'm not saying I'm not going to say Shah won't be excelling if, as the Ceylon tea leaves suggest, it's he who's going to play here next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight against al-Qaida
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria started arriving in Baghdad yesterday, pouring out of the money or the visa period, and others hoping to return to a normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who had driven them from their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubai, a Sunni doctor.
"Today I came back because of what I saw on TV and what I read about in the newspapers because of what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shia militant militant Muqtad al-Sadra militant militant, who temporarily ordered his people to abort the fight.
Kassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amaria, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaria called in, saying that the local militia, with the support of the U.S. military, helped push al-Qaida out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was driven out of his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad, by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"The day before yesterday, a few friends called me and told me that he was launching a militia against al-Qaida in Sleikh, and that he needed me and that he needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, said.
Many spoke of the attraction of reassurance in the capital, following the strengthening of the US military presence and the growth of local "groups of prejudiced citizens" who, with a gun in hand, defending their neighborhoods with a gun in their hand.
But there was more talk that they were prompted to return by obstruction around visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced the suspicion shared among the refugees that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and to make them return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled Iraqi sectarian killers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving visas to the Iraqis to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
The partial reason for weakening the violence is that Sunnis were forced out of the Shiite regions and vice versa, which reduces tensions in many places.
There are fears that the sudden flow of refugees will once again fuel sectarian tensions and lead to another fight.
Tiny Saronia, good education
The smallest federal state of Germany plays a leading role in vocational training, excelling even by the international focus of its universities.
Only in one educational field is Sara's concern the same shortcomings as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Saarland, I explained yesterday for the fiftieth time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears in Saarland on the 50th anniversary of the birthday of this smallest federal state.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Sariarian education system, which is in fifth place in the monitoring of the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
As a result, the universities have traditionally co-operated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple degree.
What corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above-average number of Sai's children are admitted to a college - many of them without studying at the grammar school.
"A professional education system is being used in Sársko," says Axel Plünnecke, IW's educational expert.
By obtaining a licence to study in a vocational school more than one in five juveniles, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities to combine practical and academic education in Sara.
The opportunities to study two disciplines are the second best in the whole of Germany, given the population.
Despite virtually-oriented training and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Sarsai Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for the engineering sector.
"After the first study by Pisa, we have carried out several reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
To start learning as soon as possible, the last year of the nursery school is a free one - a model taken over by other Länder.
If the pupils' results improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
In conducting a study by the Pisa in 2003, the proportion of at-risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20%.
In total, however, Sársko has not improved by as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are better at counting.
And to the disappointment of the Sara, the Pisa study does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sara could score in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in grammar schools - even if the people of Sársko are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
The hours in Venezuela will soon go differently from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will take the clock in this South American country back half an hour.
In Spain, meanwhile, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figurehead.
Venezuela's official paper reported that the clock would move up by minus four and a half hours under the new law compared to world time.
The South American state will take this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the US, justified his decision by, among other things, by imposing the world on the division of time zones throughout the hours.
In addition, on Wednesday, local time, Chavéz announced that he was severing relations with neighboring Colombia over the hostage case.
This left-wing nationalist has said that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or the Colombian government.
"I can't help but for my self-esteem," said Chávez, who is pushing for the reform of the constitution that the citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Chávez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The argument was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of the hostages.
Uribe's decision to "spit in the face," Uribe Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone talks about Chávez.
The new mobile ringtone has caused a stir here: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you already quiet?) - that's the line that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the internet.
It was made out by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was so upset by the resounding appeals at the recent Ibero-American Summit by this left-wing populists to silence him in this way.
Germans face lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of lowering their real wages this year despite a strong boom.
Experts justified their pessimistic forecast with a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007, employed people can realistically expect to receive a lower wage than last year.
"The blame for the small salary increase, the increase in value added tax and the increase in food and energy prices are to be made," Gustav Horn of the IMK Research Institute (Institut für Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung) told Bild.
New charges on staff may also be in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% was correct and sensible in this situation.
However, the Federal Labor Agency would no longer be allowed to fall into such difficulties in order to require loans or contributions from the Federal Maltese, the newspapers of this social democratic politician were quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was disclosed that a price explosion in food and petroleum products drove inflation to its highest level in thirteen years.
Overall, prices rose three percent in the annual comparison.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth
Despite its life's hostile atmosphere, Venus Earth is more similar to what was previously assumed. The European spacecraft Venus Express on Venus recorded phenomena that also appear on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind venues at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it flashes on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has produced evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flourish from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in the science journal Nature.
According to the known theory of the formation of primordial mass, life could have been created on Earth by lightning. The storms reportedly provoked reactions in the oceans that led to the emergence of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
It wasn't the case on Venus: "If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there would be something alive on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"Venwe may be the Hell's twin brother of the Earth, but he's a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which is so much like Earth's mass and its size, has started to develop in a completely different way is a basic question of the mission of the Asshai mission.
Since no probe has been launched since the early 1990s for the sole purpose of studying Venus, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in research on this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which were approached by several articles by the journal's journal, did not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than previously thought," Esa said.
Aside from the already known wind vortices at the North Pole, the scientists found a cloud-based vortex at the South Pole that spins significantly faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the northern hemisphere of the Earth, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Instituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is made up of almost the same matter as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km, it is almost the same size.
This planet, referred to as Morningstar or Evening Star, the Sun or Lentnament will orbit in nearly 225 days.
But it rotates around its own axis much more slowly. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although the Venus with a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar(abbreviation for the bar?) It does not resemble the earth, scientists are based on the fact that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
Both were stockpiled with water. On Earth, however, it remained in the oceans, while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound to Earth in carbonates, it forms the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler is calling for the cessation of party disputes over the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is worried about Germany's reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the feud surrounding the acceptance of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves outwardly as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed sympathy for German Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
The Federal President, while emphasizing that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this has not prevented him from defending Merkel when she was blamed for creating a new policy toward China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a single China.
China knows that, too," Köhler said.
Secretary of State Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly voiced his opposition to the acceptance of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the Coalition for this.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition's "supon-dog" foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's reception in the chancellor's office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to information from SPIEGEGEL, it has also froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve of European politicians officially accepting the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
Words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas also located on the territory of China, is attempting to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest that erupted in France
Street fights with the police, gunfights, torched cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar unrest that erupted in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not escalate into violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior calls for.
Barricades were on fire, rioters shotguns at the police. After the severe riots of juveniles in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also concerned about similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful that we also do not develop the kind of social tension that erupts in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the Neue Presse in the Hanover newspaper.
Not every young person is said to be able to cope with a rapid change of social reality.
The Federal Government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to remedy the problems, Schäuble said.
This does not just mean the integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we have had our first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs were not comparable to those of the French.
Over the past nights, juveniles and police in the northern suburbs of Paris have fought harsh street fighting.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were on fire.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In light of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against an "imitation effect."
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25, the unemployment rate is "above-scale" the unemployment rate.
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of learning opportunities.
Kolat emphasized, "We must give the juveniles hope."
But the president of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike in France, there is greater social control of families.
In addition, many teenagers from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "Yet we have to pay attention."
We need to "really allow the juvenile minors to start working and educate themselves."
Meanwhile, the night remained largely calm in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police officers were in deployment, and a helicopter was flying over the area with headlights.
Authorised authorities reported three arrests and several littered rubbish bins and cars.
Since yesterday, approximately 1,000 deployed law enforcement forces have taken care of the calm.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburbs.
In riots on the outskirts of the outskirts of the outskirts of the Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured overnight on Tuesday.
The following night, the riots of Toulouse engulfed.
The messfire was sparked by Sunday's traffic accident, in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to initial findings from the prosecutor's office, the police are not to blame for the death of juveniles.
In the Reich of Angela, "Citles"
The chancellor's reality of the distant ascent documents that the coalition is programmatically at the end of it, and that we can't expect anything more from it either.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her desolation, indifferently sounding and content-poor appearance at the General Debate's General Debate, we must state: not here - not here - not in this country, which, after all, that she should administer.
The reproach of being too concentrated on foreign policy was once answered by Angela Merkel in a very arrogant phrase.
That's provincial, she said, showing that she didn't want to understand what the critics were up to.
In the Bundestag, she visibly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserved the remorse.
There was no real interest from Merkel, let alone a flair for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela's "Clayer" presented herself: a politician who excels at the others who are fleeing to foreign policy and, even there, expressing herself only vaguely.
Climate protection, for example: it is constantly being praised for the conclusions drawn from the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the climate targets are to be achieved in Germany.
Anyway, such a self-clave - the CDU chairwoman would have forgiven herself as such immodesty two years ago.
It is now confined to idle phrases that could increase its popularity among people.
With this approach, it damages his imij pragmatists, who do not need to be flattered because it solves the problems.
But in the Reich of Angela, "Clouds" are a marginal issue in the internal political problems.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
A few of the secondary sentences on these topics were left.
It is worth noting how often Merkel's child benefit is recited.
Three times Merkel has to start from the start to speak at least in part of the correct sentence.
Once things get too specific, it stumbles like it's in completely foreign terrain.
Department of Attack
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube has sparked a fierce debate in the case of the favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney - and both now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already reflected in the first topic.
Mitt Romney is throwing his opponent, Rudy Guiliani, for making New York a "track for illegal immigrants."
Giuliani quickly responds with sharp remorse: "I believe his own house was just one such refuge," he replies, grooming to former Governor Massachusetts for privately employing undocumented immigrants.
Candidates are on the attack. With the Republican base not yet in clear front-runner, eight presidential candidates are using these CNN debates mainly to discredit their rivals.
The half-minute, internet-based user-made and Youtube-based videos only serve as such clues to the key theme.
"We have allowed Hitler to take power with a policy of isolationism," John McCain pre-empts on his opponent, Ron Paul, the only one advocating for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
The Vietnamese veteran McCain spares no expense for his remorse or Romney, for refusing to denounce the tortured method of interrogation called "Waterboarding," in which the heater is simulated.
Reaction from the audience in St. Petersburg are shown to be that the important topics of the campaign include neither the war in Iraq nor the torture methods.
The audience breaks in applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected.
That'll show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains contritely, asking for the party base and the TV audience's forgiveness for being in favour of abortion as recently as 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed when he is asked to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in plainclothes for the first time
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief of the army, the Pakistani ruler Musharraaf took the presidential oath of office.
That concludes the eight years of military government in Pakistan.
The president of Pakistan, Parvíz Musharraf, took the presidential oath of office on Thursday, remaining in the presidency for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live on a ceremony held at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to honor the Constitution and seek the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to the commander-in-chief of the Army to his confidante, Ashfaq Kiyani, undergoing international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he seized power in a bloodless military coup, the former general reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With the withdrawal from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf met one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the lifting of the state of emergency, which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
According to Chief Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharrah will abolish the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another of the demands of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which took Musharraf after the state of emergency was declared by his sympathetic lawyers at the beginning of November, rejected all objections over the past week to the contested re-election of the head of state 6. October.
Meanwhile, in the attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
A spokesman for the army said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
Fathers of krautrock return
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group re-rapped their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
The Revival will also include the 1974 Live, a cut from the band's most successful period.
They were already considerably better known abroad.
The reported sensation then consists of the performance of three sedate gentlemen, who at first look as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and mainly buttons in front of them.
Sixty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius, in a snow-white shirt, sits in the middle.
To his left is Michael Rother, 57, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
The 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who bows intently over the synthesizers, is on the right from the view of the viewers.
Each contributes sounds, even beats at times.
Sometimes, inadvertently, they will be a traditional piece.
The musicians don't seem to mind much.
Among the lovers of the krautrock, the Turga band's revival caused quite a stir.
One thing here is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that while this name is part of a collective awareness of pop, it is certainly not so established that this band is missed in painfully for twenty-three years.
But why could a German not even celebrate his still-living seventies legends?
And especially when the musical style, mistakenly called the krautrock, in England and in America is valued more than in its own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the Echo Award to the surviving members of the Cologne group, the Echo Award for Life's Work, the hall was full of questioning views from German pop fans.
Moreover, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the astonishment of the viewers was no longer known to the bounds.
Michael Rother later sat on stage with them at the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and adoring abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia, we unnecessarily overload our memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even at the time it was far from the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name of Cluster.
They initially played in the cellar of the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at a gramophone-led church-led-led gramophone company.
Rother briefly helped out for Kraftwerk, but gained a reputation as a guitarist with the band Neu!, which at the time may have been the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the band's musicians into exile at Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of the commune who had fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in the commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed toil like a nanny.
It was more like life in such a Spitzwegov artistic being.
The name for the art is reportedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the garbage can.
Much of this has been preserved by Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music by Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Collecting the bricks was not just self-recognized.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" is said to have been edited at a concert in Griesse before a record-breaking, barely 50-strong backdrop.
Roth had then expressed his desire for the members of the Harmony to get excited and practiced occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebio, this was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and insured his future with the album "The Burning Heart."
The band Cluster came back to life in the 1980s and has been more successful ever since before, and it has been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His record firm, Grönland, took the goal of cherishing the krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was at that time considered Roedelio's solo work.
The Heat Resurrection of Harmonie will take place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
Present will be the Brit, Julian Cope, the old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" handbook.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motto.
This outlined the overall breadth of the Krautrock's influence on future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence accompanied by the most harsh sounds float in the hall: "Unique real music, it's the future."
There are paintings on which the producer with Harmony is in the peasant's seat.
The creation of the legend is also helped by the projection of other black-and-white photographs on which the set of instruments are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are once again employed by improvisation.
No longer gluing the microphones to the organ and drums to extract the previously unheard-of samlés tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technique of immersed metallic.
This is not changed by the congregation of the House of World Cultures.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, word is whispered under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place, the "Aaaaaaaaaaaaa!" is emfatically sung in a beautiful place.
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
Rather than in the blues, we would find the roots in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the flight from art and social conventions (Cluster).
He who exclaims "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but even now, Harmonia will not be taken out of her peace.
Even the most obvious is thought through on the scene.
Where does the music begin and when does it end?
This question either takes a person's nerve or allows him to experience the passing of the ephemeral moments of happiness.
Richard Gere just isn't cynical enough
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, there were two films about the war in the Balkans.
But neither of them is convincing.
The film's draft either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they're too moving.
This will not be prevented at The Hunting Party by an actor like Richard Gere.
The good news first: War criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is there, in the gloomy background of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere finds himself.
We've lost sight of this most beautiful man in the '80s lately, not only because he's starred in many pleasing, unhigh-shaped roles in cool women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on Buddhism, they take away an appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for seeing The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become prey (Why must the names of the films be so long and entangled these days?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter, Simon Hunt, is essentially who Gere might have become if fate and the film business weren't so merciful: a man who, while well past his best years, but still retains a remarkable charm as ruins like the conrashes.
But despite this trump card, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also hits cinemas this week, is just by continuing an endless series of unsuccessful films about the Balkans war.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden, we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescues a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, whereupon one of them falls in love with her.
While it is commendable that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this TV shallow film is changing too soon in shooting and action.
The film will leave something very similar to the series Cobru 11, without a highway, but for that with the war.
The Hunting Party shows you to be just illustrated why a really good movie has not yet been made about the Balkan War.
The story of three American war reporters who follow the "drumb," the Serbian Chief War Criminal, could possibly be a new "Accab for" "Accabwriter" in another time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (Brong Shepard, both of them).
After all, the two stories are surprisingly similar: the small groups go into the forest to do something the army is incapable of doing, but their journey will become a madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the debauched and sentimental cynic introduced at the start.
On the contrary, the draft will also prescribe a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can be finally written off after reporters in the last five quickened minutes of the film will do what NATO, the CIA and all the world's hunters have failed to capture criminals in the last five years, and leave him the righteous revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of film-making that it would be worth going to the International Court in The Hague.
Yet this film has a deeply human message.
He condemns that Karadzić and Mladić are still at large, and suspecting the Americans and the French (this is an exceptionally united here) that they are not committed to persecution quite intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, the famous Brecht poem invites us to marry.
It's about the Asian demon's wooden mask on the writer's desk: "I look at the swolen veins on my forehead with compassion, commenting: how ardent it is to be evil."
In films like The Hunting Party, there are exactly the kind of swollen heads that suggest how ardent it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
It was recently written in this newspaper that all Hollywood's films about Iraq were major failures.
There is only one thing to add: No good film about South Africa has ever been made before.
Almost always: When a star hangs around the crisis area or walks around a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Angelina Jolie's Boundary with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamantanten with Leonardo DiCaprio is made.
Maybe all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it took decades to go before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust film - the Schindler's List.
Many of the film must probably mature - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Lunch of the Deer," "Apocalypse" or "The Lead Vest" - were by no means hailed as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home appears on two screens right away, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
The writers then do not have the ability that is needed to deliver good stories flawlessly.
After all, "to be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" had become so good, for Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how horribly the Nazi regime had actually ruled.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he must form a sarcastically awardly aloof artistic view like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel, "Lemprière's Dictionary" and "The Balcany War," he said: "The ever-opathly is that some things never change.
Greater cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beuste for Councillor Telling the Olympics
The mayor's withdrawal from hosting the Hamburg Summer Olympics has come up against fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the game layout by the water.
But Von Beusts is urging realism in estimating the chances.
The chief executive of the chambers of commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called the decision "unfortunate in terms of business."
No other project has recently woken up as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, this sporting political enthusiasm could not be kept to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to float the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "which is based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with his earlier statements, according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Association will decide on the Munich bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means to us that we have no realistic chance of a realistic chance with the 2028 timetable."
Yet this dream is not yet over, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Union (HSB) called von Beusto's remarks regrettable.
He is under the impression that Hamburg does not want to compete for the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too early to destroy our chances of calling the plans buried at this early stage," the president of HSB, Günter Ploss, said on Wednesday.
The renims of the run-in would be contrary to the testimony of the head of the Senate, which he made at the general meeting of the General German University Sports Association.
Von Beust here did not report Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 University as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
The University Sports Association Hamburg has only nominated for the candidate city in the past week.
The SPD faction in the Senate's Hamburg parliament has criticised the fact that it is wasting valuable time that could be used to build flats in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook region was held back by the Senate for years because it bet on the organisation of the Olympics and excluded the construction of the flats," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook region was still planning the Olympics, with the entire area later being used for home-gone, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor."
The run-up to the 2012 Summer Olympics drew great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, crashed on Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Whoever combines the terms of Sweden and the wooden crates doesn't think of Andy Warhol, but on Ikea.
Or is it?
Wooden crates produced in Sweden currently cast dark shadows on the list of Warhol's works.
Most of his list of the ninety-four "Brill Boxes" of the Stockholm type are falsifications.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" expressed doubts about the authenticity of the Warhols's "Brillo Boxes" of 1968, the internal research of the Museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm comes with a result that brought about disillusionment; the six "Brillo Boxes" which were donated by its former director, Pontus Hultén, in a gift from the Moderna Museum in 1995, are copies - as are most of the other "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type, which are in circulation on the international art market.
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of art and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden crates that were based on the reddish-dry design of the paper boxes of Brillo's soapy powder.
The exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 performed - with Warhol's approval - hundreds of Brillo crates of a carton. These were not (for financial reasons) by Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
These were not works of art, but their originals, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo crates in Sweden, but these are not on display at Moderna Museet.
The witnesses at the time now speak of the fifteen crates that rightly entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that in 1968 it was made and exhibited in Sweden with around a hundred boxes, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hultén's crates were made in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By then, Warhol was three dead.
In addition to the six Brillo booths owned by the museum, Lars Byström, the top Conservator Moderna Museet, explored three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and, after their plywood boards were painted in the base and rim, were colored with oil white.
On the contrary, it emerged from the 1990 copy structure that the colour was applied to the coating without a previous basic coating directly to the plywood plate - besides, it is an acrylic and not an oleic colour.
"These crates were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo Boxing list," said the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six rafts from his exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copies"."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would look into these "frightened accusations" that had been filed in the matter of soapy powder boxes.
But the organization is still inexorable silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered to the renunciation of a hotel in Manila demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Rebels commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers dedicated to the government had previously attacked the hotel with the use of tear gas.
Hours before that, about two dozen soldiers had been fortified in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood trial for a thwarted coup attempt in 2003, including the Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to flee with his 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who were supposed to be guarding him apparently defected to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government's loyal forces closed the area around the hotel's selected.
The president called an emergency session of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said other military units would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for major demonstrations to take place against the president on Friday.
For months, her government has been blamed for corruption.
The Manila financial area had already become the main scene of the rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroyo in 2003.
As the rebels were refused to join the army, the rebellion failed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, they have attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government in the Philippines at least seven times.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured a more than 20 percent stake in the telecoms firm Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share was 14.46 euros.
The company is now said to own 20.05% of the share capital.
There had been speculation about the takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is moving to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator by a further 5 % to a further 5 % to 15.1%, an entry-in-command conjecture emerged on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this financial institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet, at Drillisch, a mobile telecoms provider, had a share of nearly 10% at Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications network.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch put another 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million for sale.
Of this, 5.15 million shares were purchased by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing co-operation in DSL and mobile network products.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman explained.
In order to take over Freenet, the companies jointly established a joint venture between SMEs.
United Internet announced on Thursday that both companies would be comfortable with a share of more than 10% in Freenet for the time being and would not use their right to take over an additional 18.49% of the business.
The companies are considered to have kept all options open for the time being, in particular the possibility of further increasing their stake in Freenet AG.
The United Internet and Freenet interviews on the strategic partnership were terminated in mid-November.
This months-long and hard-to-rehand game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile network contract customers at the end of the third quarter and 1.27 million customers with complete or DSL connections.
Holding United Internet and Drillische still held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It is now said to have been agreed that Drillisch would get around 4% more.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
