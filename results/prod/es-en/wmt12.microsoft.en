Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
Ukraine's Parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the criminal code section condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the release of the former prime minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes at second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia that was disadvantageous to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet final, the appellate court has an obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political vendetta of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Penal Code condemning the former prime minister was supported by 147 Deputies in the vote.
226 votes were required for approval.
Libya's victory
The story of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without it there is no more war.
It remains to be defined who is the victor
As is customary in the region, Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of fiduciary whether they are moderates or radicals
The National Transitional Council has put into force the traditional law, sharia, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because thieves will have their hand cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate the the most and apostates waiting for their execution and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, society, made up of warrior tribes, will be joined by the Koran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and which we certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit the Libyans mentioned above.
The truth is that it is not surprising that Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but a great one is Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When looking for victors in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught up in a shootout that Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without guarantees of profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, it is not a problem for the locals to expel the "crusaders"
But without occupation will oil companies get hold of Libyan black gold with good words alone?
It is quite possible that it is not, but it may be that the West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of the sharia don't cross us.
A new era of crisis begins
France and the rest of Europe go on the hunt for the investor finder

Czechs qualify for Euro.
They beat 1:0 and celebrate the rankings with a 200 million premium.
The football team does the hardest task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Eech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jirásek, victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically against the attacks of the home team, so that it will not miss the European championship event.
IHNED.cz the development of the party in detail was followed in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the home team towards the end, and also the excellent game of Eech and the heroic Jirásek, won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates their pass to the European Championship.
Because of the very correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two injured in the party were Damjanovic and Vusini, who missed two major occasions.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr Eech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup event, so the coffers of national football will get a gratification of approximately 200 million kronor.
From the first few minutes there was a good offensive game.
Both teams just set out to maintain the lines and played nothing else around the middle of the field.
There was no pressure from local players in the first half, kicks to the other field in defence, just what the Czech defender knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred college students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they wish to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began praying Tuesday at noon at the facility and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center where uranium is worked.
They intend to demonstrate that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, by all indications, is eager to obtain nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began praying at noon at the Isfahan nuclear facility and then launched death slogans at the U.S. and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze Iran's nuclear program, not only the Isfahan plant, but also the Natanz facility, where uranium is enriched, would be achieved, according to Israeli sources.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner cold cuts
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, where being overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity affects 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It re-demonstrates the importance of the environment where it grows for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessive children feed, for example, on sausages at least twice as often as children in normal-weight families.
By dinner, more than 19% of obese people had dined chips the day before the test, which is linked to the prevention program "Obesity is not a fluke."
In families of overweight children there is no habit of playing sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and nearly 900 Basic Education children from across the Czech Republic participated in it.
It was already the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a fluke", supported by the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand children have participated in the project from the 4th to the 8th year.
Proper diet and plenty of family exercise are determining factors, which significantly decrease the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals a day according to the regimen: breakfast, lunch, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," one of the survey results.
No breakfast but cold cuts for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren's families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst thing was to find out that in 10% of households nothing is breakfast.
Breakfast is, however, the basis of a correct daily diet.
The study shows that in families of obese children, insane fries are consumed much more frequently.
Almost all - regardless of weight - drink daily sweet soft drinks (70%).
As a rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed sport, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Get your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen kids (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far removed from ideal."
Favourite foods include pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of sweet soft drinks is mostly alarming," the final report of the study warns.
As a main meal, the pasta is carried away and the poultry is closely followed.
Practically, children always reject legume and a taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Switching to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of study participants, who completed the questionnaire after the end of the prevention program "Obesity is not a fluke", in many cases there was a major change in favor of the principles of healthy eating", the results of the study are noted.
It draws attention, for example, to sweet soft drinks, where many children would begin to prefer regular water.
Children would also choose poultry and fish for main meal more frequently in the questionnaire and restrict consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals argue
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a little bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, how to dress up problematic characters and also a seminar on how it works in show business.
And it'll be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pin.
This time we have studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the big majority.
Someone's a cuellicorto, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves, and someone's overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We've been given some tricks on how to make Jennifer Lopez's type women's body stand out, huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dress her too defiantly
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so much that the skirt or pants do not fit, it is worth sewing at least one piece of extra custom fabric.
You will certainly not regret it, because the clothes you feel perfectly are unpayable.
With a custom skirt you will feel much better than with one that does not stop moving, getting up, dancing at the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothing with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draped.
There are certainly many types of diverse information and bodies, so I am glad that I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid that with the task assigned, I've got more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two changing rooms: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current appearance, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
It's my turn to "dress up" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately will have gained about a hundred kilos (please consider the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gómez.
The dresses have to be cut from the magazines or searched on the internet and printed, and then made graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the full result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of styling.
The stylist therefore not only dresses physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
We were told about all this by stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this is by Sunday.
The stylist must have a global vision.
The three specialist guests cheered on Saturday's conference with information on all kinds of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorn, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Rene.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, essential.
Thus, the trench-coat can be dressed in jeans and t-shirts, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll it up and raise your neck to get a totally different picture.
"Play with it, " he insisted.
What I value most is the following tip: "To start working, you need to know all the rules first."
"Then you can break them now, " said Jakub.
It is finally clear to me why we memorize all these formulas, which is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
That's not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothing in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
Thus, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And besides that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from those used in reality.
All this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorn assured us that image and style mean half of success on their own, in many cases.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is still no clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters find it useless too (my abilities are enough, my physical appearance doesn't matter as much).
And when someone asks us for our services, it should be noted that we are very likely to be told a size very different from their actual (minor) size.
Then all that remains is to gugle and find out if the magazines of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has put on weight/slimming, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist is not enough to orient himself in fashion, but that he has to understand outfit.
During your work, you mostly have to communicate with the people you saw, so it's critical to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, he doesn't miss it, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to classify her wardrobe and complete it with pretty clothes, you can't take and throw away everything there was and say, "I'm going to horror."
"Find at least a couple of things you can weigh and recommend so someone can put them on," Mario says.
He himself also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
It is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
They are objects such as scissors, such as scissors, hairthirs, or must-haves. There is also nylon yarn (which serves the stylist during the product photo shoot such as bags or caps), special garment hitch tweezers on the front, if it is larger (pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
In order not to stay in passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to coat the sole of the shoes.
Even during photo shoots in the studio, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and much more so the outside.
And we did nothing but coat and coat.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't damage them by accident.
So you had to be very skilful.
Mario has given me a joy in praising my work unreservedly.
The truth is, I'm not very good at those skills.
This is only a small part of everything we've heard all weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already realized that styling on a professional level is not a path of pink, but I don't care exactly what people say.
Need for Speed: The Run competes all over America.
Review
A trip, initially carefree, is complicated by a series of carelessness of a routine journey during tomorrow's shift.
To some extent expectations were met, but this is useless if nothing extraordinary was actually intended to be done.
The new installment, to which The Run is added, raised high expectations already before its premiere.
He promised that he would give new airs to the old Need for Speed racing saga and, following what is shown, appears as a game that should not end up being again an action genre.
We also feel curious to know what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As is often the case in NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be given as acceptable, but in the total count points are lost due to absurd failures, which have been appearing in the series for years.
In reality, they cannot even be called errors, but rather the incomprehensible degana of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to take part in an illegal race across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first ones to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
That way, you don't even remotely get the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the chart is equivalent to that of previous installments in the series.
So it's nothing of the other world.
But the walk through the desert, the fall landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you will find a sandstorm that decreases visibility.
Instead, in the mountains you have to be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of opponents (normal in a classic race), then try to buy time (timed classic duel) and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you.
In the midst of all this, sometimes the police appear, which only makes things even more difficult.
The novelty is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button just at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, however, there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you would expect (specifically there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of previous episodes.
That means that to this day it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can search elsewhere.
But a race conceived with a lot of action is very good for this style of driving, although you can find something better among the games of the competition.
So far, everything's in order.
But problems arise after a certain amount of time.
Unlike the right driving models, the same is no longer the case with collisions.
Games like this can't be expected to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can't predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, when you make a very tight overtaking or drive the car with normal traffic, there are only slight frictions, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or it even ends up totally destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, there are no big problems, but it can put you in a bad mood.
Resets are programmed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or get out of the track, the game restores you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five resets are available in each race.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a help in case something doesn't go well, but it's not very trusting.
Sometimes, even resetting doesn't help, it just helps to learn the given stage from memory.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you will find "civilian" vehicles somewhere always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you rage especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to meet in opposite directions, your opponent advances smoothly, but when you arrive, you must turn or brake.
It's the same when you arrive, because it's programmed because the "surprise" will always happen right under your nose.
Opponents also have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will reach places where, regardless of the moment, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
This also happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at whatever price.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come from the front, so at first you can make porridge the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will surely disappoint you right away.
And it's a shame, because even if the travel model is simple, the game is fun and action-action, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what's going on or where.
And it doesn't really matter, if the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the ranking in the race so that there is no boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.
You have to be attentive to the gas pumps next to the road, because right there you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases what you have will suffice.
Cars fall into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for straight highways and exotic supercars for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition, the main narrative thread also appears a thread of parallel challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know for the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both challenges and stories.
When reaching the top level, the driver opens up several possibilities, starting with the car and finishing with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you reach the tunnel of the subway (pass), where you start running in the dark along the tracks (pass).
The speedometer marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and suddenly from behind you you get the convoy of the subway and takes you ahead.
In the writing we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game none even thought a little or if the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most pleasant, sometimes even superb, visual effects.
Well, what a pity that, in the most tense moments, image quality is reduced and sometimes in a serious way.
This mainly affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please most of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of their father and mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for their music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely silly bugs, we'd have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not finished.
The fun is assured, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the strength of some airport reflectors.

The ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
Czechs have a reputation as negativists and Eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't expect an all-out war to take place."
"It will last five, six years, before the situation stabilizes a little, calms down and new players get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began with conviction.
How not to take seriously its motto "clearly and openly about Europe", which he said in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many speakers of the U Carolina Law School.
Vicenová also weighed the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing arises, that if it is insulsive, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I have to say that he left everyone baffled, because he assumes his roles perfectly."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new post of representative of Foreign Policy and Security is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call her?" This is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of political union for States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc's cheese
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda, follows and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs addressed the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at the time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the ambassador's words, "a good fuss," not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being addressed.
On the other hand, the EU's seven-year budget, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation, must be approved.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will take precedence, which countries will receive the most support, and which fewer? That is something that will be present on the agenda of the next meeting.
The ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Europe: "About Europe clearly".
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, extranjerisms or jargon that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels, curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban Olomouc cheese?"
It also aims to make more use of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speed awaits us
According to the ambassador, czechs have a reputation as Eurosceptics and people perceive the negatives rather than the positives.
In addition, it regretted the Czechs' low participation in the European institutions.
It is the fault of many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and i am approached by a Slovak, a Frenchman by my side says to me, "What, have you already been left, those of the Visegrad Group?" and it is seen that it is not funny to him."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, has some tough new budgetary policy rules ahead for the Member States.
It is perceived as a very real thing of the concept of the two speeds, if only, in Europe, more than the new one of "the European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that only countries that want and those that do not cooperate, that stay out."
"These procedures will become more and more and strengthen the two-speed Europe," Vicenová is expected.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole EU should be discussed between member states, not just eurozone members.
Brand story:
Innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone were looking for a term that would define IBM's strategy with great precision, the nearest one would be "long term."
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The basis of this long-term character was laid by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
Its motto "Think!" became its label, around which the life of the giant future will be built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised company culture.
"For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous movement going forward.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained true to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around it.
This has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century," said current company director Samuel J. Palmisano during its anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, as early as the 1930s, took care of his employees as the businessman of Baca in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacation, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication is maintained by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the beginning the company was able to discover talents (being one of the first companies in the world to end any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
At the bottom of the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM's current plan, with which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has already worked at IBM for thirty years, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years IBM has participated in so-called virtual encounters, online brainstorming, from which countless future strategies and innovations emerge.
Unsurprisingly, there are almost half a million people in the firm.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM maintained a concept of institution beyond technology company," says Harvard Business School's research economist and author of ibm rosabeth Moss Kanter's book.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users," says George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or the "Big Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world in the last hundred years.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company (it develops both equipment, programs, infrastructures and web services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents from all American technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial swaps, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM will bill this year for $220 billion. This year it has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just met customer taste and timing (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services, or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, you can't anchor yourself emotionally in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on other platforms (and still, if they don't work, it abandons them).
And that's the difference in competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is primarily dedicated to services, of which approximately one-fifth are programs and another fifth of teams.
However, even in 1990, the teams accounted for more than half of the suppliers' share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yielding assets totaling $15 billion. During the same period, he has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM acts on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of '29 increased investment.
It seems that so far the IBM company has been able to weather the crisis.
The value of IBM's shares since the beginning of 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company's net profit has continued to increase.
IBM's currency is to change everything except its value.
You can therefore hope that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will endure.
IBM history: from cheese cutter to spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, with its original name Being Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as of 1924 - it was originally a brand used in branches in Canada and South America.
The basis that led to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the 1880s.
It had inventions such as the famous "signing clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired his supervisory board.
Flint signed the head of a competitive company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The new leader eclipsed IBM's founder (Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the production and sale of all types of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During Watson's first four years leading the company, turnover doubled by $9 million and the company's large expansion on the continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, nearly forty years into the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights into space (to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pecés", which established the computer standard of that time, came to market under the name IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to Chinese company Lenovo, which, for its part, acquired the consulting part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering comprehensive advice and high value-added services.
Ibm's strategy over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, i.e. "a smarter planet."
Its objective is to make more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned and circumstances have not been improved, for example in terms of transport and city administration.
For the commerce industry, IBM not long ago introduced the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
As of 1932 he opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Here today, IBM R also operates the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague. Also here is a world-famous research team working with voice recognition.
Rychtá-ová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá-ová (53) said it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Barto-ová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
However he will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but no longer as my partner," Rychtá-ová explained.
When Darina Rychtá-ová hosted Barto-ové at home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after the singer and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned he himself, apparently accepted her husband's relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytá doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtáo broke up with Barto-ová, his wife wouldn't expect him at home with open arms.
He's the biological father of my children, and if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him out."
"But here I would live not as my dear old Borrico who was wrong, but as a man to be joined by certain ties," Rychtá-ová said, adding that he had already unhooked his husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef hasn't minded if he's been a woman, he's locked his back door.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company is still in place, I make the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping."
"Darina and I talked to each other normally, the only thing is that we don't share a bed," Rychtá said.
If Rychtá-ová found a new love, he wouldn't object.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, where she's going or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and took full responsibility," Josef concludes.
Women's worst vices: Do they also refer to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some typical vices of women, each of them will generally name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourso in the following lines, where certain feminine vices are cited that manage to boil the blood of men?
Shopping
Do you blame your half-orange for shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one rag a week?
Do you like to buy often on sale?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should appease their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to just stroll through clothing stores, look for tight-fitting garments, and then try them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically hell.
Just remember how many times you've already told your partner to better wait for you in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five kilos - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Don't these phrases ring a bell?
Isn't it?
So she's one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to hearing your partner complain all the time about their physical appearance.
Strong sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness first
It's like an infinite merry-go-round.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, remove dust, scrub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children who have soiled a freshly cleaned sink and a bookshelf with glass doors that he had so hard to clean?
In case you suffer this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should surely not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Making nasty comments
"Used underpants are left with dirty laundry."
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow too"
"The wet rag is not left on the ground!"
If you make those comments to your partner more times a day, know that's how you'll get them out of your box.
Naturally. You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women also like slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about who-type things, where, with whom, how and why.
Perso each of us sometimes misses a little harmless gossip.
With your hand in your heart, this is typical of almost every woman.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women of those who do not control themselves, who love to gossip and often do, despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a women's work team.
Jágr and Vorásek helped with their assists beat Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jaromír Jágr participated Monday in the NHL match with two assists that brought victory over the Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina court and put Czech players back at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's move, and went one step further and was declared the best player of the match.
Two assists were awarded in the match and also Jágr's teammate, Jakub Vorásek.
After the meeting, Jágr stated to overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Before the game I had told him I would triple you."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes they look like ambushes," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first trallazo.
A while later the team's second intervention also had a Czech trail.
He took the record behind the Hurricanes goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored a goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was sent off, but from the beginning of the second half they have already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot sneaked through Wayne Simmonds' goal room.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player on the court, but he's certainly in the top three," Jágr weighed on his headquarters.
"It would never have occurred to me that at the end of my career I was going to play with an athlete like him."
"I'm very satisfied with that."
"I want to play for him."
All these years at the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then Dwyer's back on penalties, until he hit a goal away.
Matt Read allowed no further complications, although they ended up outnumbered two-on-one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"He cleared the record, I took speed and Read went to the farthest part."
"I tried to hit the record and I'm happy because I got it," Vorásek described the last goal of the match as he experienced it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken over the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Opasek, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second third he withdrew due to an injury to the upper body.
The Canadiens lost not only one player with a lot of defence experience, but also a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáo Plekanec couldn't take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and playing the match with only five defenders.
"That's bad."
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novels."
"Anyway, but it's that you can't do anything against that, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, take the disc off our field."
"And so we left gaps, " explained one of the defenses, P.K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondsej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions in the 5–2 win over Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were scored by five players who thus ended a series of losses that already lasted five games.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia at the time: Oedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time in most cases sold travel only to the socialist bloc, as trips to the West were severely restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and the travels of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist bloc (that is, also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, other than the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies in those times also offered trips to the West, but one had to line up with a sleeping bag and spend the night like this, or have "good acquaintances" in the agency.
Still, not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not conceded to "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired. This custom still persists.
The Czechs' way of travelling has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was the no longer going to spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is nna great paradox, of which today we are no longer aware, the fact that to the currently favorite destination, Croatia, until 1989 could not travel freely, because it was part of the Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s visa waiver was imposed to travel to neighbouring Western European states, resulting in a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not look fed up with excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it for at least a moment.
For example, groups of Czechs slept in the parks in tents in Paris, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of Czechs at the time was to take food (preserves, cold cuts, etc.) with them to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and so did average wages, which around 1997 led to an increase in demand for travel.
With the increased demand for travel began agencies, starting in 1997 regularly, to prepare trips using charter connections, which caused travel prices to fall incredibly compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts on passenger volume.
By the late 1990s, the Czechs were already traveling visa-free to almost all developed countries except the US, which further simplified our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened as far back as 2000, when the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, thanks to enormous demand, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights depart every year with Czech tourists to far and hot countries. This winter you will already fly directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100 thousand Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this time, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. removed visas for Czech tourists, rising among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 the Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, more than 15,000 Czech kronor per head have been spent on overseas trips, including expenses at the place of stay.
Convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, who could end up again in desmate.
Czech football has been without president for almost five months, and Ivan Hasek's successor as President of the Czech Football Federation (FA-R) has not even been known after the convening of the next Extraordinary General Assembly to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you cannot even vote to choose between the three candidates.
Those interested in presiding over Czech football are Jindsich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáo Paclík.
He resigned from his post in June, not without first summoning his colleagues for the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the end of the Hasek era, a dispute broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on 16 September when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní d'm), located in the Pragmatic neighborhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not just as to the method of choice.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that point on, due to this single point, a partial agreement was reached, also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer shed either the Executive Committee which, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically solved nothing.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is this: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the bylaws or find another model," says Dusan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FA-R, who, from the leadership of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the bylaws, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will apply.
The Moravian Region is ready to reach a compromise so that the candidate with the highest total percentage of votes in both federations can win.
The bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and completely negate the concept of a bicameral system," this is how Svoboda understands the Moravian side's objections, so it would be best not to touch order and vote according to applicable statutes.
With that, surprisingly, it also agrees with Toma-Paclík, although it is assumed that the electoral rules laid down by the statutes of all candidates are more suitable for Pelta.
"I would like it to be voted on to the fullest in accordance with the bylaws."
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new president and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All passions will be appeased by today's match of our national team at the European Championships.
"Football will once again be the protagonist, and thus cooperate more at ease," says Jablonice's representative, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope an agreement is reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated."
"This is not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moorish, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to your own convenience."
"This may result in a further blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyway, I hope common sense will be imposed, " said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special aircraft, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning for technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting could finally take place at ministerial level, which they say will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeo, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to incorporate the divided parties into the country's most powerful sports organization to reach an agreement.
There is much at stake: state subsidies, football credibility and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (STV) which will seek to provide a new direction for Czech sport following the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he cannot find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of Pilsen's footballers, Toma-Paclik, before the Extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of an appropriate candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FA-R), nor would he run as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I'd be fighting for her and I wouldn't be running for election."
"But to this day a person like this has not been found," Paclík told the Czech News Agency
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the election, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FA-R).
Paclík also points out that, should he win, he would remain in the position of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that role you would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
"I've already talked to some people I might consider."
"It was crazy for me to hear some say that right now they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
"I'd like to change that vision," he adds.
What supposedly annoys Paclík at the moment is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobist capable of influencing the vote of delegates in the general assembly.
It's so unacceptable for Paclík to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In case you win, the current status would be maintained and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit," Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes UEFA and FIFA will look at us," said Paclík, who also takes with some caution his earlier statement that he would "sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta becomes president."
In the event of winning Thursday's election, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
In the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one to follow."
"He's very capable."
"I could imagine him, for example, as head of representation."
"but not as an association manager."
"I don't stick my nose in where I don't feel able to either," added Paclík, who in September attracted much attention for supporting the suspension of the Committee of Arbitrators chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He uses his management capabilities of private companies, as since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, who with his support celebrated in May the triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards Spartan President Daniel Koetínsk.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relationship between the FA-R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he put pressure on political leaders to spend more money on the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new president should be dedicated."
"If gambling taxes were raised, as announced by political parties, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to stop," he says.
In addition, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself states that the President of the FA-R must be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"Nice place to stay"
"But I don't see any point in hypocritically ceding my Pilsen Club actions to someone else and then going back there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FA-R new statutes that would end the deadlock of the election.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FA-R had new statutes that would serve definitively to resolve disputes over electoral regulations in the future.
Jablonec's representative was optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believed that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could do well for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
"People of all levels have been dealing with football for a long time and expect to meet the new President this Thursday."
"They feel it's time for someone to manage the partnership," thinks the man who partners primarily with the Jablonice Club, but who worked at Sparta and the Association's executive committee.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately, the statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought were approved at the General Assembly in June."
"If we exclude certain performances, we have had a president since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the retraining of the Civic Association's most important document was used as a decoy to win over delegates.
"If I'm elected president, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to respond in case this fails."
"It's a matter of principle, without which we can't exist," Pelta says.
Besides, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, who he respects for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
He had not attacked Thomas Paclík for a long time, who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with a head.
"He's been in the football world for over a year, and he's already achieved some successes."
"Their attacks but they were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," Pelta told his opponent Pelta, who remains true to the statements announced as early as September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the highest competitions.
The latter should be a showcase for promoting football.
"I would also try to resolve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year's corruption scandal."
"Immediately afterwards I would be involved in negotiations with the public and private sectors, to ensure that there is enough money for all football," the 46-year-old candidate told the TK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not entail any personal modification of the squad.
"I would have to know each employee's duties first," he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite current catastrophic scenarios being predicted before the next general assembly, he believes delegates will not travel in vain on Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly succeed.
"Football needs credibility, which will recover only if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, under his leadership, the FAER would start working hard.
If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected to the fourth General Assembly as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would surely be resentful.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard.
It wants to implement systematic change and make executive committee members responsible for each area of football individually.
It is also committed to resolving the Bohemians' case, improving relations with UEFA and FIFA, getting more money for football and continuing the work started by former President Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself entirely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, to professional football or training of young high-performance footballers."
"By this I don't mean I'd do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview for the TK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the competencies of the executive committee so that each member can dedicate themselves to a specific area."
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
"A lot of people will probably not like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, he is said to have considered not running again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and hinder every step of the way," he explained the reasons for his indecision.
"A lot of people have told me that I shouldn't give up, because then they'll give up on others too."
"It's about having faith so you don't just give up," he said.
He is also encouraged to continue the work he has already started with Hasek.
"During those two years, a lot of the work was finished that I don't want to be lost now."
"There are processes that had begun and will have their effect in a couple of years and I wouldn't want anyone to stop them," he announced, worried that if they chose the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could return to the way it was before the time of Hasek.
"I believe in order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him is above all all those people who would take care of football so that it was only a privilege for a few chosen."
"I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I'm in favor of someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football for everyone, because that's the only way everyone will feel and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be bohemian.
"While some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about dividing the second division into a Czech part and another Moravian, whose winners would go to the first division."
"There would be no current situation where we have only three teams from Moravia, which is a problem for young Moravian players," Rajchl said.
Although the presidential election was joined by The Struggle of the Pilsner Club President, Toma Paclík, Rajchl keeps believing in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving a few tens of millions of crowns of disadvantaged contracts, tv contract negotiations and lottery law negotiations.
On the other hand, it acknowledges its share of guilt that the federation is not united.
And as he proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified from regaining confidence in Czech football," he sees the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for the Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hasek has already started and would not significantly change the staffing of the staff on the committees."
"I don't want to use that to my advantage," Rajchl assesses his rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible perspective, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Anyone visiting Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbly baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder took a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something that could not be missing from her luggage, a swimsuit.
Lying on her back on the water, she looked at the artistic dome aloft, swimming towards the marble angels, who waited for her at the edge of the pool and was amazed at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his notebook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "journey through the most extraordinary baths of Centroeuropa" in 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German girl is a true bath culture enthusiast.
He doesn't want anything to do with sport, Meder says, only water is different.
It only bothers you that bathroom buffs have to settle for blue tiles and chlorine stench, while running enthusiasts can breathe the fascinating smell of fir forests or listen to the cheerful trills of birds in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says this Vienna resident.
"I started collecting nice pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
Splashing in the pool and ethereal sauna oils. The welfare factor in the pools is so great because all the senses are taken care of, according to Meder.
And if the builder tries hard, the indoor pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything bends optically: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting facts about the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly makes you want to jump into blue.
Meder, the pool collector discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths such as budapest's 100-year-old Széchenyi bath, nitrate waters are found in a unique karst cavity (cavity baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálf.rd. in Jászberény).
Many outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city sets eyes on Zurich's indoor pool, you can look at Snow-Covered Arlberb from the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
The perhaps most extraordinary design awaits customers in L'ngenfeld: The water cathedral of Atztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open fountains, steam rises in winter, while in the background the mountains of Atztal rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, wasn't overwhelmed by the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of Arpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, diesel plague is so strong that people think they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose legame sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in her search for nice places for bathing, when she wanted to visit uncovered pools and sunbathing in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she found a blocked land.
Architect Duan Jurkovic's 1902 bathroom was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbly windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the undergrowth grow between the tiles.
The decline countered in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; Not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but also an Arabic alhambra-style hall, added in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite bath of the pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural to the Black Forest.
"It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unit," Meder says.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not matter much.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank looks at commodity business
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg
For citizens, the issue is clear, according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans do not think it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges raise prices, and banks take responsibility for the global problem of hunger.
The consumer advocate's campaign is aimed in particular at Josef Ackermann, director of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was thought to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that players have decoupled from offers and demands, and make a profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than American competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank's good reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the demands of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to deutsche Bank's directive, along with the recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the bank's management will report the consequences.
In the end there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, broke the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Rising food price bets show particularly drastically how ruthless banks currently harm public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest banking lobbyist, especially in obligations.
"Deutsche Bank must void all investments in its portfolio in which it puts food price gambling money at stake," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann deals with the issue of hungry people or Deutsche Bank fame."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to provide a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from what was not planned on the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation he can perfect his image.
And he needs you to barely care about possible losses, that's what your successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would nullify investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 per cent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were wagered.
Many bank customers showed personal consequences in discovering that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would nullify all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43 per cent would discourage such a bank from their acquaintances, 49 per cent would apply, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The pavilion moved
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian World's Fair in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, was left empty and fell apart.
Now it's re-open as an exhibition house.
Modern post-ger architecture is passionate about, clear shapes, glass halls, brave curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its light and floating steel and glass construction.
The construction is considered to this day a contemporary milestone of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flattened building in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the southern Vienna station, was renovated in 1962 and inside a 20th century museum was inaugurated, it was called the "house 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is decaying more and more.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum was opened, to which the house belongs, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, got off to a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, an ice skater in her youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the eponymous foundation are on display, there should be a café and a bookstore and an office building should be built.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he significantly reformed Joseph Olbrichs' secession in Vienna, he expanded it and was awarded the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in his change of use with generosity and ease.
In today's reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy eater," Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, a fiberglass-reinforced insulating glass was installed, and the glass ceiling was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for new use, a panel of light descended between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter the building almost new, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in antique mahogany tones and protected against oxidation.
And the movie theater is exactly as it used to be.
And all this with strict control by the monuments office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked the monument protection office," Krischanitz says, warning of rough flooring in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz said recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case house 21 is not in the wrong place, a stroke of urban luck has happened. The brand new and planned "central station district", with homes and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps another stroke of luck will happen: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another krischanitz construction, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought berlin's temporary art room and, as you hear, negotiates with the city over a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package amounting to millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The personnel number must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against breakdowns and delays of trains caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the expected investments up to 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For which better availability of vehicles and the rail network must be achieved even with extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to bend internal and external employees to 16,000 stalls to remove snow from the tracks and walks.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice walks for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Deutsche Bahn President Rudiger Grube warned of breakdowns and train delays also during this winter following a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorization from the federal railway office for years.
In addition there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the breakage of an axle at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays million-dollar fines in the U.S.
After the tumult about President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the industry giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in an agreement, to end the strife due to the bankruptcy of five large credit unions during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage securities.
Financial market regulator NCUA criticizes many large banks inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; minimized the risks.
Such securities lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank admits no fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect client investments.
The NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions from them.
Agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also asked other major banks for accounts and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing credits.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, it led to the loss of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, a complicated wind is currently blowing for American banks.
Investors and inspection have put in countless processes to receive compensation or punish misdemifications.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most lawsuits.
It blames the 18 major international banks that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has a demand for FHFA, dealing with business worth $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to respond to "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
Finance guru Buffett invests heavily in the IBM Information Technology company.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies as the long-term development forecasts of companies are negative.
But you've read IBM's business report and changed your mind about investing in the industry.
He must have understood much earlier that IBM offers mostly services and seeks computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the Information Technology primitive should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett currently unveiled on the CNBC economy issuer that has acquired IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus amounted to one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 per cent stake.
Buffett said IBM has so far learned nothing of the commitment.
He praised the leadership that dealt with the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative Information Technology services such as the operation of calculation centers.
The old computer pioneer over the age of 100 also offers software and advice as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said he only invested in companies whose businesses he understood.
Instead, Buffett took advantage of the occasion on a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 its own subsidiaries, as well as part of a number of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly M.
Buffett, 81, took over small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the world's most valuable companies.
However, his lifestyle is humble.
That's why he's an idol to countless investors around the world.
His quick and foolproof sense of making money has given him the nickname "Omaha Oracle."
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock on the stock exchange rose by one percent.
"The Blue Giant," as IBM is known, has a public value of more than $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the world's most valuable technology companies.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn't want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is realized
After the discovery of "the Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
A newspaper talks about a "bloody ideology" that rekindle.
The murders of eight small businessmen tricks and Greeks between 2001 and 2006 have a background of the far right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin, it has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a long-time-dead ghost has returned, since the fire-shaped attacks in Mulln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, no more episodes of far-right violence against Turks had occurred.
However, there has never been any question of xenophobia in Germany.
The far-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were by no use foreseeable.
"Does the bloody ideology rekindle?" he titled the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" emphasizes on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office of Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend reminding victims of racist violence with a vigil before the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin along with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn act on the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media outlets as a slap: "The German Gift for the Fifty Anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X," referring to the background of the murder chain.
Nor does the German broadcast "Rriyet" insist on tracing this mental connection.
"It starts to smell bad," says the title of Ahmet Kohlahci's column.
He emphasizes that the killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities have not searched much earlier for suspects in the circle of the far right.
Some are at least rhetorical about the drastic means: "From now on it is lost, immigrants have nothing left but self-defense and weaponry."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the whole network," writes "Selen."
Which means that if Germany's domestic peace is in danger, the attacks in Mulln and Solingen will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been etched in the German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event more clearly showed the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks sharpen the group sentiment of the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press, the deficiency of German politics after the attacks was criticized at the time, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mulln.
After the Solingen fire-shaped attack, he sent a telegram of condolences to Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at cologne's funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what the Turks in Germany contribute to taxes.
It is clear how a person's value is calculated based on the amount of their taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media once again shows how profound it has been, since then, the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a revaluation of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The bank of the Zurich Lake Scandal
Europe's riskiest bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now it's run by a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it was known that in 2013 he would begin in a new and almost equally spectacular work: Chairman of the administrative board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly pleased, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired strength and drops kind observations about its future peers.
"USB has achieved revitalization."
"I'm happy to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grubel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all the bank's security systems and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grunbel, managing director of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the USB administrative council has since been considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber should advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the administrative council in May, not in early 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, professor of economics and a counselor and has had a surely necessary period of adaptation.
Suddenly he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved again that it deserves the title "the biggest bank in the scandal in Europe" for some time.
On the one hand, USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest property manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has slipped from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems so, is spared the once-so-proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swiss property manager, but also sly, was combined with ambitious goals, he also wanted to be a large number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and subsequent banking professor in Zurich for many years explains: "In front of my students, I have always rated USB as a model of a good bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: How could I be wrong?"
I was in big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong on usb.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was regarded as a great and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk securities and had to amortize billions.
To charge with this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course that some looked with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque state fund in Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that its name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the administrative board, in 2006 on Switzerland's second-best-paid administrative council, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, given its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Helvetica Confederation gave six billion francs for a compulsory convertible bond, through which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was claimed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it houses such large banks.
Finally, the sum of UBS's balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times greater than Switzerland's economic performance (see chart).
"We can't rescue UBS again," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over data from wealthy clients, who had possibly defrauded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a figure of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with compensation for payment.
With this, UBS more or less confessed to helping in tax fraud.
Simultaneously he lost something that had always been his capital in competition by wealthy clients: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the secrecy of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the administrative council.
And the exodus of client funds.
In this way, within a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through mis speculation and in the administration of assets by aiding tax fraud.
And just as it was a little quieter again, just when the UBS was thought to get it back, this unfortunate history of the trader happens, an individual trader defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it was revealed, it appears, this still does not work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not dominate risk controls."
So came the idea of caution, with which Swiss bankers had long presented themselves, to be the guardians of the world's greatest assets: no risk too great, on the other hand, the security of money wants to go bankrupt on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability, such as Lindt and Spr'ngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich does not fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it is only a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich's Bahnhofstracae Street, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, the rents are one of the highest in Europe.
Here you will find jewelry stores such as Tiffany's among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Confectionery Spr'ngli.
Swiss banks have lived here for years: from the national bank, through credit suisse palace, to elitarian private banks such as Julius Bor.
You enter the UBS reception room through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather armchairs, next to the logo of the bench there is a large sign to indicate "safety".
UbS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two large Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point shifted the idea of the large Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the paper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the businesses of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, it believes, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
There the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long become accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then disaster came, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-dollar country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation," author Lukas Hssig writes in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How can you think of that?
We talk to Swiss bankers, so they see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges that, due to the merger, was too big for little Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served to ensure that the two different forerunner banks of UBS complemented the two banks: a rich but asleep bank with the center of property management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bike.
There are two names related to this ubS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the administrative board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the modest intellectual who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive one who managed to make his way from learning in the bank to the summit."
Finally, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were a reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It's clear: The desatiny came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, in which Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Get Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the League Tables, the rankings that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be at the top.
Some steps went well for him.
In forex trading and in stock trading it was at the top.
However, the advisors of companies in charge highlighted a weakness: In the business of international interest, in the "fixed income" banking language, there is huge compensation for large banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid growth, they invested both the same bank and one of its hedge funds created in high-risk American investments.
It became a powerful machine for securitizing American mortgage loans and then selling them, keeping certain risks on their own.
And also, like other banks, he sought the descent for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
A manager had to leave, as the attempt to order proved more complicated than they expected.
The stalls at UBS became projectable seats and are insecure to this day.
Today, who runs a large bank, has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, wherever all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a bank expert, has an idea, ending investment banking, concentrating on property management, returning to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to get that far (yet).
But investment banking needs to decline a lot, it's clear today.
The following Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank's new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank was surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grubbel.
In the meantime, he prevailed: He must permanently run ubS business, he reported the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Delete 3, 500 seats.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is currently asking.
So far he's just saying he's going to find a house with his wife in Zurich first.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared American investors at the start of the week.
Changes of government in Athens and Rome remain out of vigour.
The industrial production curbed on the continent stifling hopes to stabilize at its source a crisis caused by indebtedness.
General relief on changes of government in Rome and Athens may not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has looked half full, not half empty, but now the problems are back in the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are on the sales list.
The Dow Jones index of standard values closed with a drop of 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.

The industry in the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its boom.
The companies produced two per cent less in September than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat's statistics office.
Which created skepticism among American investors: "We are not an island, if not dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be liberated so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this precaution, it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for THE CNBC.
That is why, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in state borrowings or European banks.
Instead, he throws away a decade of old principles and enters the American tech sector.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supports the share price of the traditional consortium and makes it trade against the market trend at first just a higher percentage.
The value closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

The share price of its investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3%.
Bank of American's stakes were clearly strengthened by 2.6% of the market.

Aircraft construction company Boeing increased its profits and thereby limited losses on Dow.
The action was raised by 1.5 per cent, after the consortium was commissioned the largest in its history.

Smart rooks spread in cities
In many places the rooks are considered "problem birds": these very intelligent animals are not expelled from cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the roos belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities accumulate the complaints of the neighbors for the crap and noise of the animals.
Although no means have appeared against the "problem birds" so far.
The roomes no longer leave the cities, experts say at the first symposium on roos in Read, East Frisian.
There specialists from all over the national territory discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected roos from the countryside; chemical applications in agriculture visibly wipe out traditional living spaces.
Hunting, increasing building and falling trees that host them make the lives of birds difficult.
The roos are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005, a controversial project to kill district rooes en masse hit negative headlines.
Critics have called hunting animals through bird traps and killing with sticks as especially brutal.
"Expelling and driving them away in a normal way is achieved nothing," said Werner Kl'ver, urban planner and landscaper of Leer.
Shooting with water at nests or throwing trees are often unintenesy consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, Lahr's environmental expert, Baden-Wurtemberg, too.
"The animals defvate, the great colonies divide and distribute elsewhere."
Driving them away is only imaginable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them."
Without the surroundings, the problem in cities is not solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals away from sensitive residential areas and baits is possible to resettle elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jargens, psychologist and ethnologist advertises against in order to treat animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can withstand a beak in the face with aplomb."
He co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circuit on The Staples of Ascheberger, where signs report on the lives of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
He also has his own opinion on criticisms of the noise of birds: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the roos not only take advantage of the resources to access shale bites, but they manufacture tools to use as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge tested in four rooes how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larvae.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second essay, the cunning roos had to solve a complicated problem.
Researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larvae on a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
But the investigators left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they caught the bucket in the tube handle.
Three of the four roos got it on the first attempt.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
Favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be at Euro 2012.

Former Wolfsburg team player Manchester City sent a headbutt to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek hit the Czech Republic
Then the collegiate Wolfgang Stark, of Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penati area, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark beeped a controversial penalty following an action by Fabio Coentrao, who transformed Misimovic.
After halftime, the 2004 European vice-championship clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs finished the last doubt in the 81st minute. with petr Jiracek's goal.
The 1976 European champion qualifies for the fifth consecutive time for the Euro.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nurnberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a second reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflex a possible goal on Tomas Sivok's own doorstep (9.).
Montenegro had a better chance with duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute. from the turn of the front, very right at Cech's goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper's length from the world-famous goalkeeper, FC Seoul's striker escaped again (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end sentenced the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey wasted the wonder of Zagreb football.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not go 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink should leave his third-rate bench seat at the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth appearance in the Euro final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seven-minute and with a long-distance shot, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the pole. Attacker Kazim Kazim also couldn't send the ball inside the goal.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly assumed control.
After the break, Croatia did not let him score any goals.
Together with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute. made room for Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Legionnaires of the Bundesliga in practice.

Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who triumphed with 4-0 in the first leg prepared for a previous decision, took the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied for the guest team.
Ireland lobbied from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big break.

Personal massacre
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story About World War I, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can cause one's soul to fall at your feet.
Here are some acting tips: Gently start this page and make it your brand pages.
You will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novelistic narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, like one of your men and women, you are confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he aptly describes as "an anti-history work."
It contains some notable names, important treatises or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as "a book about how it happened." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"The beauty and pain of battle"combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go crazy, or die.
Their lives flicker here like lighted votive candles in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others turn off.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that World War I was only the terrible trench war on the Western Front.
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on the hives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods these people's lives like a natural catastrophe, a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or run away?
Who's coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what's going on, or even why this war has to be fought.
"Lack of facts," mr. Englund observes, "has been filled with guesswork, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"The Beauty and Pain of Battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the high seas fleet.
His stories have been obtained for the most part from memoirs, letters and other material already published previously.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in Mr Englund's accumulation of small moments, lost details.
A lot of these are about deprivation and getting by with what's in it.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl says, "Substitutes, everywhere substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about sucedane food in Germany.
Describes "meat made from rice cooked and pressed in ram fat (and topped with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from dried potato roots and peels; shoes with wooden soles."
There are, he observes, "837 substitutes allowed for meat in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own impulse towards savagery and manifests about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are designed for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and whiskey, the afternoon newspaper or a bestseller, and pretend that this varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starched, studded breastplate."
Instead a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once you resign yourself to the thought of sacrificing yourself, you would like to think it might happen in front of the public," he writes.
Instead, it's horribly similar "to a convict being strangled in secret."
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in garments of good tailoring that executes his butcher's shop while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund talks about soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear with it their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, which often results in lifetime blindness."
In this translation of the Swede by Peter Graves, Mr Englund's prose, agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to his human task.
Dozens of small scenes reflect how war "uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's modern memory, or novels such as Novelty on Erich Maria Remarque's front, rather than integral stories.
Mr. Englund's volume joins an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a nonfiction play.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous false step, a planned round to the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen monday night through Tuesday because Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling others they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscored how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department.
Episodes of recent weeks, such as spraying pepper spray on protesters, could not be repeated, violating department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "squatters."
And that's why the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park from protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared to see how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye facing Zuccotti.
Officers increased so-called training of disorders - counterterrorism measures involving rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came at the "last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise."
"To the few cops I know who were called for this, they didn't tell them it was to enter Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the apartment."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters emerged early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile officers who routinely used to flood neighborhoods with a high crime rate.
Mr. Kelly said many people, like those who commute to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do it when the fewest people were in the park," he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with spotlights and speakers gathered at the Pike Slip junction with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The pre-recorded lights and messages rumbling from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No tent was touched until 1:45 a..m m., police said, giving protesters time to pick up their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said an attempt was made to prevent police from coming into action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the officers.
Mr Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the dense tangle of personal effects of protesters, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags overcrowded with clothes, Cleaning Department teams followed, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged outside, with images appearing on the Internet a short time later.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchenette, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came in to methodically arrest them.
About 10 people at the epicentre of the camp were sung with each other by the arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m," Mr. Kelly said.
The clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disruption of public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking agent at the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives in the department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not running the operations, " said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were raised on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block to the south.
From those positions, police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the north perimeter.
Some of the loudest action of the night took place south of the park.
At around 5 a.m.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking air off the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
In the end, an agent and a protester were hospitalized.
Support workers' union to sue city over layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon available to the union, the 37th municipal district, in its effort to overturn layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, the coordinators of parents and other employees who were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on October 7, in a movement that union leaders have described as a political vendetta for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund run by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said layoffs were a part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council counterattacked by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be dismissed.
Officials in the 37th Municipal District said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that he would be sued. A press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the official filing of the lawsuit at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and has eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the city's Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific claims.
According to a draft of the new York Times lawsuit, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying poor schools lost more attendees, as they had been chronically under-subsidized.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and a few layoffs at schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 schoolchildren lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight attendees employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, demand says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit."
P.d. The 36th district budget fell by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more often describes the act of moving a teacher from a school payroll to a work bag, whose salaries are paid by the head office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired," the draft complaint says, "and not just in excess."
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and U.S. involvement came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "bravery."
"This resolution is to honor Libya's brave people as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting each other and with the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain filed a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill was rejected in the House, the chamber also rejected a move that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the U.S. mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not angry enough to actually mow the grass under his feet.
Then the congressional indecision was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO's mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves" and "praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also "declares america's national interest in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's top Republican.
The local spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House is going to vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The move, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other issue that actually gets a senate-wide vote in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful so far in sending their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicates - the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations between them.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment in the House alone, and another handful will "control federal spending."
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially novice Republicans looking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of this amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can serve, while Rep. José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the annulment of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of states.
So enthusiastic that they have been members in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
At the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - on 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at point-blank range at a constituent event in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat for Arizona) appeared on national television monday night, sang accompanied by the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult path back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the House to cast his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked him how he feels, Giffords, 41, replied, "Pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special hour-long "20/20" program, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program analyzed Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scar passing through her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers upright, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach him how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frown on the lips.
And then his first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast," a request for change on his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast on ABC show that the music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Falling".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said she was read giffords an article in the paper about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to first ask about the six who had died in the incident.
Suspected gunman Jared Lee Loughner is being held in a Missouri prison and is being forced by force while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died, " said Giffords to Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point in her wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
"So, I said, "'Gabby, you haven't been defeated, ' said Kelly.
"You've just been beaten.
And you're going to get out of this, and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever."
Troops make you feel more sorry than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines stormed their posts around him.
The crowd of etiquette stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were regarded as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized spring fundraising.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They showed them as some kind of orphaned child," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really. It was a shame.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has gripped the military and an often distant, sometimes worshipping American public.
Troops are praised for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, service members say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were sorry for those uniformed.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not want to seem ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of fear because they confronted the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be an "angry and violent veteran beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to high-level government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to hold on under pressure from a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions," Cancian recalled, telling her children.
Military unease arises, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in World War II," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public focuses heavily on the depth of a service member's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
Army faces increasing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army because of their alleged passivity in the face of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was on his way back to his barracks at Miramar Air Force Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a pack of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"An alarm signal sounded," Lyman says.
However, the Texas native put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached him from behind, throwing her down and raping her, he alleges.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel eagerly await a court decision at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington attorney, D.C., the lawsuit initially implicated 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claiming that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their comrades, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or deliver proper justice after alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going to get the army's main page, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a top-down structure," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture from retaliation? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, nearly 400 more survivors have been in contact with her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, he will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The Defense Team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - in essence, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
"The alleged damages are part of the plaintiffs' military service," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the '50s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the army to modernize, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway besides hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
Moreover, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is suing the military that focuses on the diagnoses of "personality disorder" assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network , a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing her of discriminatory practices in the way she handles benefit claims for people claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a number of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense's Office for The Prevention of Sexual Assault and Response.
However, the aggressions are notably underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which number about 13.5% of the estimated 19000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines indices: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military went to trial - half as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged violation to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, he says, he was asked to tell the details of his rape 11 times different from a crowd of cops, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of her assailant - from a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people tested as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to go to work -- I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the psychiatry unit, and when I came out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was exempted from service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefit.
As to whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow defendants continues, it's a very remote possibility, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a permanent critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn't have the same incentive and deterrence that responsibility poses.
He adds: "The odds are strongly against them. but it's important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go your way, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will line up your hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform occurs," he says.
"Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new side of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another guy who aerated his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to conducting a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of his time preceding his attack on his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing social media groups.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just log in to Facebook.
"We realized it wasn't that hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British DEMOS study centre.
Facebook's stash of personal information is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy – the way sellers have been using it for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence, and optimism about their own future.
Arriving via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – all without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way to do an investigation," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those left behind the computer screen."
DEMOS' work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming an important new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health problems to social trends as expressed in the Likes, wall messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom, boosting the number of academic papers with the site name in the title to nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go through the game, and they'd never let you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook eliminates all that -- you go to them directly."
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of drinking problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that student peers, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who posts too many status updates with their drunkenness.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Child Development at the Seattle Institute for Child Research, the Washington Post said.
"We have found a way to identify at-risk children who would not otherwise be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "clicking" its own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has produced statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expectation of voter turnout midway through the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness index (mainly using the information that can be accessed - advocates of digital freedom have long argued that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - the sacrifice for being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is an open bar for everyone.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a 2006 study he conducted with the public Facebook walls of students.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there's the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know that some of a user's profile information and wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes a paper clip and pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There's no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of the social still happens offline."
"Cold and inhumane: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court, as it received the mandate of organizations that support hateful ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the facts but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a handwritten speech in advance, to address his victims' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for an additional 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is locked up.
All attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian station NRK.
"It was awkward, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked reporters and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a major "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mentally ill person, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be comforted that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn't automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it doesn't look like it, " said a relative of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seemed so."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview are shown at a theater this week
After steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - distinguishing the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview with jobs recently rediscovered that has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special projections in the biggest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about the business processes and workflows of the products.
He was certainly a self-known designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a yonki of flowcharts - a man who believed that many executives suffered "a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
By that time it had been only 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and was already working hard at his new computer company NeXT, awaiting popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transportation.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full vhS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly reissued footage is the basis of Steve Jobs: The 68-minute lost interview that arrives at Landmark theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are great silences between questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs' perfectionism surfaces, where he seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to move faster toward the most important issues or arguments.
Filmed before the Pixar era, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic about The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies do well and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read portum reviews of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, he went and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers they give you invariably are, "Oh, that's just the way it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes your efforts to simplify Apple accounting in detail.
Baffled by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was done in the eye of a good bucket, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine business costs in detail.
About the joke to the Pope:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" he built himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make free long distance calls.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and you were screaming over the pay phone and coming back a minute later to the pay phone next door," Jobs says with a giggle.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
The two of us didn't know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing - it was an amazing lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak with the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, on the hunt for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had ever seen at that age and formed my vision of what a company was and how well they treated its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, I had a small cathode tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
About improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the go.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of motherboards, asked a customer if he could assemble all the equipment.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went outside and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
About big companies losing strength:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs prophetically foresaw how many industry leaders would stumble into his vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make photocopiers and printers better, so what?"
You have a monopoly on market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it's these kinds of people who end up running companies and product managers are expelled from the decision-making forum.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position rots because of people who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - knowledge of the necessary trade.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire IT industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the big idea evolves, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make - some things you can't make electrons, glass makes them, robots make them, factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste - it comes down to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to the ones you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing big ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who coincidentally were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law rivals as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether they would accept the challenge to President Obama's health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were housed in a bar-sponsored dinner that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a war cry for conservative activists across the country.
The magistrates agreed to accept the lawsuit and, in fact, a five-and-a-half-hour historical plea is expected for March, and the result is likely to further cloud the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision becomes known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and allege that the law should be dismissed will likely be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the Federalist Society's annual dinner, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, they would arguably fall under the Canon 4C Code, which reads: "A judge can attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honor, or be on the agenda of such an event."
However, Scalia and Thomas' absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with enormous financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in government.
"This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the lawsuits of several magistrates who abide by the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"The judges were treated in a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court."
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they too easily mix the court's activity with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as attorney general of the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law for now to be impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives record $18 billion request
Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 dual-aisle aircraft, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than $1 billion.
It is rarely news when a company obtains an order of 50 units of its product.
But it's a big transaction when the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. aircraft and the selling price for all 50 aircraft amounts to a record $18 billion.
It's as big as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that over the next 20 years airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft worth in dollars - 50 Boing 777 double-aisle jets.
The successful order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total sale price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel economy and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora said.
"The quality of these particular customers is very strong."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by their oil-producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but an increase in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines, because it is one of the biggest costs - is not so damaging, because the country is making money by increasing the price of oil.
That's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have natural protection, " he said.
The Emirates' request solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS's attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger jet at bay.
Boeing's victory at the air fair comes four months after Airbus said it was going to delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and rank.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of Mexico's president, apparently defeated in Michoacán's vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor's contest.
President Felipe Calderón's sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," Luisa María Calderón said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... They seized the ballot boxes, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly overtaken Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate of his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, currently in the position of governor, came third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is President Calderón's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive targeting traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant Michoacán's elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging, ahead of next year."
The BAsD urges Asia to help bail out eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would impede the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world's two fastest growing economies had to "do everything they could" to accelerate the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against bric [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe's difficulties in an "impartial" manner and said that Asia's financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help prevent a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview within the framework of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means."
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have soared dangerously and prime ministers in Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's current sovereign debt crisis has raised fears that it could push the world economy into recession and generated calls for major emerging economies to come forward to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of EU bailout fund bonds, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, Indian Trade Minister, said "India is going to do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and depletion of foreign capital inflows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when faced with their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India's one billion and two hundred thousand people, of whom up to $800 million lives on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they'll realize that the Greeks are retiring at the age of 50 and going on vacation to the beaches and that won't be right," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs for poorly managed companies, and loss-generating workers such as railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "significant chain effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5% of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces "down risks" due to Europe's threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday, warning that up-and-coming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial reaction from the pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan's battlefields, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion reductions over the next decade, but now fears an additional reduction of $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress's failure to reach agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping," would lead to 23 percent global reductions and a stop to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would mean that most of our shipbuilding and construction projects cannot be executed - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to unintentionally set aside many of our civil servants, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to license civilians in order to meet the goal."
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage goodwill."
The cuts would over time catch up with the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding in Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by kidnapping, war efforts would be adversely affected by serious disruptions to base budgets," Panetta warned.
"Recruitment would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and oversight of the contract supporting the war."
"Payroll staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequence of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not an outcome with which we can live, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves."
"Kidnapping is a threat to america's national security interests, and it should not be allowed to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and the senators' recent warnings will increase the pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts, it remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience in Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's an aerial wing without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to fulfill the mission," Panetta said in his opening re-opening words at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how reductions "generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limits our ability to be deployed and pre-engaged around the world; and poses an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship, and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the F35's additional development and testing could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step in improving and addressing potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at the latest headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment allegations with several women; each side accuses of lying to the other.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly hiding reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "caught" with an open microphone claiming to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed races and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself with his quickly demented debated by the irrefutable test.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And, again, no one who lived it will ever forget president Bill Clinton's media circus by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating on school and college exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given test responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On any other day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere 10 to 200 times.
That's for sure, a lot of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Detecting lies, or "the location of lies," is an essential skill that we must all acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained over the last six decades in prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about lying have been disputed.
Liars do look into their eyes.
They don't always stutter, babble, blush or restless.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years proning scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that detecting deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or negotiating management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel at ease, handling their own emotions and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "lies oriented toward themselves," while women tell more "otherwise-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than non-married people (but the lies they often tell tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as an evildoer, others will feel less guilty lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's usual behavior.
This is called "creating a baseline".
Helps provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Observe the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristic.
You'd better know if someone normally hits your foot all the time so you don't make unfair accusations when you see your feet pounding in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for deceptive, verbal, and nonverbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavior groups as alarm signals, not evidence of deception.
Cheating people can freeze the upper body as they try to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a "post-view relief" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions are over.
Interrogators often falsely see that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up and used the past time while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide search for her.
Cheating people can also use a differentiating language: "I didn't have sex with that woman. Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell you the truth... up to what I know... to my mind."
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances to avoid being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan diverted following threat of U.S. delay in approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- inf solidarity with unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to re-route it.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will gain approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada executive Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that over time the pipeline will be approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This follows last week's announcement by the State Department that they would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied to avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast groundwater supply.
"This is a real path of progress," Rep. Lee Terry, Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and expressed all his support to them.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels per day from Alberta Province to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would be necessary for him to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have opted for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and ogallala Aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobby member hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the show.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of her Manhattan building, terrating her young daughter to the point that she vomited in fear.
The diatribe of the singer of "Lady Marmalade" frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much so that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family says in Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when stager Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was taking the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with his luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went to get it, " he said.
LaBelle the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "I shouldn't have left her daughter near the door, " said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I have no interest in what you say or think."
He became enraged and began to use bad words -- the word C and the word J aloud...
I had a bottle of water and he started throwing the water from the bottle over me."
She said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you've done to my daughter, " said the girl's mother.
LaBelle slapped at the mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and removed from a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so hard she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks uns specified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a support association for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her behavior," Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when you're addressing a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During mario López Valdez's first year of management, unemployment and informality have increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment fell and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in sinaloa's economic history, this is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled with change, which generated high expectations regarding advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, instead there is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
February's low temperatures, in addition to causing million-dollar losses for the agricultural sector, limited the chances of the state economy growing, caused a contraction in overall economic activity of 3.6% in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic 31.16 percent drop in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the frost impact report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares cultivated were damaged, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent had partial damage, the main sinister crops being vegetables, maize and chickpea.
The fall in economic activity has led, until November, to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloenses were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population , for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in number of people throws more than 74 thousand unemployed Sinaloans, an increase from the first half of 18,969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out since public policy.
"What is being seen is unemployment growth that has to do with a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market from the effects of a resource constraint by the legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work , invest them and use them in something," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes noted that in the increase in unemployment there is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state looking for work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties of entering, and second because they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people are staying and demanding sources of work here in the state, which causes unemployment to rise" Said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population occupied in the state works without being listed as a worker before any social security institution.
Coupled with unemployment and informality, another of the state's labor lags are low wages, the entity has the lowest remuneration in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income for Sinaloan workers was, as of September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, at 7,375 pesos.
IED shrinkage
Coupled with falling economic activity and growth in unemployment, during 2011 there has been the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of the Economy from January to June on state EDI totaled $630,697, representing a fall of 87.74 per cent from $5 million,143,312 per cent during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government counts a total investment of 17 billion pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
Faced with the economic downturn, the state government in July requested the state congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to revive the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2.6 billion pesos , and until November they have not seen the benefits of borrowing in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that during 2011 the harmonization of wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself, was lacking.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, it lacked to align the effort of all and above all the good progress already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better" Expressed.
Economic slowness
Loredo López stated that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had" Mentioned.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronial Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he stated that it is required to channel the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"Overall we have observed that work has been underway, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resource is detonous," he said.
Work to be done
The President of coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better undertoopies the Government's efforts.
"Generally speaking, I would say that the Government has been striving to do well in different areas, there are some progress in terms of economic development, but it is important that a long-term programme is developed," he said.
He noted that the current administration had shown progress in the way it conducted public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to say that the Government is being more understandable, and what I can say is that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done," he said.
He is convicted of 8 kgs of marijuana
A five-year prison and a 100-day fine was sentenced to a neighbor of Navolato for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Office of the Attorney General of the Republic reported that the sentencing drug dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime of against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for trade purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, off Post 80, in El Castillo village, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving in a white pick up pickup truck, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and in the co-pilot's seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured was made available to the Second District Judge and the sentencing remains in the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
You must contribute for works
Social works covered in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that while work programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk as the State Government had not complied with its contributions, which add more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
It noted that in total the investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounted for 25% and that so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for the works, so that the possible delay in the completion of the works became effective.
"There are almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a share," he said, "we so as not to delay we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with its contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not provide at that time.
"It happened to us in the previous six years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs kept walking, and this year we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending," he said.
Although there was a commitment by the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the efforts so that their percentages arrive as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us a fifth."
Corte validates "analog blackout" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional disputes brought by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog blackout" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate it did not meet.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to realize the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not reaching a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft judgment, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favor of the project they voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero hem.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional disputes to challenge the decree, and by admitting the claims, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions therein arranged for the digital transition.
The full minister decided to dismiss also the demand brought by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into discussion of the project, also by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Minister-President said he did not agree with the project's arguments that the federal executive could not structure through general rules measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not believe that doing so would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, who has as a constitutional mandate, the rectory of the state.
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, resulting in better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone change, he argued, would be to put off the benefits of digitization, which involves a decision in the public interest, which has not only a technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he emphasized, "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectory of the State, encompassing a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
It recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition, and had done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, which in any way invades the sphere of competence of Congress, because compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative is being provided in the administrative sphere, he said.
They look at the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count in Michoacán
According to data PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is just 27 per cent, even if the votes for 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes are not counted.
The possibility of the "vote-by-vote" count is a reality as far as this year's electoral process is concerned in Michoacán, where according to data from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in this year's election in Michoacán, where according to data from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is just 27 percent, even if the votes for 879 out of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes are counted.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, just on November 9, the electoral management body adopted a series of guidelines to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
As will be remembered, Michoacán did not homolog its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or Its Electoral Justice Act, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication within the time limits provided for in the Law of the Official Newspaper of the State , on the grounds that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislative branch and called the state government's vote for constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" since it has no right to "sanction or veto" them.
Interviewed around the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Angeles Llanderal stated that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may occur in cases where: the results of the minutes do not match; there is no counting and counting record in the box file or it is not held by the chair of the box; or, where there are obvious errors or alterations to the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the vote received at all polling stations in the election may be carried out where there is evidence that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the election concerned and the candidate who has obtained second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that at the start of the session there is the express request of the party representative and/or coalition who nodded to the second of the designated candidates.
The total count of the vote may also be carried out if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, in which case the electoral packages that have been partially counted will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 per cent, although without accounting for the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, confirms the family.

They locate three abandoned bodies on Cadereyta NL estate
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented eleven people to the media who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, on an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the brink of economic disaster
Italian pm Mario Monti will meet on Wednesday with Italy's president to introduce the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form a government.
It is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he will present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is now well delineated," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, as Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the shocked confidence in Italy.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, market instability put the yield on Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7%, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were significantly driven by the backing of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of the LDA, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockade or delay in their efforts could lead to a devastating new attack by financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups on Monday, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He'll end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels a few times ache of uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Rescuing Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the eurozone's current financial defenses.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before advancing the election.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that he should be made up only of technicians, an indication of his qualms about a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The rubbing of the Spaniards is superior to that of the ticos
Of spain's 22 so-called footballers, ten exceed 50 international games.
On Costa Rica's side, only one of the 22 called up reached 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica's, compared to the 22 convened by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ranquin, count an extensive record of Class A inter-election games, the Tricolor only possesses defender Michael Umaña as the only one with all 50 international matches.
This figure was reached the previous Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and powerful Clubs of the English Premier League, maintain intense activity in league and domestic cup championships, and high-level clashes in European Cups such as Champions League.
To this is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated playoffs of the Euros and the World Cup.
Tic footballers, on the other hand, have limited international friction in an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the top record of the Spanish national team is that of the goalkeeper Eker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (fall 0-1 in London) matched the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolor and impose a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, brain flyer of Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenaries of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the battering ram of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the century-old figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, at 53.
On the attic side, and near Michael Umaña, are the left-back Junior Diaz, with 48 appearances and gunner Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five beat 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least of them.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 appearances, are Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't come close to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba dos, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar owns only one and Alman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not yet debut.
Spain's historic goal scorer is David Villa, with 50 targets, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one with the most so many with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country on its two-decade celebration tour
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to perform one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It has been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band claims that for them it will also make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
This was assured by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., with the angel band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is in The Nation on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are you aware of what your fans are living?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I have been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're going to be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to bring our music there.
I ask you because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live intensely in the days before.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side throughout all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even refer to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the last 21 years happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends were always going surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we've never played there before, then we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best possible show with a good variety of songs; we'll try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this all about?
I think it's partially because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have been not playing for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting to us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of experience.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined that we'd be in a big rock band and doing it for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the emergence of grunge?
It's always been an honor to be part of that group of big bands.
We are very close friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a move comes from a group of friends and it's rare.
Occasionally, a band emerges from a city, but it's much stranger when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them yet and we're honored to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It's also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands last.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to still be alive and, secondly, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened that give each one freedom to experiment.
We entrust each other to each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been simple; however, thanks to their success, they have been able to do whatever they want.
How do you find a balance?
As we've grown, it's been easier to find a balance sheet.
We make sure you don't be too on tour because it's easy to fall into that game from the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for music, that reminds you to respect the music and what brought it, without being infatuated by being famous and being a rock star, something none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was a great thing.
We were a band for almost three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There were a lot of frustrations because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we're still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a picture I think about the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was an amazing human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we can't wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do yellow Ledbetter's lyrics always change live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he can think of.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
That's so many.
Among the first I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fad?
I think all of us always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of her, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone that came up at the same time, and, if there's relevance now, I think it's a wonderful thing because it's music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first, his music had darker content and has now become more positive.
What is the point of this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that may seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cried when I heard them and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs certainly represent that to me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that's dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is re-admitted for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted tuesday to a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in his legs, his GP reported.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from a number of ailments, including a cancer of the tongue for which he has been operated on four times and is kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength of its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his view Fujimori would be a candidate to profit the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not wish it because he is known to be innocent.
It was operated on four times of cancer of the tongue, has a weight weight loss of 18 kilos that have been joined by other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, the cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving in detention since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people at the hands of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official conitiva, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican peer, Felipe Calderón, a high point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, according to the agenda disseminated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information in all that political matters are between the two nations", as published by the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arising when french representative Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that led to Uruguay's rejection and the call to consult its ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group made up of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries since November, and has had an agreement with the South American country since January of this year to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to expedite the concretion of tax exchange agreements in order to emerge from the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), made up of countries that did not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
At the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 with a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachioed plumber spends all three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he has never done so before in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," said Nintendo's spanish press manager Omar Alvarez during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez noted that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally intended for that support", as until now hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to engage less skilled users.
Once surpassed, the most experts will be able to give a "second round" to the game levels, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray of Super Mario in all three dimensions also means the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that had not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes nods to fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of previous installments, consisting that the moustache plumber will have to travel mine platforms of danger in order to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom endorses Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he was processing the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond in the United States for the conspiracy to wash US$70 million.
This completes the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge it there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision is due to the independence of judiciary and executive, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered extradition.
He asserted that during his tenure he "did not get his hands on" in court rulings and prosecuted all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
What Colom did is an executive process after all judicial and constitutional bodies were exhausted to prosecute the former representative between 2000 and 2004.
According to rulings of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once its legal status in Guatemala has been resolved and its human rights guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted by the embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in marginality of uneded children
The balance of the first 25 years of life of social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
Add to this the hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an event held at the former Fabra i Coats factory complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, no work, problems with dogradication or in a situation of falling into marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary nature of Trinijove's work.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Ricard Gomo attended the event.
The current conseller of Benestar Social i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of La Caixa's social work, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large hall of the Fabra i Coats.
But he claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is too, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight bad circumstances and for giving hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the entity and to the work it does," he said.
Evicted an okupada estate where macro-partys were made
The invaders had taken over 11 of the building's 13 floors, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived by the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday's midday voluntarily the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macro-parties that despaired the neighborhood, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was complete, the door lock was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From now on there will be an access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been harmed.
Its owner Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has dropped by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub points out that the invaders of the farm gave him unfair competition, as they sold the cups for three euros, while in the nightclub they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had had to respond to neighborhood noise complaints, while, as she noted, the inconvenience was not caused by the guests of the nightclub, but by the inhabitants of the okupada house and, above all, the party-goers who were organizing there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to angry neighbors in the area.
The manager of the nightclub explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago she "forgives" the rent.
The Urban Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the municipality, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week "immediately evict the property to eliminate the problems of coexistence and civics that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the last few months the squatters had been entering all floors of the building and on almost every floor, and that in some even there have been thefts.
In this sense he added that, "impunity must be ended and strong against the incivism that has been generated on the estate."
Also yesterday, the Mossos vacated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30am the police headed until 35 Mont-ral Street, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the occasion of the call beyond controversies over fees
The 16-door municipal competition opens the debate on Collserola's role in Barcelona
Averaged from the 80's, in full swing of the now defunc Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed some pasquines of promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
More than that, it was accompanied by a comparison, in numbers, with New York Central Park.
With the death of the WBC, in 1987, the park was again located, in the imaginary of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but above (mountain) -down (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is based on this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of Yogi Bear.
In these it was until, in September, the city council convened a megacommunication composed of 16 contests for so many other gateways to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of park, no doubt.
Either that or someone intends to put doors to the field.
The question goes out on its own: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competition, both for its purely organizational aspect and for what it means to reflect on the city is the topic of conversation between all Barcelona architects.
It is almost already a recurring theme to lend to when two members of this former caste of elelected are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, who have presented thee.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mudol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it becomes necessary" to debate "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of green apples, has not taken place.
"It is worth starting from the basis that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", sentences the architect for whom the title of "doors of Collserola" encloses a "lexical trap": you should not think of them "as accesses to a park, but the delimitation of areas where you have to act".
As Roldán and Bayonne with experience in the urban world, M'dol describes the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers arising from how "uncertain it is today to project public space" after the experience lived in the 80s and which had in the area of the Forum "his song of the swan".
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
"Limiting something is already fixing the next step", that is, its overstepping.
"We need to think of new urban planning instruments, because current ones [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM) ] can lead to real disasters."
More close to the question, he believes that, simplifying, the trove of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no", for a purely topographical issue.
He recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he appreciates the opportunity that the city council offers its guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the mountain's proximity to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubts" about whether it is this technical profile that must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success", he points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should be just a tool".
Bayonne suggests that the answer to the question giving title to this piece is complex, because at the base of the contest is missing a global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional contests have been convened, he says, in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
This means, at least where appropriate, that you have chosen to participate in all 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can clash in program and definition with that of the architect of the door next door.
In its view, however, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Dalt Round should provide, in its entire extent, for an area of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonah Larrazábal and will walk free
After 72 days of entrenching, the legal proxy of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmail
After being imprisoned for 72 days, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal proxy of Casino Red granted him forgiveness before the Second Criminal District Court, which follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, The owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the city council to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public complaint, the State Attorney's Office opened criminal proceedings against the panist mayor's brother and on 2 September was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before Public Prosecutor's Office Agent 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when he was issued with a second rooting order after the Public Prosecutor's Office agent desicced the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of The Red Casino with a million and a half pesos; however, he only spent a few hours in the mid-security inmate as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was given an apprehension order by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that nearly two months of inquiries there was sufficient evidence to determine Jonah's guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the bookmaker.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, came to the judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the brother of the mayor royal; so in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Office agent attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the bookmaker was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the 197/2011 file, legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and thereafter no claim may be made about the process that was followed; besides that you will not be required to redress for harm or punishment.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmaker, at around 15:50 Larrazabal Breton was ordered to be immediately released.
The clerk of the Court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be filed.
It will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where Secretary of the Governorate, Francisco Blake, and seven others lost their lives
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where Secretary of the Governorate, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven others lost their lives indicate that the helicopter was directly impacted on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a crash landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact zone did not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search they report that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the research can last several months, it could even reach one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, general manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was operating at cruising speed and that this happened on upward soft ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact," he said.
At the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations the flight was performed under the rules of visual flight, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and terrain.
Weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM located conditions suitable for take-off, as the aircraft moved towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, there were layers of cloudiness at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the cloud conditions the crew has sought an area of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft match, probably before impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight, side path.
The aircraft's pattern of debris dispersion suggests that the helicopter was hit on the ground under structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion detected:
At the site of the accident, no evidence is revealed in the ship's remains of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9 thousand 200 feet above the middle sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was expected to be disjointed along that route.
The information provides elements that suggest that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the cordoned-off site, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found around the accident, strengthening the presumption that the impact was presented under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find obesity gene
He leads Social Security research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is leading research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of Childhood and Adolescent Obesity' protocol, which will allow markers associated with being overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialty Hospital of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research is invited to participate the population whether or not they are entitled, go to the participating sports units of IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to the minors, every Saturday from 8:00 hours.
He emphasized that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (State of Mexico Poniente) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (State of Mexico East).
Once the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
At the time of World Diabetes Day on 14 November, he stated that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be asked about physical activity and history of disease families, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, size, waist circumference), blood pressure intake, determination of glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin and genetic levels are applied to all participants (genes that are associated with childhood obesity are sought).
Cruz López noted that this research is due to the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
'The 1999 and 2006 health surveys indicated that in just six years there was an increase, for boys, of 77 per cent in obesity, and girls 47 per cent; in terms of overweight there was also a dramatic rise,' the IMSS specialist said.
It indicated that the justification for finding the markers was based on the country's population differing from others by their genetic history.
On average, Mexican has 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translate into the inability to burn the excess energy that we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of children, which allows to detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said the presence of dark folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic and even prediabete alterations.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors give it in writing to parents, who are explained each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is lack of daily physical activity, stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e. the increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) high in fats and proteins and the genetics discussed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM's Faculty of Chemistry, develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a better-performing mixture, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals sent by the pavement were taken care of, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand potholes each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, warned, who ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate , potholes could be reduced in quantity or even eliminated altogether.
At his conference A technological view of potholes, given in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, released that the laboratory in charge develops polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphalt, and others of low molecular weight, called malthenos, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that on the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt folder, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that makes up the folder, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, it allows the forces to spread very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt they would spread even better, the chemical engineer opined.
Above the asphalt folder, abounded, is placed a last layer called a rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, an sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with vehicle tires, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt folder and provide friction along the way.
Being the part of the pavement that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the rolling folder also requires to be of the right thickness and care must be taken of the material from which it is made.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the terrain gets wet, the water diffuses inside the folder and is difficult to get out, causing a softening of all layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the tread film and only after the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but is a process that should be taken care of the first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the pavement must always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is met, to prevent potholes from forming frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to research and work on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow to repair potholes easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valley candidate lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna not reaching the crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th princess title.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire for the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the winners' podium, wearing the silver crown and the band that credit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and scepter, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979) , Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pine Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask themselves is What was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation proved that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of police and Best Jolie Face of Vogue, titles that obtained queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Leamos Literary Cart.
At the inter-bankruptcy the Vallecaucana replied:
"I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it's a way of culturalizing, I definitely think the book that marked me as a childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a pretty deep book.
Currently I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we must all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Burning of Blood".
An answer that little was first liked by the term "culturalize" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he quoted has marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina stated feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise no matter what has to happen.
And for all people, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the hypotheses launched is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotano journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who took all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on stage."
And that was noticed in his first swimsuit performance on the Hilton beach and his two parades at the coronation evening.
Although both looked safe, it was noted that she lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic did demonstrate.
Ariel Osorio, journalist for the program "Como en casa", of the RCN Channel opined that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "verifies that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the contest does not remain as queen".
Besides, Valle showed himself to the last very elusive with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
For some reason, two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before entering the Contest they are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the melting and fibrosis that was noticeable in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the healthiest body, good diet and responsible physical work.
Queens' preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth for me was not very noticeable, lowered points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos considers that vallecaucana's mistake was the surgical interventions that were performed.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body was never her forte and here she was charged."
For this award, which for the first time delivers the National Beauty Competition, after the swimsuit parade a cruel vaticinium emerged that last night was fulfilled, as this was said to be the contentment that Raymundo gave Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international contests by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, was dodging her crown.
So was the work of the caleño who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4th a CTI lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the Farc's top boss: "Alfonso Cano", through the matching of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists working in the CTI section, that week it was the turn of "availability" to Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the start of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to enter for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lophoscopy, which is the study of frictional skin, that is, the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to wear clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for you.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected of being from the man leading the world's oldest guerrillas, so he was asked to carry the decadactilar card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site where the body was located, he did not recognize him for his physical appearance, as he was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the body's fingerprints to those on the card.
His eye did not fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the chief of the Farc.
In search of the footprint
For a dactyloscopist of the Sikhín de Cali, President Juan Manuel Santos' recognition of Eliazar González, at the press conference for the operative against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can become key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, lophoscopists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present fake cards or do not have papers.
We take the fingerprint and look for them in the database.
The investigator recounted that, in a robbery case, he had to remove a piece of wall from a house, as there the thief had rested his hand to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the print from the whole hand and identify the offender, who had been involved in different thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also rule out or reassert suspects in murder cases.
They recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a relative could be a suspect in the crime and, indeed, a print on the bottle matched.
Although this doesn't guarantee it was the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI fingerprinter explained that in objects "fingerprints are taken out with chemical or physical reagents".
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Logging.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He clarified that not everything is as shown on the TV show CSI.
Just as not everything that shines is gold, not everything you touch becomes a mark.
However, if it can be used, if the respective check is performed.
The "outraged" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square for camping.
A large part served the eviction order and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, Manhattan Square from where they were evicted in the early hours of the morning and trying to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters crowded off Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access thanks to a court order that allows the "outraged" to camp again at the site, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been further arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the square, we're going to settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations," said one of the spokesmans for the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the "outraged" response to the eviction of his camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation of the site and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "outraged" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the confluence of downtown Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which linkes New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church Parish.
For at least an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already moved in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned precinct - is still closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
Some of the protesters displaced there carried and distributed copies of that court order at this hour and even handed them over to the officers guarding the square, prompting "some small clashes," said Bray, who reported that some officers beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evicting Members of Occupy Wall Street or applying "laws that were published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from re-accessing the park with shops or other properties they previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg indicated to the press that, because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
The councilor personally defended the early-morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and decided because the protesters were "breaking the law."
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm others", since "some businesses had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"This morning's eviction was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of American workers," added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "disrespecting freedom of expression."
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street" also indicated that they plan to organize "great actions" by Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests lasted, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Alongside Michael Bublé and other Canadian highlights, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a lifeguard on "Baywatch", a bunny from "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" (baladist) Michael Bublé and other Canadian highlights, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st bringing to life a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a home pornographic video in which she appears along with her then-husband, the drummer of "M'tley Cr'e", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a manger a doll representing Jesus.
On the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and which is no stranger to controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian "slut" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan reborn after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the fall spiral that began in March
Since last March, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, still convalescing by the devastating earthquake that has caused a nuclear crisis, the japanese country's worst catastrophe since World War II.
The Tokyo government's first estimates amounted to $300 billion in material losses, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, gross domestic product data between July and September served as a page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The record in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the highest rate of growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the uptick in the purchase of machinery to restore earthquake-ravaged areas and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared with the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first setback after six months of uninterrupted rises.
However, the true revulsive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use the gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the euro area debt crisis and the murky U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a ste on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September on the yen price.
While markets continue their siege on the EU's peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda's government does not let its guard down.
"We must be vigilant about the remaining risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand's floods, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," Economic Policy Secretary Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-oron (OECD) stated that most member countries in September showed sharper signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator that anticipates turning points in the world economy highlighted that major powers are slowing down.
Since it dropped four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 August.
The euro area even below average, which is at level 100, with eight tenths to 99.13 points precipitating.
Athens re-feeds doubts
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums fired and uncertainty reinstalled in the parquets, Greece continues to get in the labyrinth leading to the exit of europe's great debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenist transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by genuine conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed with facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed in his appointment may fall short to implement them, conservative party leader New Democracy Antonis Samaras assured that he will not support further austerity measures under any circumstances and reiterated his demand for new elections by schedule , on February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said at the opening yesterday of a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not clear up doubts about his stance: "We are committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and IMF, the agencies that must unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that it will not give its go-ahead to any letter of commitment to meet the adjustments.
But the European Commission, which is still chosen by the impact of the ordago of papandreu's referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "an unambiguous written commitment and as soon as possible."
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8 billion, although there is also no final date.
The Greek skein still has thread for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "predominant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading place worldwide in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in these last two decades the second donor of the pose in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" she noted is to be an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
Yesterday the Queen inaugurated the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations with the horizon of 2015, and, "especially, in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living on lower than a daily dollar , setting the "poverty threshold".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and takes on this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate at the Summit, which will continue until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women" , main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements achieved" and "many challenges we face."
The Microcredit Summit is raised not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Her Majesty explained that 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these households will be 175 and that one hundred million of these households will leave the poverty line they are in.
The impetus in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, highlighted Doña Sofía as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "in all I have seen the continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the qualifier of the "head of household" gathered in Valladolid by the "baquero of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic bonanza, as it was a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez considered microcredits to be "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty," and now "more than ever" developed-country governments must work under criteria of solidarity and not let poverty fall victim to cuts.
For Spain, microcredit consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to people "excluded from whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian-Democratic party.
The future of Europe had not initially been included on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy militants who consider government policy to be currently too unre strict with the Greeks and could be too strict with the Italians in the future.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes were recorded against and ten abstentions were recorded.
The standing ovation of several minutes that were won, with his interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schsuble, the Europhile Minister of Finance, clear up any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summarized in a motto: the response to the crisis "is no less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe brings peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come to make its way in Europe."
This could be expressed in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give Europe a face".
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schouble.
It is certainly unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly reach agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by a crushing majority the proposal to weigh each country's weight of the European Central Bank's directive on the weight of each economy, which would obviously reinforce Germany's weight.
Eager to calm her spirits within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is also not that he has tried to win over his congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel has not lied to France.
Except in passing.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of sick leave fraud
Following the subsidies, the UMP and the Government are embarking on an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a box responsible for family allowances and give a speech on the subject, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
Moreover, to accompany such an offensive, which is part of the willingness to save rigorously, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose a fourth day of deprivation on private sector workers before they can take the downfall.
In short, unless there is a specific enterprise agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days' salary, i.e. a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could lift a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants a day of unpaid deprivation in the event of a leave of absence (so far, they have no shortage, compared to the three days that apply in the private sector).
As these issues are being discussed, most also put the issue of fraud, this time geared towards abuses of work losses, on the table.
"Controls are going to be significantly increased and, moreover, if someone is discovered committing fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts," Xavier Bertrand warned by speaking on RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of down-work fraud.
Indeed, this issue has been constantly monitored since 2002 and a number of political offensives have been launched that have normally paid off.
The French get sick only in the rest of Europe.
Let us take a close look at the national figures first.
According to the French Institute for Social Security (CNAM), more than EUR 237 million in low-working benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, the subsidies for casualties accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, amounting to EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% correspond to maternity and accident leave, while 54% are related to sick leave, amounting to EUR 6.2 billion.
Consequently, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off work, up from 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that undoubtedly hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by Syrian professional management Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken a single day off from sickness.
Another study, in this case of Maladie Assurance, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave lasted less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% were longer.
Compared to our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than in other areas to catch sick leave.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate of work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a fairly limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has made sick leave controls of more than 45 days systematic.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million inspections, CNAM found, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term casualties were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11% of cases were considered to be "properly adapted or unjustified; a figure that, starting at a total of 1.2 million, amounts to 132,000.
As a result, a total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases are reached among several million workers who took sick leave.
Undoubtedly, a negligible figure compared, for example, to black work.
According to UMP Mp Dominique Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between EUR 9 billion and EUR 15 billion per year, that is, more than the total cost of leave subsidies and certainly considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Let's say: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece is going to need a new adjustment plan to straighten its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared to Parliament on Monday, 14 November; he also added that the hundred days granted to his Union Government would not be sufficient to achieve that objective.
"In order to make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who delivered his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, since the country's stay in the euro area is "at stake", he added.
As a result, Papadémos has forecast that the country's public deficit will shrink "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed on Monday his support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for further action," he said during a meeting with members of his "New Democracy" party.
It agreed with the objectives of deficit and debt reduction, as well as the fight against waste, but against any policy that impeded economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without a written guarantee of all parties' support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras has replied that his word would suffice and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live denying death, says Royal Society of Canada report
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
It is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from various fields, including ethics, legal and physician.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient considers such an option and has been competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent Economist Intelligence Unit survey that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death."
On medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada indicate.
And even though most Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this regard is recorded by Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions that do not coincide with the federal government's position, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Penal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not caused an abuse of their application, that is, the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with non-competent persons or that they have not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday by teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, pro-euthanasia
Let us remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow people whose near death would alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
In addition, 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not imply that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
For people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or discontinuation of healthcare for a patient, the situation is not as clear, as indicated by the report's authors.
In addition, its recommendations suggest that it should be stated in the Penal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The committee of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient rejects end-of-life care without fear of dealing with a complaint.
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and physicians to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canada's health institutions, the committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations regarding the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" the position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to the terminally ill.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and over 18 can ask for help committing suicide," says Deschamps, who yesterday consulted a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value of society.
However, it adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she described as "manifest in favour of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, especially calls into question the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's king urges President El Asad to give up power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
Bachar El Asad's partisans demonstrated yesterday to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Bachar El Assad's Syria intensified, with Russia's support, resisting and denouncing that there is a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League's suspension of Syria, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighboring Syria, have spoken in favour of President Assad's abandonment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bachar El Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where a quarantine of civilians and members of regime forces has already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, said in an interview for the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that Turkey's mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in a failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will depart," he said, alluding to Syria, a neighboring country in which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has welcomed the "strengthening of consensus against Asad and the regime's actions" of Syria.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking an increasingly tough tone" on repression in Syria, says Mark Toner, State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have already been killed in the Deraa region of southern Syria, as announced by the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights (DSBH).
Two other civilians have died "during shelling and shootings with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, the NGO says.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem believes that the country is "moving towards the end of the crisis."
In addition, it has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its functions, which it believes is "a dangerous step".
Syria will "not falter," he added, ensuring that "plotted plots against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently considering a "civilian protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the crackdown on the regime that he believes is locked in "paranoia."
A new extraordinary League meeting is scheduled to take place tomorrow in Rabat to implement the exit plan for the crisis adopted on 2 November, which provides, in particular, for the withdrawal of the armed forces from opposition-held cities and the release of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday judged the Arab League's decision as "wrong," while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan for the crisis, although it did not express its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks Italians for time and sacrifices
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner debated political parties yesterday and today he met with trade unions and employers.
It should form a relatively restricted cabinet, made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has talked about a comprehensive programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, having met with the President of the Appointed Council.
For his part, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he hoped that Mario Monti would request a vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of stock markets and bonditians yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a government and prepare its agenda, he stressed, adding that he is "sure that markets will be patient and understand it."
Its appointment by the President initially welcomed the markets, but then the concern was imposed, particularly following an unforeseen decline in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should set up a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians."
The new Government will have to operate until 2013, the date of the forthcoming legislation, it believes.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get Parliament's vote of confidence by Friday.
Monti is committed to the urgentness and the aim of Italy "regaining its prominence" in Europe when he takes office.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of achieving a budgetary balance in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigour measures.
Italian "chief of chiefs" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him the mattes, also stressed the need to boost the economy, "since a country that is not growing cannot respect deficit requirements."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy," according to the publishers.
The great unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid an early election, since Italy has to place around EUR 200 billion in state obligations by April 2012.
Russian scientist has collaborated with Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the INTERNATIONAL agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
His company's economic problems would have led him to contact the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
He was later believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, as reported by a Member State to the Agency, worked for most of his career in nuclear technology in his home country's military nuclear program."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by about 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, over the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, statistics published by the FBI on Monday indicate.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49%, compared to a 13% increase in acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of crimes and crimes against religious.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, the FBI says.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that such crimes and crimes have increased again," the human rights organization Human Rights First said, "the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds one head of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and should strive to end such abuses," he adds, considering that such efforts could include improved police reports on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site on Monday modified the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which makes their service look a little more like Facebook's.
A new "activity" tab and another so-called "name" allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Tweets", that is, those internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or that follow you.
This lets you know if they track messages, whether they are credited to new accounts, whether they rate a message as a favorite, and so on.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told the AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its non-instinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi to a public plus large avec a maniement plus comparable to celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users have suddenly debated "tweets" with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
"It's useless, it's invasive and it looks too much like Facebook," he writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature is going to help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introducing a budget "golden rule" in the Constitution
The large-coalition Social Democratic/Christian Democrat Government in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the Constitution a budgetary "golden rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus prevent a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when The Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, well above the ceiling of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced on a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3 billion euros more in interest each year," said The Christian Democrat Vice-Chancellor for Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to euro area member countries on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of reducing the public deficit and recovering the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in a Law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, as of 2017, the federal state's structural public deficit should not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states, as well as communes, should submit balanced budgets.
The aim is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historical highs that produced the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been gradually dating back since then, driven by purchases from investors who consider it a "safe value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was re-traded on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has fallen below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those that led to the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was traded at around 120 yen and the euro to more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency harms the archipelago's exports by making Made in Japan products more profitable and reducing the value of foreign revenues by Japanese companies when converted into the domestic currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the Earthquake and Tsunami of March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region of northeastern Africa, Noda said, fearing that the yen's face-to-root is the weak recovery.
The world's third-largest economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of disaster-affected households.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect Japan's "economic foundations."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures," implying that greater monetary flexibility should not be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury Bills by five trillion yen (47 billion euros), bringing to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of funds devoted to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro Area:
guys grow up, bags falter
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakest countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European stock exchanges sink a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and is 3,064 points away.
Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and London by 0.1%.
"Given the new tensions in relation to loan yields from the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world continue to yield some of their recent profits."
"Investors, nervous, are well aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, cited by Reuters agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange has closed with a 0.7% fall, renewing market players' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place in a small margin of variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The reappearance of concerns about the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to come down on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the runners, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met at Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that provides, in particular, for the option of a struggling country leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions regarding the interest rates of southern countries, but also France, continue to fuel the fears of interveners.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main work" of his Government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in spread between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
Statistically, France has recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a more favourable figure than the expected 0.3%, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised the figure in the second quarter down, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
Moreover, it is the fourth quarter that really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts should be worth more than dogmas
If there is one issue that cannot be dealt with considering short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate for an electoral meeting to be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if you study all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, demographic developments will double electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the growing scarcity of fossil resources will need to be alleviated to continue producing electricity continuously, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear power.
That is not the case either of Belgium, which subjects its own to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor of Switzerland, which is only intended to build next-generation power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, move forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a interrupted power plant following the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is sometimes presented as an example, reality goes against such discourse.
Berlin's election is going to lead to an increase in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on the increased need for imported gas, particularly from Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal-fired power plants.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticed.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
European champion in the wind sector, from which he obtains 30% of his electricity, he is also one of the great users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, their CO2 emissions and the price of their electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility in the national territory, French companies benefit from Europe's cheapest electricity.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would detract from the wonderful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express opposition in principle to this type of energy, as the polls show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has lost building an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widely export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets that can create non-relocatable jobs.
If France were to decide to abandon nuclear power, it would mean the slaughter of much of these SMEs and the loss of EUR 6 billion per year in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to run sixty years, when its manufacturer's collapse is planned?
To solve the nuclear energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source either.
Areva's development of low-CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear power, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, that of Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not have consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to reactor design and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented reach, which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, just as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to this progress and cooperation between the security authorities, and the French and German operators and builders, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is being studied by all the electrical actors who wish to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for areva and EDF competitors, as it would set them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has made headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see the Libération newspaper of 23 May) proclaiming from the past that France "does not need foreign talent, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The point is that, on this subject, there is quite a lot of consensus between left and right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the tone by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country with about two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was set by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both left and right shared fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with regard to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande merely includes banalities, stating that co-development will allow the "migration problem" to be solved.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be profitable electorally, but economically it comes out very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that immigrants can replace domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, by pushing for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that immigrants are actually rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly practice professions in under-employment sectors.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for staff.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would struggle to work in a country that lacks anaesthetists, complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of nationals to positively influence the wages and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri estimated that a 1% increase in migration flows represents an increase in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, regardless of the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to brainstorming and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies such as Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, providing on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150,000 to public budgets on average throughout his or her life.
At the beginning of his tenure, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go look for the growth points he lacked "with his teeth".
These teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the reverse effect.
Europe invented democracy, it just needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon the Little One, that it was something thought out.
Universal suffrage, while a necessary condition for democracy, is not enough on its own and can even become an "instrument of oppression," as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are living in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be reflected on in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers no longer make good progress.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a vacuum stop of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to take blows of effect, but a common exercise, in full, calm and continuous, of choices and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to finish the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that folds under the orders of markets and rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers from a humiliation in the international sphere.
We care about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty regains the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare their future through investment.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having long fought against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
So be it.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and lead us to a new s leading point.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Interest-Motivated Revolution would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let's make Europeans.
"Non-contact" chip cards are generalized
The World Chip Card Show starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart cabinet calculations.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for joint transportation or purchases simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the non-contact payment sector.
Around 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are more modest: 400,000 visa cards are being used without contact.
But large areas work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
To get the top gear in, however, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"There are two large French establishments that have committed to systematically spreading bank cards equipped with the contactless system among their customers in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, MANAGING Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks prove mobile phone payment
But it is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, indispensable for transactions.
"They're lagging behind."
"But I should finally experience a real boom next year."
"We anticipate that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And société générale also stated yesterday that it is preparing to market an offer that allows its customers to pay contactlessly through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Links between the Al Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the long-suspected Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers already "has certainty."
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the catwalks.
Abducted in a restaurant in Niamey by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of calls made indicates to several partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers particularly captured the interest of the researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "supports" had become increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and discourses or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikazes or explosive devices in the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since been pressuring Abuja to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened people unworthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin"), it incites the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants launch into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are first and for all oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active and attacks on police stations multiplied.
Abuja's reaction was, as is often the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has been radicalized and abandons its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claims an attack that causes 80 dead in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram strikes Abuja again, particularly against the police-protected headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, ranging from Mauritania to Somalia to Nigeria, unsettles all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and stated that he was willing to "share all the information."
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, Iran and with the help of Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican candidates for presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more thunderous statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point for Republicans.
The slogans, often unfounded, about China, Iran, aid to Israel are extended.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate on the grand old party designation, has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and denounce them "for currency manipulation," a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of their sector to Asia.
It doesn't matter if that involves the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate who possesses a sophisticated view of foreign policy, nearly drowned in the face of an attitude that "overwhelms" emotions.
He has called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Reagan-style
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
"If I get elected, I'll stop Iran," he bragged.
"If Obama gets re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing with his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-high-ranked candidate, shows an embarrassing disrecognise of such issues.
Recently, he called for countering china's military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capability," apparently ignoring the fact that China has already had the military atom since 1964.
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The resort to torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also called Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with 2008 Republican nominee John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents of the current President reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty exit of Iraq's boys and their misrepresentations in Libya, and label it weak.
But attacks aren't easy for them.
The population rather positively judges Obama's national security balance, which wiped out Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is wary of military interventions that lead to a sinking.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being fairer.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea fund, has already been put into service.
You must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated on the Baltic shores, between the orchestra's music and a delicate law firm, at the opening of the Nord Stream, the new pipeline that directly connects Russia with Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart in the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe through a first of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012 which will provide a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, i.e. sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge work presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land course by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to shut it down by closing access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact," in reference to hitler-Stalin's alliance to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has achieved greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Energy Europe, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has been able, in just five years, to make its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, large gas consumers and increasingly limited reserves triumph.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unies us organically," Francois Fillon confirmed during the pipeline's opening, demonstrating the extent to which the big contracts in the gas sector are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom's managers, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater tube is made of cement-coated steel to protect against ship anchors.
It rests at the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m deep.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"It was necessary to withdraw or destroy a hundred of them, as a precaution," says Jens Muller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extreme measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs like 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: neither by valves nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was envisaged in the waters of Sweden, but project managers resigned from it by seeing that the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state-owned society to settle permanently at sea off its coast.
"In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Muller.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But builders find a leak unlikely, as they have planned joints that are expected to leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, which performs external inspections, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
In the shape of a cigar, it is inserted into the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline has been designed to run for fifty years without any repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by Germany's E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as The Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint company, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to that company, for a renewable twenty-five-year period, all gas transport capabilities.
"Gazprom will be paid for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported," says Jens Muller.
Pipeline construction financing has been carried out by 30% by shareholder input and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, as Gazprom assumes the risk of expenses on its own.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors are in place to measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas upon arrival, before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back a taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its leaves broken white, as aged by time.
However, Moleskine notebooks with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to release a book of design notes, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant to the company, was in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the stool.
This type of notebook was highly valued by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to today's taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the twentieth century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Gone is the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer's profile, as the notebook attracts both businessmen, students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-spirited and educated.
The small Italian company, which had twelve workers in its early days, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the center of the cities, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural firm goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard caps, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: handbags, agendas, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envy: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The XV Week for the Employment of the Disabled begins today.
Despite a resolute public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Daunting?
"No," says Eric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made since fifteen years is considerable.
"Back then, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, much remains to be done."
It is worth mentioning that the disabled unemployed continue to face numerous barriers to access to employment.
They are usually older: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished high school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that make it especially difficult to return to the world of work and that "constitute the cru shred of the problem," says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; people's mindset moves forward, but too slowly.
An April study by the ASSOCIATION IMS-Entreprendre for cité noted that the directors surveyed have "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual deficient".
The result: private companies with more than 20 workers are a long way from the goal of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating back to 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
"We now reach around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of establishments "subject to this contribution", as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has created a lot of pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects true awareness, particularly among large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 workers have disabled employees in their workforce, compared to 82% of companies between 100 and 199 workers.
Hazard: "A Joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens don't hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We dare not say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other, on the stand of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made peace.
Five months after his striker's gesture of grudge against Turkey, the Belgian nationalist has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for his progress and because he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," Lille's striker replies.
As for the contrast between his performances on his team and in the selection, "it is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all year round, which does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to get in position."
Called up to play Against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine".
Not forgetting the "pleasure".
He has been cheering for the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been his fan," he says.
That will certainly reinforce especially the "particular" nature of the meeting.
Especially since he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", remember.
"We just faced each other recently.
"Playing against them is always a joy."
Leekens has simply referred to "pride."
"Pride" for playing "a gala match."
"Pride" also to see, as a "neighbor", that France "returns to be a very high-level team", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job," he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be happy to be able to share a plane with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he said.
"We are building something; players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You'll be able to see it in the next few games." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows a lot of confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal is facing with great optimism the back match against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Seleccao, which he has been running since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a match to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Considering the first leg (0-0), on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems clear that things are not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, yes, but failed to score the valuable goal that would have given it peace of mind.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored away from home."
But at home, at Lisbon's bright Stadium of Light, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of an audience that should be just as excited, even if it is clear that the match "is very evenly matched", dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We hope the match is very evenly matched, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012," carlos Queiroz's successor has nevertheless relativized.
Friday's tie in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
Bosnians could get a tie, though they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we haven't scored away from home," Bento laments.
"We're going to play against a team that has great technical quality and has players with great individual quality," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the beginning, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "leave them no time to think".
A good idea, as long as, this time, it's realistic.
