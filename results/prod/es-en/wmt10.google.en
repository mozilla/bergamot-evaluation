Barack Obama will be the fourth US president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth US president in history.
You will receive the diploma, the medal and the check for 1.4 million dollars, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time he will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple are scheduled to meet with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive him, although the third to receive him in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will discuss the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid such an issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts were further increased by the dispatch of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check for ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
You plan to donate them for charitable purposes, but have not yet decided to which specific organization.
During its comprehensive program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the award.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not fully deserving it.
Likewise, he repeated several times that the award is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he mentioned that it represents &quot;a challenge to take action.&quot;
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police charged the president of the civic association Společnost ochránců přírody Litoměřice (Litoměřice Nature Defenders Society) with blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded money from investors for their own benefit, said Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The president of the Litoměřice Nature Defenders Society is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno is not very fond of containers to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in southern Moravian villages you can find trash containers everywhere.
And in Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to claim that in Brno rubbish is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, for being the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of rubbish, not only due to the fact that we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to drop a PET bottle into the right container in the center?
It is almost impossible, especially it requires a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské náměstí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues not be angry with me, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to mention, it is not easy to separate garbage elsewhere, either.
That is why many of my friends prefer not to separate it.
For vagrancy
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I&#39;m not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn&#39;t see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, by going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing from the container.
It&#39;s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn&#39;t it ?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the socialists of Brno much.
They prefer to buy the hockey extra league from the city, which shames us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I&#39;m glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the internet a bit, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
The &quot;Paroubek&quot; budget took money from rents and health benefits
After the left, despite the government&#39;s opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, sickness benefits or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt everyone who governs in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they relied on the government to subsequently borrow for sensitive expenses, rents, or sickness benefits. &quot;That is just putting off the problems for the future, it is laying mines,&quot; says Janota.
What happens is that, when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to pay the money back.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If you do not reduce social benefits or state operating expenses, you have to increase taxes.
Everyone the left added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, his children too.
People don&#39;t have to worry about rents or health benefits, they will receive them. 1.8 billion of these accounts disappeared.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year not only 163,000 million will be missing in the treasury, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and it will no longer be possible to increase VAT slightly or reduce maternity allowances, as the government did in its package against the deficit.
Due to the dislocation of money to the benefit of some constituencies, next year there will also be five billion missing to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced either.
The best you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomonic solution to the decrease in funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly owned by the state, and it will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year ČEZ allocated 18 billion to the budget.
Each year of the dividends ecological damages are settled, they serve to complete the account for the rents or they serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the rents.
Furthermore, with this trick, according to EU rules, the true budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The money transfer carnival does not end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant various compensation to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is not clear whether the state will need such funds.
It is a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
Afterwards, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, draw on the reserve of the government budget.
There is also a hundred million missing for the Státní pokladna (State Bank) project, whose price is two billion and which has already been started. It should allow you to monitor online what the different authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister cannot find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and penalties will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to run on two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, at the press of a key, switch between various operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With the press of a key, they go from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizer software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the company VMware in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and several days ago it was demonstrated for the first time.
It will be released in 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is no longer fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems work, Windows Mobile and Android, at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
The company VMware cooperates with the European and American operators to test the virtualization of smartphones and these phones will reach customers during the year 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only ski lift maintainers in Krkonoše are concerned about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow means that people do not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That is why in Krkonoše you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas Eve and New Year&#39;s Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the offers, check the prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, if this Christmas there will be snow or mud, &quot;mentioned the maintainer of the Spindl.Info information portal Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year&#39;s Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn according to their expectations, should not hesitate to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put quality of accommodation second can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in Špindlerův Mlýn mainly offer weekly stays for New Year&#39;s Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the vacant rooms will sell out quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a Vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some last minute Christmas breaks, &quot;mentioned Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year&#39;s Eve in Krkonoše as well, but there are fewer free places.
They also sell very well the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is hurt by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will be sold out as well, &quot;says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a bit easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We are about five percent better.
For New Year&#39;s Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well, &quot;reported the manager of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year&#39;s Eve stays are already taken at the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the newest hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we are at approximately sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the Omnia hotel manager.
However, at the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkonoše will be out of the snow waiting.
Temperatures should drop on Thursday and if there is rainfall, it should snow in the mountains.
But then temperatures will rise again, reported Jiří Jakubský de Hradec Králové of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats on the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the most foolish.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase &quot;as in Iraq&quot; used multiple times in the same text, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush&#39;s January 2007 statement for his own statement: &quot;A new way forward.&quot;
It was he himself who three years ago criticized Bush&#39;s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war. And that he criticized as &quot;an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.&quot;
The following months, however, demonstrated that Bush&#39;s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is nothing in the news about Iraq.
Bush&#39;s reputation did not improve, yet objectively he left his successor in a much more favorable starting position than might have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite traditional subordinate relationships, subjected indecisive riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but could not think of anything better, so at least he deceived the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the entire Obama strategy seems to be his goal, to begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this procedure in three years. The entire Obama doctrine generated more questions than the answers it offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the Iraq procedure.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is honored.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing their chief every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin people. Behind him will remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily difficult due to the confused relationships, further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even setting a state that is &quot;capable of action&quot;, a minimal goal of the entire operation, doesn&#39;t seem very real.
The horizon of Obama&#39;s strategy collides with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now on the verge of exploding.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to &quot;come home soon&quot; will perform some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and do not want to explain to their constituents, what connection the security of Germany or Italy has to the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will spell a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential elections are three years away and that is why there is still a long time to find another strategy, if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
The top executives of the US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold for a minimum period of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn in the event that they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longer path it has to take, said former JPMorgan bank investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after setting aside nearly $ 17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, will probably exceed, despite the measure announced today, 20,000 million dollars.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to levy a 50% tax on bank bonuses in excess of £ 25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000) in one fell swoop.
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record number, received this year&#39;s Nobel Prizes from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden in Stockholm today, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, also appeared among the winners.
The Nobel Prize in medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in chemistry was received by the Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize awarded, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each winner collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to SEK 10 million (approximately CZK 25 million).
In the case of having several winners in each category, the prize is distributed among themselves.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel, that of Peace, was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he recognized the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his permanence in the government, since he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the chamber of deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota&#39;s tenure in the cabinet as well, are supposed to be the topics of their meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis in public finances.
President Radim Ochvat&#39;s spokesman reported on the appointment.
On his permanence in office, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The chamber of deputies, however, on Wednesday approved the left&#39;s proposals for fund transfers and increased money for civil servants&#39; salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, since they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious internal political conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer&#39;s bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and the Party of the Greens, are becoming controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of savings measures, imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; Today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had been neglecting &quot;the serious problem&quot; for a long time, that is, &quot;the unsustainable deficit&quot; of public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, says the president.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words &quot;strong sentences&quot;.
ČSSD chief Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government. It will exceed 200,000 million crowns.
On Wednesday ČSSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular ones were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood&#39;s new movie, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say the starring roles are played by American actors.
The story talks about sports, race relations, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the Republic of South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said: &quot;When I interpret you, I will have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood&#39;s boxing drama Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the slavery abolition movement, which ended up being a slave, to the fictional President of the USA, and even of God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, for many people, he is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the Republic of South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help bring the country together. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is capable of uniting his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong to the outsiders in the world.
The South African team manages to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman spent several years getting the Mandela story into theaters.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was speaking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
Most importantly, he wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I discovered that by squeezing your hand, I receive your energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
Trying to become a different person is important to me.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: &quot;In the movie I look much taller.&quot;
Despite the obvious differences between the actors&#39; characters and their actual models, and under director Eastwood&#39;s management, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is talk of Oscar ambitions as well.
Daily Variety magazine film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: &quot;It was a very good story, a very well made movie.&quot;
In movie reviews on the rottentomatoes.com website, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
Over Norway a special light effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Russian Defense Ministry ended up acknowledging yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested an ICBM.
The launch failed again. The &quot;Bulava&quot; -type missile, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even their repeated presence in missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly off or there was a failure in the air.
In the Russian newspapers they write of &quot;Bulava&quot; as of &quot;a missile that does not fly&quot;.
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there were no problems at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time &quot;Bulava&quot; was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a ship that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed &quot;Bulava&quot;.
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by affirming that one cannot simply speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile held and the failure occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines broke down immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely without errors, according to the Ministry of Defense management only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and that is why they continue to affirm that &quot;Bulavá&quot; will one day fly without problems and that it will even manage to carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will appear again at the age of 51 at a professional hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his team CSKA Moscow and possibly play in KHL&#39;s duel against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov ended his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practices and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to sort out some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the Moscow club&#39;s coach, as saying.
It is still unclear whether the famous player&#39;s return will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the oldest professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, for the entire season, and had 15 goals and 26 assists.
The eldest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canadian Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he was also successful in the NHL: playing for Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai met the requirements of the unions. Will cancel all supplementary work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all extra work.
Precisely because of the frequent overtime work, the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants this year to agree with the unions one more Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will work in two shifts, said Vaněk.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the supplementary work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime hours or they can take a day off on December 28, that is, extend the Christmas holidays by one day, said Vaněk.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because overtime work was the most urgent and problematic point of comments and complaints from unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all supplemental work for the month of December. Vaněk mentioned.
Employees at the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they pledged to meet the requirements and the document was signed, they were ready to cancel the emergency strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over frequent side jobs.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
Management was of the opinion that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their declaration of the strike emergency on Monday, also demanded that none of the employees, who stopped manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
When it comes to extra work, the unions demand that the company keep it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in Nošovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Mass production was started last November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the &#39;calloused&#39; HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs already available.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, the life of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If virus replication is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all drugs used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work the scientists find new, &#39;improved&#39; compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the albumin of the virus.
Metallocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are linked by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
The HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protease, splitting of the HIV virus does not occur and mature, infectious virus corpuscles would not be created.
If we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient&#39;s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease was carried out in a test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of metallocarborans in the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect in resistant variants, in which the drugs often do not work.
The unique effect mechanism, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metallocarborans are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the Structural Biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he fights back
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for next year is &quot;appalling&quot; and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say that time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Nečas, the prime minister has to decide whether in the chamber of deputies he wants to rely on the minority, who are trying to fight against the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and social democration towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Nečas warned.
The chamber of deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however with the amending proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The chamber of deputies increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the ODS proposals, since they cover up the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS left the room before the vote and thus fulfilled the government&#39;s wish, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and worthlessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and the feeling of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened resignation in the event of approval of the modifying proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out, that he is thinking of staying in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do those nominated by the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, if he will resign, if the chamber passes other laws that increase the deficit, for example those that refer to subsidies in sickness, rent, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not to blame
It&#39;s the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the news text from the US.
He recalled that in various ministries in the positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the fight with the height of the deficit of the public finances, &quot;it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is supported by the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies.&quot;
However, this way he will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the ODS members.
I have not thought about that, when the time is right, I will deal with it, Defense Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by ODS members, told reporters in the chamber of deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon went out to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
ODS relented at the prime minister&#39;s request
Nečas stressed, that ODS on Wednesday in the chamber of deputies would probably vote against the modified budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask the deputies of ODS to allow acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, he reacted to the question, if ODS does not care about the absence of the head of the party in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the budget negotiations.
I did not realize that my vote was missing.
When he resigned from the mandate he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the Bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new ČD train schedule, fewer trains will run for almost the same fares
České dráhy (Czech Railways) from December 13 will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, will reinforce some links.
The total extent of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule takes effect.
Most rates including basic and customer prices will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, dráhy for this line they will add a pendolino highway.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not circulate to Bratislava again.
Fewer fast trains will run on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the direct Prague - Letohrad links will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line will also be canceled and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only some weekdays.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change at Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15. line of the Esko system, in the outskirts of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at the Praga Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will run every two hours.
From December 13, travelers will no longer travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The bill for regional railways this year: 200 million more than before
The fast trains are commissioned and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses, Dráhy will receive four billion crowns in total next year, the same as this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local dráhy trains they have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always one year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps that is why they did not increase the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will only take place on the one-day tickets - ČD Net and on the cheap eLiška internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card, the ČD Net price will increase from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiška will depend on the distance, until now there was the single price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Filipino gunmen continue to detain more than 50 people, children were released
The armed men have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several students from a primary school and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 hostages.
All 17 detained children and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the Agusan del Sur province.
They say that approximately 19 armed men use the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed men belong to the New People&#39;s Army (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police previously pursued the kidnappers due to violence, which was caused by the settlement of scores between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor&#39;s elections, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, they arrested the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on the island of Mindanao.
However, on Tuesday they renewed the peace talks with the Philippine government.
The RSA story is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the next few days a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (its official title in Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), which captures a part of the biography of the former president of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela, will be released in US cinemas.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, who years ago was chosen for the title role by Mandela himself.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela. He was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for freedom of thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk&#39;s, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
great hopes, since it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world championship in soccer are culminating in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the lead roles by &quot;uninteresting&quot; Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman however says, that he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well for it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as they say - charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it&#39;s good, if through the movie we can remember Mandela&#39;s character and message.
It is a story from the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to the whole world, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first electoral presidential term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long years separated. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he, as the protagonist, also dons the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won the world cup at the time.
For entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The soccer championship may help people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only &quot;black&quot; on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation at RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as, for example, a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain, said in a recent interview with LN.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns burns
The fire has caught in the morning a transformer of the company Čeps in a switch box near the village Výškov in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for the Ústí region firefighters, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously the firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, however later they changed their mind and the fire is being extinguished with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company&#39;s spokeswoman, the breakdown does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is out.
According to Mandátová it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of the activity of Čeps nothing similar happened, breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the ČEZ society spokeswoman for the Northern Czech Republic, the electricity supplies were not cut off, and the fire in the electrical substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
As Čeps působí in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distributive system, of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical conduction.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, in addition to maintaining the 4339-kilometer-long electrical conduction.
Jančura will file a libel complaint against three hetmáns of ČSSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura today will file a slander complaint against three social democratic hetmans.
They are Michal Hašek from the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubický kraj and the hetman from Olomoucký kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions however ended up signing long-term contracts with České dráhy.
All the three hetmans are attacking us and they speak of the fact that we are &quot;taking the raisins of the cake&quot;, however we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices for České dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the Student Agency society, he told Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned at the same time having the tests from all the regions. According to him they have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr. Jančura&#39;s media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to other hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, that also on this occasion it will be clearly demonstrated, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn the regions of these measures.
He told Radiožurnál that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura started the campaign after the regions agreed with České dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion crowns they did not call for a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are in disagreement with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a deputy from ČSSD, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don&#39;t quit, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a Member of the ČSSD, I know who he is, I will not say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As the first vaccination it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions already appear that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are complete.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
The experts also already have it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations for children born in August
As of January, children born since August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is not having received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily allowed their children to be vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents however paid for a dose 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually on vaccines.
However, they will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far the state has spent approximately 500,000 annually on vaccinating children.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of pneumococcal infections in our country every year, according to research in hospitals, 28 children no older than 10 years of age die.
In addition to the Czech Republic, pneumococcal vaccine coverage in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, opinions appear at the same time that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January it must be covered by insurance companies and voluntary.
Compulsory vaccination would be better, said Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association, for example.
Your association has been propagating pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It is not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this time we are not thinking about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccine has its downsides, doctors say
The president of the pediatric society Odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children would receive the vaccine, one can reason about reducing the number of doses. &quot;In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started the vaccination as voluntary,&quot; says Cabrnochová.
Experts hope that as of next year more than 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococci.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children it is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save on treatment later, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However pediatricians are concerned about purchasing vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some deputies, however, were afraid that the insurance companies could &quot;take the money out of health insurance.&quot;
Doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait, until they are paid for by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest 40 thousand a month in vaccines, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved &quot;in a museum robbery&quot;
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been charged with trying to steal paintings valued at $ 20 million (£ 12 million) from his father&#39;s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while loading 90 frames into his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used a bulldozer to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
81-year-old Frazetta Sr. is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
The AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta Jr., 52, told police that his father had ordered him &quot;to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse.&quot;
The agency said Frazetta Sr. denied granting such permission.
Labor party defends budget tax increases
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling &quot;squandered&quot; an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Finance Minister was also harshly criticized for hurting low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% rise in Social Security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements as of 2011.
Anger over Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being hit with a recession generated by others, and warned of future &quot;trouble.&quot;
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by around three billion pounds per year, has angered the business community, which claims that this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £ 20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
Economy will contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers&#39; bonds
The 1 point increase in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax breaks for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, a person earning £ 30,000 will lose £ 90 a year and a person earning £ 40,000 will lose £ 190, while a person earning £ 10,000 a year will earn £ 110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved &quot;tough decisions,&quot; but insisted that 60% of the supplemental tax burden would fall on the top 5% of salaries.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending cuts were a &quot;grain of sand in the desert&quot; compared to what was needed.
&quot;These are big numbers. It will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential over the next four years,&quot; he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labor Party&#39;s forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence how much to borrow and how quickly the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister was forced to change. the first figures.
In his statement, he claimed that the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while borrowing would be £ 3bn higher than previously. estimated.
&quot;Missed opportunity&quot;
The Conservatives, who will launch a new ad campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labor party&#39;s &quot;debt crisis&quot;, said the projection for borrowing £ 789 billion over the next six years was unsustainable.
The ministers had failed to come up with a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, &quot;cynically&quot; dodging the tough options until after elections due to be held in June 2010.
&quot;They have not included anything significant about what they will do,&quot; said Finance Ministry shadow Minister Philip Hammond. &quot;They had the opportunity to do it and they have wasted it.&quot;
&quot;All major announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins&quot;
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labor Party insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the conservative proposals, which would seek greater deficit reduction in the shorter term.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year&#39;s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like &quot;sand castles.&quot;
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcements, such as the rising inflation of some disability benefits in April mentioned above, would leave the Chancellor of the Exchequer open to accusations of maneuvering. electoral, since the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labor Party insists that it is being provided to the people most in need and will review the situation in September 2010.
&quot;Fake budget&quot;
Although ministers did not release post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment in public spending would only make itself felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the finance minister&#39;s figures implied substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
&quot;This is really postponing the pain for later,&quot; said its director, Robert Chote.
&quot;All the big announcements will come after the election, whoever wins,&quot; added Roger Bootle, financial consultant to Deloitte accountants.
&quot;This has been the false pre-budget report. The markets realize this.&quot;
The FBI inquires about the &quot;arrests of Americans in Pakistan&quot;
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The Pakistani US embassy told the BBC that the men were detained in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the US state of Virginia last month.
The US Department of Foreign Affairs said it was also seeking information on the men.
Three of them are reported to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
&quot;If they are American citizens, of course we are going to be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are being held,&quot; said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
&quot;We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing,&quot; the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house that belongs to one of their uncle.
He said the house was already in the crosshairs of local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported; But he said the US had to &quot;work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.&quot;
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian &quot;abuses&quot;
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been just as deficient, according to a report by the campaign group Amnesty International.
The report details &quot;patterns of abuse&quot; of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
A man named in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said they threatened to rape him.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said that such criticism has a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and the dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance towards criticism, according to our correspondent.
&quot;False confession&quot;
Amnesty International cited the account of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer science student, who claimed that he was accused of &quot;working with Facebook networks&quot; and protesting the election result.
&quot;They often hit me in the face&quot; in his words.
&quot;They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head ... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me.&quot;
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and they released him and left him on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said that some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the post-election unrest and the government&#39;s response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were unclear and the parliamentary committee&#39;s findings had not been made public. .
The group said that at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
Over 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite scary.
There is a beautiful view of the twinkling city lights below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent, &quot;he added.
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the event on Thursday afternoon, the snow will melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Secular State.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for the construction of minarets to be banned and there is widespread alert about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies on the continent.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author&#39;s latest work &quot;Why the French Don&#39;t Like Headcarves&quot; (2006), an elegant and thoroughly argued study of a a problem that divided and preoccupied the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen&#39;s latest book takes a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, you want to know not only what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France with what Mr. Bowen calls &quot;Islamic spaces.&quot;
He is a good listener who plays discussions between teachers and students on the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about gay evolution and rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of everyday life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar and scholar.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They fail to spread this argument fully.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with their Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires tradeoffs.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so fiercely defend secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives &quot;an adjustment of values&quot;.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say &quot;Yes, but not yet.&quot;
The most bleak panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, transportation, and fishing interests have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers, and now authors, as a consequence.
In &quot;On Thin Ice&quot; Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave proof of courage by confronting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a courageous 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The cubs, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century featured 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth the area of a wild adult&#39;s range. The weather is rarely suitable: A Singapore-resident polar bear was turned green by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on accounts from other writers and historians, often returning to the threat hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the US and Russia, the slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Eskimo Indians on snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last the longest.
In his new book, &quot;After the Ice,&quot; Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a chilling and clear account of Arctic science and an eerie look at how the future can be transformed. from that place.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the rate of change.
It is not for lack of determination.
Fridtjof Nansen&#39;s pioneering travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave hints for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then cold war submarines mapped the shifting strands of ice that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but hardy individuals camped out in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, made up of streams of saline water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice retreats, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... this could be us
Marines among 6,000 who lay wreaths at Arlington graves
Pfc. De&#39;Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, NC, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, where we&#39;re being shipped from, this could be us, Robinson said of the downed soldiers.
If it&#39;s us, I&#39;d want someone to do the same for me, so I&#39;m just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who came together Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
In what is now an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey each year, stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has spread the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on graves in Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the memorial site for the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $ 150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late career military man.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It is like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don&#39;t get as many visitors as new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was joyous as the children played and the couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular wreath was deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations (Association for the Soldier) donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the freezing air.
Some read aloud names carved into the stones, while others leaned over to see small black and white plaques set within the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes in front of their son&#39;s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine gunner Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who was killed in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
&quot;Long after my death I want someone to remember him.&quot;
Cuban officers arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has detained a US government contractor who distributed cell phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company works on projects for clients such as the United States Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the US Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed &quot;dangerous.&quot;
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writing, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledgling blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a US contractor is likely to provoke tensions between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a &quot;slow-paced&quot; approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to report the arrest Friday night.
The new US policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Cell phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $ 15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobiles only this year; they are mostly used for text messages, since a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer with the US Interests Section in Havana, said that most of the handful of US citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said it could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as giving away free mobile phones, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch organization, which recently published a harsh report on freedoms in Cuba. Cuba, called &quot;New Castro, same Cuba&quot;, a reference to the appointment of Raúl Castro as the country&#39;s leader, to replace his sickly older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, tried and jailed within a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday Pakistani authorities neutralized the suspected mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who scour the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving of terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan&#39;s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were unfazed and were even trying to get proper approval to enter al Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who is trusted.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, US intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people into al Qaeda.
The organization&#39;s recruiters act as guards, keeping out those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda looks closely at aspiring American recruits.
But they are enormously attractive to the organization, because of their potential to access American targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit, because US intelligence agencies have become adept at their methods. recruiting.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? Kohlmann stated.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate &quot;action&quot;
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here demanding that negotiators working at the city&#39;s Bella Center Convention Center take bolder action for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists planted small explosives near a group of government buildings in the center of the city.
On a day in which little happened in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city holding placards in English that read &quot;There is no planet B&quot; and one in Spanish that declared, &quot;Earth says &quot;stop&quot;.
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, her mother&#39;s native country, made me aware of the heartbreaking issues the country must grapple with due to the impacts of the climate changes that are already happening. &quot;
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to world leaders, to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists in sports masks and black outfits planted several explosives near Copenhagen&#39;s main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as flares, but were followed by &quot;a couple of big explosions.&quot;
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China&#39;s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the rally was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, &quot;I really wasn&#39;t aware of the situation.&quot;
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, &quot;Since the meeting place is big, I can&#39;t hear what&#39;s going on outside.&quot;
He pointed out that it was up to each one&#39;s perspective to define whether the march was being detrimental or beneficial.
He said that this shows the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, &quot;it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test data reveals persistent racial differences
Last week&#39;s federal report card on math achievement was very good news for the Capital District public schools.
Although the District is still far from the best performing systems in the country, the report card showed fourth and eighth graders striding at a faster pace over the past two years, relative to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago. and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent achievement gap between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
Average scores for white DC fourth graders over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased just three points, from 209 to 212.
Actually the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
Eighth-grade African-Americans&#39; progress remained essentially flat, dropping a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a span of six years, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between black and white fourth graders in 2003, when the District&#39;s first ENPE was released, was 60 points on the scale (262-202).
Although the scores achieved by the children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has only narrowed to 58.
Some education attorneys in the District expressed concern last week that the advancements celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the whole by serving those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and contentious, said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for educational equity in the District. .
I&#39;m not jumping for joy by a difference of two or three points, said DC Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a long-time critic of Rhee&#39;s management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city&#39;s high schools are in desperate need of attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what is worrying is that we are not putting in the time or energy necessary for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of elementary and middle school, who did not master the basics of early reading in their early years. school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Math, a kindergarten through sixth grade math curriculum that emphasizes games and real-life experiences, was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, credited with some progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for underperforming schools, which will be necessary to decrease the gap.
There&#39;s something of a rocky dilemma here for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to direct your resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of DC.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to hold on to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access an excellent public education.
Janey, now the superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in closing the achievement gap is lengthening the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools.
You have to reach almost 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers&#39; union last year in a 185-day year, which she considers as an &quot;indicator&quot; to seek a greater increase. in the next agreement.
Make higher education a part of more futures
The tour bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a loud wheeze.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, descended and blinked for a moment at the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela&#39;s parents had just graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $ 38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than it was of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! This is where I&#39;ll be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Gee, really? She said thoughtfully, when the guide spoke of the school&#39;s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the children had visited in their three-day trip, and they had already fully absorbed its deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States to Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in their teens, there are also hundreds of thousands who are accessing the college education they need to enter the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these &quot;second-generation&quot; Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexican and Central American, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, say the researchers, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the nation&#39;s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest achievers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to be successful.
Many also have parents who set lofty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play a unique role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents don&#39;t have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time is not going to fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis. , who has tested Latino students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten through high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela&#39;s college tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $ 300 million per year to local school systems to run college preparatory programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue through high school.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the US Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a leading role in restoring Iraq&#39;s oil industry, maimed by decades of war and sanctions.
US companies walked away having bid on only two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two US companies reached deals for fields auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the US oil giants at the opening of Iraq&#39;s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asians and Europeans are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the US military withdraws, likely prevented US oil companies from taking more aggressive risks in Iraq, which has the world&#39;s third-largest oil reserves. analysts said.
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only US companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major US firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have forged ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation bid on more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two major fields.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will keep up with its competitors and fulfill its commitments towards Iraq.
The companies shortlisted to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the subsidy per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels at each field.
Al Qaeda&#39;s top planner has apparently been assassinated in Pakistan
An alleged US missile attack on Pakistan&#39;s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, US counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles struck his car near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to US sources and Pakistani officials. region of.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified plane, the type operated by the CIA within Pakistan&#39;s illegal tribal area.
They were driving a white car, heading for the Afghan border, when the car was hit, an official from Pakistan&#39;s civilian intelligence agency said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the &quot;totally mangled bodies.&quot;
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two US counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al Qaeda military planner, who led the terror group&#39;s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He engaged in conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke anonymously, citing the sensitive nature of US airstrikes inside Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this likely included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had strategic guidance from al Qaeda&#39;s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second US official said Somali had risen rapidly through the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a household name to some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official asserted.
If confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader to be assassinated since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led drone strikes has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a tally by The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-governmental organization. profit.
The decline is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site claimed.
The top UN envoy in Kabul about to resign
The top United Nations envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would resign from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that was hurt by widespread corruption allegations in Afghanistan&#39;s UN-backed presidential election.
Eide&#39;s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the US timetable for military withdrawal starting in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the readiness of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also lobbied the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants to assist in Afghanistan&#39;s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civil sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so that he would have time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that they better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian national who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide&#39;s position in Afghanistan was put to the test before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country&#39;s presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said the allegations by Galbraith, who was fired, &quot;surely hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism regarding international interference&quot; in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed for UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, who are lending themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase his confidence that his money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on her powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN recruitment regulations undermine her ability to recruit talent.
So much so that the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose &quot;significant additional sanctions&quot; against Iran for its failure to enter into talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of about 300 US troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier&#39;s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran&#39;s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the broader Iranian population.
He argued that &quot;a package of incentives and disincentives&quot; would be necessary &quot;to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons&quot;, because &quot;their people will suffer greatly&quot; from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face &quot;credible&quot; consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the directions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, it indicated that it would re-negotiate on restricting its nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial part of its enriched uranium reserve in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has lobbied for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have backed away from the tentative deals, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, I think that Iran&#39;s tightening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has brought the international community together, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been on terms. significant additional sanctions against Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before considering other options, including pursuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called &quot;devastating sanctions.&quot;
In a statement made in New York, Iran&#39;s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called on Thursday &quot;baseless and baseless allegations&quot; by some members of the Security Council about Iran&#39;s nuclear activities, saying that is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, &quot;in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution.&quot;
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq&#39;s Arab majority, particularly over borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to lessen the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in US projects, to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to ease Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. US officials quoted Gates&#39;s words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: &quot;We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them. &quot;
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them on the fact that &quot;Mother Earth is too tired to support more children&quot; and &quot;one more baby means one more grave.&quot;
They learned their lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city&#39;s low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their The reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy just for one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously chubby children, spoiled only children, affectionately dubbed &quot;little emperors,&quot; a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The median birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared with six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
Demographics of the UN, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent .
The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai&#39;s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies to &quot;help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate a future labor shortage.&quot;
Shanghai is about to be &quot;as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,&quot; he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted into the country&#39;s constitution in 1978, China&#39;s one-child policy is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced by the Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual pay in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoiding critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
Additionally, many couples have performed abortions based on the sex of the fetus, leading to an unnaturally high male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife are only children, and in 2007 they toned down many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Peking University Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, the posters ordering families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slip brochures under the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in applications from couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
Huinan municipality, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still only projected to reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Caolu Township Family Planning Committee in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don&#39;t want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally able to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient life and health insurance provided by the government.
Without a social safety net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view the one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple&#39;s first child.
Yes, they are robbing us of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It is the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she was an only child: &quot;We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really don&#39;t want to take care of others. &quot;
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more forcefully.
For middle-class dual-career parents who lower the birth rate, he said, it&#39;s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People in their 20s and 30s grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of China&#39;s experiment with capitalism and they don&#39;t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of parenting time, he argued.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are issues of space, &quot;they have to remodel their apartment&quot;, and the strategic one &quot;has to have a curriculum prepared for the best nurseries when the child is 9 months old.&quot;
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don&#39;t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by defiant stances and mutual recriminations, garnered renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that envisions ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that bear most of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and outlined the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc UN working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to poor ones to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit to the global rise in temperature that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives the process a lot of flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what top UN climate official Yvo de Boer described as &quot;the big picture.&quot;
It shows the profiles for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25-45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 percent.
Together, the countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, promising to provide $ 3.6 billion annually for the next three years, to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Still, the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated conversations last week was featured on Friday.
US special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the world. developed.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that America&#39;s top climate negotiator lacked &quot;common sense,&quot; or was &quot;highly irresponsible&quot; for saying earlier in the week that the The United States would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world&#39;s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is as much to save individual economies as it is to save the planet, with China and the United States grappling over their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing over who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain large emitters. responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional adviser on climate change for Mexico and Central America, for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, even though most major players say the talks will at best produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drew up a preliminary 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push from small island nations has &quot;put political pressure on the entire political process,&quot; in part because they are now unified and demand action from the emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the one-off issues before the heads of government can close a deal.
High-level officials, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice Minister, got off the planes and ran into the corridors of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, in order to narrow down the claims that they will be refereed during the next week.
The utter disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, activists who play the guitar put on nightly shows mocking the countries they claim are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed hand-in-hand in instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all the key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain&#39;s first 225km / h train redefines that Monday sentiment
At 5.13am on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure marking a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country&#39;s first intercity high-speed train will hit 225km / h when it storms from Ashford, Kent, to London&#39;s St Panrcas station, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will later be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first intercity Javelin service out of London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected outlying areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and switching from planes and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions as well as ease congestion on highways.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this view.
But the tens of billions of pounds it takes to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, may still hold back Britain&#39;s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times learned.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next planned stage for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five meter radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a 25-meter radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to establish three options for a broader high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will reply in the spring.
The favored option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would split into or near Birmingham, with one branch running west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another north-east to Sheffield, Leeds, and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
&quot;It looks like this will be the most beneficial option,&quot; said a member of the railroad.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km / h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support 400-meter-long trains, capable of transporting 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of handling 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital&#39;s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston stations offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
Trains would initially be forced to leave express lines on existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point necessary to ensure a shift from planes to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for a £ 75,000 orange grove from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built in his constituency home.
The party&#39;s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living &quot;on rations&quot;, increased his mortgage by £ 75,000 to build an oak-framed extension on his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the supplemental interest, totaling hundreds of pounds a month.
House of Commons officials approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members&#39; spending. Last night Mr. Duncan said the requests &quot;could not be clearer or simpler.&quot;
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a town in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have sold for almost a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described on the plans as an &quot;orange grove.&quot;
Neighbors described it as &quot;a greenhouse for entertainment.&quot;
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase, during a recent House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges investigation into his past mortgage settlements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a £ 271,406 mortgage on his London property to the house in his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became MP.
Documents released this week show Mr Duncan was applying for approximately £ 1,400 a month in mortgage interest, as of March of last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £ 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan&#39;s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase was to finance the £ 75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the rate at which it is now.
The most recent document issued by the authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr Duncan was still requesting £ 1,250 per month in the month of May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as Speaker of the House opposition in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that MPs had to survive &quot;on rations&quot; after the spending scandal.
&quot;Basically this is being nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like shit.&quot;
He stated: “I spend my money on my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could request a lot more, but I don&#39;t. &quot;
The MP, a millionaire by his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the wage office that this “could be considered excessive&quot;.
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the pound sterling symbol in Mr Duncan&#39;s lawn in protest, after it was revealed that he applied for £ 4,000 over three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said: &quot;It was for major improvements, approved both by the wage office and later by Legg.&quot;
He added: “It&#39;s not about circumventing and committing crimes or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within limits, as per the rules, authorized and all.
It couldn&#39;t be in any way clearer or simpler. &quot;
Come, those of you who have faith, to see the Brighton Beach Palapa Advent Calendar
Brighton&#39;s palapas have found new impetus for the winter months on an interactive Advent calendar.
Additionally, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each day in December, using Christmas carols as their theme.
The event kicked off on December 1, with guests viewing the last palapa from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM daily, with filled cupcakes and punch served free.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV Marketing Assistant, is an unpaid clergyman from the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He stated: &quot;We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.&quot;
&quot;Why do we as a Church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the Church should come to the people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the Palapa Advent calendar started as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality. &quot;
Mass mobilization for climate in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday demanding an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police detained several hundred people.
About thirty thousand people, according to the police; Hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the frozen Danish capital demanding an agreement that the United Nations Conference on climate change must reach no later than Friday. This would enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for the climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the &quot;political price&quot; of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, smashed shop windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, these are especially members of the &quot;Black Blocks&quot;, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in last april.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were detained &quot;without distinction&quot;, underlining that a hundred of them &quot;were immobilized in the street on Saturday night in handcuffs. and sitting despite the intense cold. &quot;
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and headed towards the Bella Center, the venue for the negotiations.
The protesters stopped approximately 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to host the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by coach and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them wearing light blue raincoats, responded by forming a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form &quot;blue tides&quot; for &quot;justice and for the climate&quot;.
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on saying: there is time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that run dry, waterways that you can walk through like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement reached out to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, an anti-globalization figure, explained that he came to Copenhagen to &quot;unite climate justice and social justice&quot;: &quot;today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world.&quot;
The Asia Pacific region, which includes many islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red clothes and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, there were gatherings of hundreds of protesters demanding to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network &quot;350&quot; gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Abkhaz separatist elected president, although Georgia denounces &quot;fraud&quot;
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow for more than a year, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces &quot;fraud&quot;.
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to those responsible for the Abkhaz Election Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before closing.
The first provisional results would be announced Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergueï Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the vote count.
These elections are a sham.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheïl Saakachvili &quot;regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under full Russian occupation,&quot; declared his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who made their way to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a pretty white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this sumptuously landscaped region on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch next to the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different parts of this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to monitor the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and most particularly, the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexeï Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes control of the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, maintains that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where the police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
About thirty thousand people, according to the police; Hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013 .
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped approximately 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was erected to host the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candlelight vigil.
Moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke shop windows with bricks and hammers, reported an AFP journalist.
Riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, knocking several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the &quot;Black Blocks&quot;, ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was hit in the jaw by a cobblestone, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, according to police.
We do not take our eyes off the extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as police helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by coach and train from the big cities of Germany, from London, from Amsterdam, even from Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them wearing light blue raincoats, responded by forming a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form &quot;blue tides&quot; for &quot;justice and for the climate&quot;.
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

The Oxfam organization together with the former UN Commissioner for Refugees, Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including the Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which includes many islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated dressed in red and wearing scarves with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of hundreds of protesters were formed demanding action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network &quot;350&quot; gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, declared in an interview that will be broadcast in the Sunday News (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be &quot;strengthened&quot; by the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated of compulsory education in the second year of scientific baccalaureate.
From now on, all first year high school students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, &quot;hypocrisy is enough&quot; because, according to him, &quot;branch C is no longer a scientific branch&quot;, but &quot;in general, it brings together the best students.&quot;
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be sub-branches of C, he goes on to underline even: &quot;I did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged at having eliminated history and geography in the second year of high school in technology schools.&quot;
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L&#39;Humanité revealed that approximately seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government project to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in the second year of high school C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some representatives Right-wing elected officials also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that &quot;there is no talk&quot; of eliminating philosophy from the C second high school program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will take an admission test that will target their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also do internships in real conditions during the M2 year, after which they will spend a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he is going to propose &quot;the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education.&quot;
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map &quot;before 2012&quot;.
At the Escuela Normal Superior, the experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge accepted on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Evolution of Climate (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize winner, opened the &quot;Ernest&quot; conference round, a day made up of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day named after the students named the fish in the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
On global warming, &quot;we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes,&quot; Jean Jouzel, who presented without notes, but with the help of graphics, told AFP in front of about fifty people.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public understands that &quot;the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record.&quot;
Videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school&#39;s website beginning December 15th.
The next &quot;Ernest&quot; session is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly rate.
Late payments: disgust among prison guards, action planned
The prison guards unions called on Friday for a &quot;general mobilization&quot; to demand payment of bonuses and overtime before the end of the year holidays, which was postponed until due to budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers Force (2nd guards union) asked off-duty personnel to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and &quot;block them&quot; to denounce the theft of their assets.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) summons them to &quot;meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization&quot;, as it labels as &quot;shameful and unacceptable&quot; the failure to pay in December of the &quot;overtime, bonuses nights, Sundays and holidays &quot;worked in October.
And the first guards union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap / Unsa), &quot;calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury.&quot;
The Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime hours increased a lot in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
Late in the day, the Chancellery reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards&#39; unions guaranteeing them that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by the staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures designed to ensure that this situation generated by a poor evaluation of the number of overtime hours does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be low, except for management personnel who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and objectives, and who &quot;always blame the budgetary demands,&quot; deplored Ufap / Unsa.
It is a real scandal, said the interregional union FO of Marseille indignantly, announcing its decision to boycott &quot;all meetings and convocation&quot; until further notice.
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At the moment in which the tasks and missions increase without taking more troops, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salary of the staff, estimates the CGT prison of Bordeaux.
According to the unions, this is not the case in all regions, as some are luckier than others.
But in any case, the result is not what was expected, said the general secretary of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama Says He Gives &quot;Better Gifts&quot; Than He Receives
US President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Christmas as a family at the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter, Oprah Winfrey, that he came to a simple conclusion about gifts: &quot;I make better gifts than I receive. &quot;.
During a special interview that the ABC network will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end of the year parties at their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be in the game.
Santa Claus loves Bo too, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will &quot;of course&quot; receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband&#39;s statements about the quality of the gifts he receives: &quot;No way, last year I gave you nice gifts,&quot; she said, provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before replying humorously by pointing to the First Lady&#39;s pearl necklace: &quot;Who gave you that?&quot;
During the hour-long interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous entertainer who devotedly supported Barack Obama&#39;s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bicycle, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, said the President.
Only many years later, I found out that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I lined up all the furniture against the wall, instead of arranging it around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he is in an induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles due to important &quot;injuries&quot; derived from an operation in France, but the situation is &quot;under control&quot; according to his relatives, while RTL affirms that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications .
The 66-year-old rocker was operated on again Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors verified &quot;injuries derived from the operation&quot; of a herniated disc carried out in Paris on November 26, his press service said. in that same city, indicating that said injuries &quot;needed a repair operation.&quot;
However, the singer&#39;s press service tried to convey reassurance stating that the situation was &quot;under control&quot;, and reported that a new medical report would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer&#39;s last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid &quot;pain and complications.&quot;
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about their condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that &quot;according to some sources&quot; no cannula was inserted after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had undergone surgery at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in the artistic world.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information broadcast by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection resulting from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through &quot;a bad time&quot;, but assured that he did not make &quot;any problems&quot; because the rocker is &quot;a fighter.&quot;
He called me just before going to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was silly to fly 12 hours after such an operation, it is not possible, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician&#39;s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, tried to reassure him by stating that Johnny Hallyday &quot;reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics&quot; and that the infection was &quot;controlled.&quot;
Camus said he had spoken with Laeticia, the musician&#39;s wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer&#39;s health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on for &quot;colon cancer&quot; after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long &quot;Tour 66&quot;, presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been talked about exaggeratedly. Fans and journalists noted the musician&#39;s difficulties to move on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009 / short pool: Bousquet&#39;s first title in his favorite distance
The French Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist in the 2009 World Cups in the long pool, won an international title on Thursday in a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in the short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were allowed for the last time, only three world records were broken when in reality many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relay 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A shame for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in the 50m freestyle, a mark he owns in the long pool (20.94).
In one of the two leading distances in swimming, in the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with 20&#39;&#39;53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet got ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits, which will be banned from January 1.
These swimsuits, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same event.
This time the use of the swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower his mark in the 400 m freestyle (3: 32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time of his career (3: 34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82).
I did not give myself thoroughly in this race.
I knew that this time I was not going to be able to break a world record, but I managed to defend my title and I fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: A sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for $ 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold for $ 1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, the Sotheby&#39;s art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the third century after Christ, and its price had been estimated between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble &quot;depicting four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is a rare piece, as there are only four or five in the world,&quot; Vice President Florent Heintz told AFP on Tuesday auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby&#39;s.
It was sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the highest bid by buyers, without a doubt, a Sotheby&#39;s spokesman, Dan Abernethy, told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, later it appeared successively in the house of the French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For some fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an &quot;Emile Zola succession&quot; opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; and the fresco of the &quot;Rougon- Macquart &quot;.
Honduras aborted Zelaya&#39;s departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not in place to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe conduct by the coup government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, declared the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya back to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
In order to grant him a safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to &quot;resign&quot; and request political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to arrive in Mexico as a guest head of state.
The coup government &quot;suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my position (...), they wanted me to present my resignation,&quot; Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that He has been in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, playing a few chords.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Minister of the Interior of the coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not request asylum from any country, replied Manuel Zelaya in an interview on the Telesur network, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya&#39;s departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Celso Amorim, criticized the position of the coup government.
That reflects the marginal character of this government compared to international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day on which he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he unexpectedly returned on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the courts for the crime of &quot;high treason,&quot; according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial vote, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya&#39;s return to power until his term expired on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed higher this Thursday, the figures for the US trade balance are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points, reaching 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, with a technological component, 7.13 points, reaching 2,190.06 points.
The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 expanded index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We get good news from different sectors of the economy, said FTN Financial&#39;s Lindsey Piegza.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrating &quot;on the glass half full.&quot;
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures for the US trade balance, &quot;which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.&quot;
The United States trade deficit fell 7.6% in October compared to September, to $ 32.9 billion.
On the contrary, analysts expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly goods exports, which reflect the growth of the major economies that trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research company Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the median number of new job applicants &quot;was the lowest in a year,&quot; said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond at 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of power boo the &quot;Ladies in White&quot;
This Thursday hundreds of supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty &quot;Ladies in White&quot;, wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked in the street by supporters of the government of Raúl Castro as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of these detainees, said an AFP journalist.
The Yankees die! &quot;Mercenaries!&quot;, &quot;The street belongs to the revolutionaries!&quot;, &quot;Long live Fidel and Raúl!&quot; The militants of power chanted the dissidents with their fists raised.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who came to &quot;protect&quot; them.
The day before, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the &quot;Ladies in White&quot; in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were detained by plainclothes police officers, reported an AFP journalist.
The officers forcibly loaded the vehicles into the dissidents who were booed by government supporters, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The &quot;Ladies in White&quot;, awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to &quot;request the release of all political prisoners&quot;, some 200 according to the dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents jailed in March 2003, of which 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities brand the opponents as &quot;mercenaries&quot; or as &quot;agents&quot; in the pay of their avowed enemy, the United States.
A very rare occurrence in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday&#39;s demonstration by government militants against the &quot;counterrevolutionaries.&quot;
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An insane man kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the city center of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts de Seine) on Thursday at the peak of the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker struck an old man with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources reported and witnesses.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in hospital, according to an official from the Alliance police union.
Later in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, in his thirties, stepped in and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the old man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman fainted and was admitted &quot;in a state of shock,&quot; a police source reported.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped along Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
Apparently randomly, he would have injured two more pedestrians: a thirty-year-old man, and a forty-year-old man seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he carried across his back, explained an official of the Alliance union in the Hautes-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé, at the scene.
Several passersby, including young people, tried to control the alienated person, according to the testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn&#39;t make it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a bartender at a nearby bar.
A crowd jumped on him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at number 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to arrest the armed man and were punched, according to police testimonies.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Some people came to tell me that there was an injured man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. By putting him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, approximately 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers detained the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor&#39;s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Altos del Sena Judicial Police Departmental Service (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he has not said a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of admitting him to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to subdue him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was &quot;in a state of overexcitement&quot; like &quot;every deranged person of this type whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action.&quot;
USA: Polanski&#39;s lawyer asks again for the case to be dismissed
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski demanded again this Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, be dismissed for a case of sexual abuse happened more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney for the director of &quot;El Pianista&quot;, denounced before three judges of the Chamber of Appeals of the Second District of California serious errors of procedure at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that the charges be dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, &quot;was chilling.&quot;
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has since died) had spoken with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before sentencing, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary &quot;Roman Polanski: wanted and desired&quot;, from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September &quot;to have lied&quot; to the author of the documentary.
Hummel demanded the holding of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in the event that the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument presented in the first instance, that is, that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously evaluated as long as Roman Polanski did not appear in court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was handed down for &quot;illegal sex&quot; with a girl under the age of 13.
Since then, he has never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski &quot;has to be here to appear at the hearing.&quot;
With this case, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing? Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker &quot;asks the court for a favor, although he despises its authority.&quot;
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their sentence, also stressed &quot;that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee.&quot;
Hummel was not the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer&#39;s lawyer, the victim, also called, once again, to close the case.
He maintains that his client can no longer bear to be harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: &quot;No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough. &quot;
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, pending possible extradition.
Wall Street loses its way and slows down due to the rise in the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed this Friday aimlessly, in a market that is debated between better indicators than those expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0, 03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, of a technological component, lost 0.55 points to settle at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 expanded index advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
The market is honestly very quiet, noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain that way until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which &quot;helped improve market sentiment regarding the strength of the economic recovery,&quot; summarized analysts at Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and higher than expected.
In addition, US consumer confidence rebounded visibly in December, from 73.4 to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were held back by a new advance of the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which &quot;takes down sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation&quot;, explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of the Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring in South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title are in the final stretch to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the outskirts of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Athlete or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw many things and lived countless experiences! Said Miss Sierra Leone in amazement.
This event, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5:00 p.m. (3:00 p.m. GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and by the possibility of rediscovering &quot;African landscapes that take her breath away.&quot;
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, the Miss World candidates focus on the pageant.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned into Bollywood stars.
Every woman&#39;s dream is to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it&#39;s not just about looks.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, with a swimsuit.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee chair Steve Douglas will host the event.
South Africa proved capable of welcoming the world with warmth and pride that are hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, the candidates went on safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional event, they met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Uncommon for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the Soccer World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I would meet.
He will probably come back for the 2010 World Cup, enthuses Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday &quot;is very positive&quot;, according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday &quot;is very positive,&quot; said his son David on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his father who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane that was bringing him from Paris shortly after 1pm local time (9pm GMT).
The singer&#39;s son, distended, assured that he would be transferred &quot;as soon as possible&quot; to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection derived from the herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician has been &quot;in an induced coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to avoid suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment,&quot; the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday due to an infection, the consequence of a herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went on Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade attends, to witness a school event, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic in Parc Monceau, in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus maintained that Johnny Hallyday had &quot;traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.&quot;
I spoke directly with the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, since I had been operated twice for herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before on the RTL station, he indicated that apparently the singer had &quot;gone without a cannula, with nothing&quot;, after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, he also intervened on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a bruise formed as a result of a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by the courts on several occasions for malpractice, as well as tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being &quot;an unscrupulous man&quot; regularly &quot;sued&quot; before the Order&#39;s Council, and he is &quot;far from recommended.&quot;
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his attorney, David Koubbi.
He stated that the intervention &quot;was carried out without any inconvenience&quot; and that the results of the postoperative studies were &quot;normal&quot;.
The operation &quot;could not cause bleeding and therefore did not need drainage,&quot; he added.
In any case, the singer&#39;s tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a hiatus.
Without a doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned seems very risky to me, Camus declared.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union para la Democracia Française), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted this Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch a takeover bid (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the Acronym of the former Giscardista party, prompting him to withdraw it from all support, under penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, since he considers that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after having extended his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Defense Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of his management, he received the help of deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF trademark, as he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou&#39;s friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy, urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the funds to them. trademark property rights, under penalty of legal action.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from MoDem , as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is correct to continue using the name of the movement, the + Nouveau center +, and the slogan + l&#39;UDF d&#39;aujourd&#39;hui + in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter argue.
As you already know, they do not have any right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that demands that the NC withdraw &quot;immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from all media, as well as from (its) Internet site.&quot;
It also asks Hervé de Charette &quot;to transfer the ownership of (the) trademark to the legitimate right holders&quot;.
Failure to do so will appeal to justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF &quot;has been a true political movement since 1978&quot; and recall that Morin and his friends &quot;chose&quot; to leave in 2007 &quot;to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP&quot; .
Therefore, the New Center does not have, according to them, any right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending &quot;the material and moral interests&quot; of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d&#39;Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, &quot;when he registered the trademark,&quot; he was no longer &quot;a member of the UDF for three years&quot;, but of the UMP.
Take advantage of scandalous and fraudulent the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on your own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before making fun of the NC&#39;s strategy: &quot;We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worth making your own name than trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name from which you don&#39;t have the right &quot;.
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
This Friday the Court of Nanterre decided to put the artist François-Marie Banier on trial to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of the octogenarian&#39;s state of weakness to plunder her of a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of entertainment stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euros of fine .
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter vie for the reins of the L&#39;Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L&#39;Oréal always refused to submit to such examinations, even more in the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor&#39;s Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must deliver a report before March 10, 2010 in which they must state whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness and during what periods.
I think he will accept.
I am going to speak to her, declared Mrs. Bettencourt&#39;s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, leaving the hearing.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court&#39;s decision.
It is excellent news (…) The expert opinion will show that he (Banier) manipulated this elderly woman, whom we must protect, he said.
Two years ago, Liliane Bettencourt&#39;s only daughter began criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of having taken advantage of his mother&#39;s weakness over the years to obtain one billion euros in donations, through checks, contracts life insurance or artwork.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the merits of the action filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the allegations of the lawyers resulted, on some occasions, a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt&#39;s lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said that she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers&#39; husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: &quot;I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since their wedding, I have never been able to speak to Françoise again. &quot;
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor&#39;s Office considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to grant her request to open a procedure of legal guardianship for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt &quot;has full capacity to appear in court, is not under guardianship and does not have a guardian.
No other person will be able to appear in his place &quot;, affirmed the representative of the Public Ministry, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule after the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial Revolution or End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain ...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to certain &quot;values&quot; from above, as before, it was a matter of imposing products designed by factory technicians on consumers.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to strategies to conquer markets ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to customer preference factors is repeat regularly.
An employee demobilization can end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&amp;D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) &quot;requires that all parties involved (...) have a proactive behavior and a forward-looking vision&quot;; it requires a commitment from employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we call for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the company&#39;s concerns as well as the client.
Internal opinion polls are relatively useful
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, faced with a new situation, and after many turns, all companies end up doing essentially ... what they always did! B989
-Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great engineering schools, they interpret psychology mechanistically.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the ancient behaviorist theory that the American &quot;neurosciences&quot; recently reactivated, and widely disseminated behind their backs by the Institutes of Studies and the media.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the &quot;commands&quot; (sic) of executive commitment, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management stance, unadapted to today&#39;s world .
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies, supposes adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating in all reasoning or business management practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects come true.
Today, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
The studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilization factors, company managers can monitor, anticipate and anticipate their &quot;social performance&quot; and relocate human resources management &quot;in place.&quot;
In this way, they create a favorable terrain for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for the &quot;just war&quot; Obama receives praise from the right
This Friday, the American right wing, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of a &quot;just war&quot; against the enemies of the United States, hailed Obama&#39;s speech on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited Obama&#39;s award ceremony on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 elections.
I loved what she said, Ms. Palin, a leading figure on the Republican Party&#39;s right wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war &quot;sometimes necessary&quot; in her recently published memoir.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
Terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself this Thursday in Oslo to justifying the use of force, a way of explaining his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days before.
Another Obama adversary, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done &quot;a very good job&quot; in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former speaker of the House of Representatives was delighted, who particularly appreciated the mention of &quot;the existence of evil in the world&quot; in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich declared, during an interview on the radio show &quot;The Takeaway.&quot;
The former elected representative, who some regard as a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration in the 2012 presidential elections, was pleased to hear &quot;a leftist president&quot; when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee &quot;that they would not be free or free. they could award a peace prize if the recourse to force did not exist. &quot;
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush&#39;s speeches and current Washington Post chronicler, Obama delivered &quot;a very American speech.&quot;
Besides presenting himself as a &quot;citizen of the world&quot;, as he &quot;always does&quot;, &quot;he spoke like an American president&quot; when reminding Europeans &quot;that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it&quot;, Gerson stated.
Among the few unconvinced on the right, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech &quot;drab, pretentious and uninspired&quot; on the National Review Online website.
To the president&#39;s left, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his speech a &quot;blockbuster&quot; especially for a speaker known for his talents.
The Oslo speech &quot;should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,&quot; the Californian newspaper enthused.
Obama &quot;delivered the speech that was necessary,&quot; estimated the New York Times, judging it &quot;both bleak and uplifting.&quot;
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to guarantee the Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that puts an end to the slogan of strike and to the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, Secretary of State for Transportation Dominique Bussereau was &quot;pleased&quot; by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in the hope of quickly signing the agreement text late in the morning.
Even when three employers&#39; organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew slamming the door.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text is signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict &quot;would have been very damaging to companies&quot; and &quot;it was feared that it would disrupt the end of the year festivities,&quot; Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest salaries (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It&#39;s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we are going to give the order to our militants that there be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be a dissatisfied rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is &quot;a good agreement&quot;, although it was &quot;difficult to grant increases to high salaries given the international competition&quot;.
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and that respects employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as &quot;a historic agreement&quot;.
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is &quot;an acceptable compromise&quot;.
The agreement also foresees an increase in travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow, above all, to address the issue of an extraordinary pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that &quot;a drop of 100 million euros in employer charges&quot; was the subject of a government amendment in the draft finance rectification bill for 2009, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it &quot;under the same terms.&quot;
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to the companies adhered to this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of Labor makes an extension.
It will be done &quot;as soon as possible,&quot; Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers&#39; organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a &quot;naive business&quot;, since the 100 million euros &quot;had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax.&quot;
The Secretary of State for Transportation forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but so as not to upset those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, Unostra lamented.
For OTRE, the agreement puts at risk &quot;the stability of many SMEs in the sector during the next 12 months.&quot;
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the RATP proposals
The conflicts on the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, because at the meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between the unions and the RATP management, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their request for a premium.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., at the rate of one train out of every two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers each day, was delighted that &quot;RATP strives to serve large stores.&quot;
The RER A crosses the Parisian city from West to East.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains circulated during peak hours, and almost no trains in off-peak hours, as had been anticipated.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platforms thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
In this way, at dawn, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less crowded than normal, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up &quot;an hour and a half earlier to be on time.&quot;
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, said the SNCF, which had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement agencies.
The RER A that the SNCF operates from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metros.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; according to the unions, of a meeting that was held with the management on Friday afternoon will be analyzed.
The RER director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
This is not what drivers who claim a premium due to them want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP even brackets its premium proposals, the CGT commented indignantly, pointing out that the management &quot;was not capable of solving a problem that the SNCF and the highway sector had already solved.&quot;
A new meeting is expected on Monday to carry out &quot;a more extensive analysis on the conditions of exercise of the profession,&quot; the RATP said.
Which also led the unions to say that the company &quot;did not care about the weekend users.&quot;
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who until then refused to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting &quot;to calm the waters.&quot;
The conflict could extend to the RER B on Tuesday, after the Unsa and the Indépendants have presented a notice.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros in premiums, for alternate shift schedules, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country&#39;s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended a hand to the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the &quot;focus of activities that undermined the independence of the State and its indivisible unity&quot;, the president of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party&#39;s leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and deputy Aysel Tugluk , they are cut off from political life for five years.
Likewise, the judge announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party&#39;s assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that the deputies would leave Parliament before being parliamentarians without partisan label.
The decision comes as a result of a procedure launched by the Supreme Court prosecutor, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, in 2007, which accuses the DTP of obeying the &quot;principles&quot; of the Kurdistan Workers&#39; Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and by many more countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that it does not have &quot;organic ties&quot; with the PKK, but refuses to classify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court&#39;s verdict comes at the moment when the government extends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the Anatolian Southeast, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of the head of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan, degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large Southeastern city populated mostly by Kurds.
The Forces of Order threw tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while the demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails or stones with slingshots.
In Istanbul, approximately one hundred people also gathered.
After the verdict, Türk said that the court&#39;s decision would &quot;deepen the discouragement.&quot;
Turkey cannot solve this (Kurdish, NDLR) issue by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
On principle we are opposed to the closure of matches.
This does not solve anything, declared the Minister of Energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can of course expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
This Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is not at all something you want to make life miserable for citizens with, says the FES winter road maintenance director
But with it, your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time on the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to handle the snow and ice.
In this case the FES acts according to a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-stretches come out with large salted vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also the accesses for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts around three in the morning
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES begins around three in the morning, &quot;with this the roads are free until the rush hour traffic begins.&quot;
The difficult thing is when it starts to snow around 7:30 am.
&quot;So we have a problem,&quot; says the director of road maintenance in winter, &quot;because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt.&quot;
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is the turn of the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and back streets.
That&#39;s where the annoyance comes in, Brauburger knows well.
Around five o&#39;clock in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly dangerous points and cruisers are cleared.
In general, the FES could not take care of all the bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 10 pm to 4.30 am mainly keeps an eye on the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these quickly become slippery, the salted vehicle starts up as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In an emergency, the police can also call them.
The cradle of the dinosaur
The Tawa Hallae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with claws. sickle-shaped and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the journal Science Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea at the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they collected a total of the remains of five specimens.
A find confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name &quot;Tawa&quot; comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional find: &quot;Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found.&quot;
Other dinosaur experts don&#39;t quite share that enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, for example.
According to the current current of opinion, dinosaurs first appeared approximately 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, about when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as &quot;neck long &quot;and its relatives, and the herbivorous Ornithischia (saurians with bird pelvis), to which belong, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is a primitive theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt says.
For example, the researchers found evidence of air pockets in the skull of Tawa Halbee, like those also found in the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to the air pockets, the respiration of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa Halæ also the bones of the spinal column were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbagged theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of later giant sauropods also possessed air pockets and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers deduce that saurians first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages were initially separated and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa finds the remains of two other theropods not very closely related.
All three cannot be descended from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We think there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
Naturally, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group to the dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Your opinion could give a distorted picture, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while in other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic the dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species developed, while the kinship died out at the borderline from Triassic to Jurassic.
Success stories weren&#39;t forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the opponents in the area.
Success stories don&#39;t always last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also already evolved in the Triassic and since then led a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, in California, participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of the Goethe University in Frankfurt had repercussions around the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they &quot;reject&quot; the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, had the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike vacated last week, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damages, the signatories judge, do not justify &quot;the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command.&quot;
The eviction represented an &quot;unacceptable attack&quot; on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served &quot;to delegitimize and criminalize the protest&quot; and diverted attention from the content.
The board of directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
The teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
Young people from the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Federation also show solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for one&#39;s future, says Verdi&#39;s National Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Hessen&#39;s Minister of Sciences defended, however, the actions of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he commented in an Aktuelle Stunde broadcast on Thursday in the Wiesbaden province parliament.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of the students, they are evicted.
The Left has presented a motion, in which the Minister of the Interior is asked to present a report on the police intervention.

For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the &quot;Russian Silicon Valley&quot;.
Here are important micro and nanoelectronics research and production centers.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a &quot;Protocol of close collaboration&quot;.
Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov headed the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized companies from the natural science research center will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
It is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics consortia and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called &quot;Socialist Planning City&quot; for weapons research.
Selenograd (literally translated as &quot;Green City&quot;) got its name from the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were settled.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart Dimension 21 isn&#39;t set high enough at all.
For the supporters of the project it is simply &quot;the new heart of Europe&quot;.
The law is. S21 is much more than the downsizing of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate a decade of hopeless construction site chaos in the capital of the Banden-Württemberga region.
Stuttgart 21 grew out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which terminate in the middle of the city, were at that time considered engineering fossils from the 19th century, acting as brakes on modern rail traffic, since in the past it took an enormous amount of time to hook up the locomotives from behind. forward.
Roll over, stop short, continue the journey; but it must be done.
And that&#39;s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a way station, which is approximately halfway across the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava; hence the slogan &quot;Heart of Europe&quot;.
The S21 will actually be started, even though the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement reduction.
The railway terminals of course do not have more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with a tractor unit and a driver&#39;s carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new section built ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railroad continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the designer&#39;s computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The way station and road support are intended for the transport of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time there was no competition from low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first deal with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than truck transport on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are not good for freight trains due to the steep gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That is the official figure.
Experts consider that between ten and fifteen billion is more realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade money will be lacking at other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the widening of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the route has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport - through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the ruling on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the autonomic parliament of Wiesbaden, if it is going to present an appeal before the ruling on the prohibition of night flights of the administrative court of Hesse.
The CDU / FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to carry out a legal investigation of the VGH ruling, which is more than 400 pages long, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had substantiated in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would have to again regulate the prohibition of night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as foreseen by the federal government, would not be reconcilable with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until January 4, if it is going to present the appeal against this sentence.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the Nation&#39;s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, called on the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections. Otherwise this could be taken as a lack of words.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan &quot;We keep our word.&quot;
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schäfer-Gümbel, that the federal government would be trying through misrepresentations of the law and tricks still to obtain its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition does not want to act on the basis of a &quot;quick first impression&quot;.
We need a legally flawless decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been the claims of his group about the prohibition of night air traffic.
US banks repay the aid provided.
The big US banks shaken by the crisis shed their state ties.
The &quot;Bank of America&quot; returned in one go the aid that the bank rescue fund Tarp had given it for a total of 45,000 million (approximately 30,000 million euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a report by the US CNBC.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The &quot;Bank of America&quot; had raised approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had enough means, among others for the sale of items.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis gave special thanks to US taxpayers on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped us through very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the investment bank&#39;s absorption effort at the height of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also seeks to raise money in the capital market to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source of well-known circles that the US bank could already announce for this Thursday the increase of its capital by 20 billion dollars.
A representative for the Citi group declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick choice
In the end everything was faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF (German television channel) board of directors pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may present a successor.
Last night the union wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main ZDF studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this from the station, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also had an influence not to harm the director of the ZDF Markus Schächter more, if this proposal would not be approved by the administrative council either.
Schächter&#39;s candidate Frey needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote had not yet been finalized at the time of writing for this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender&#39;s contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender&#39;s removal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council already weeks before the election had indicated, that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument that under Brender&#39;s direction the ZDF news programs would have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this, in which political influence over the ZDF flagellated.
In the end, even 35 public law specialists had meddled in the debate, calling Koch&#39;s actions unconstitutional.
But it was of no use.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance philology.
Later he worked at the station &quot;Südwestfunk&quot; and at the newspaper &quot;Frankfurter Rundschau&quot;.
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, initially to the informative &quot;heute-journal&quot;.
Following seasons: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 Washington correspondent; until 1998 director and host of the morning show &quot;Morgenmagazins&quot;; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF studio in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional demand after the dismissal of Brender, who was still chosen this Wednesday as journalist of the year by the media magazine &quot;Medium Magazin&quot;.
The opposite of Koch on the administrative council, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the federal states should change the state agreement of the ZDF in such a way that the director&#39;s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a most politically motivated.
A withdrawal of political supporters of the ZDF control guilds was ruled out by Beck.
Brender&#39;s likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended himself to the board of trustees with a clever move: he strongly criticized the union for Brender&#39;s removal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, both Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editor without losing face, as the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under suspicion of giving the position to a partisan henchman.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded in any case to the liberals of the left.
College careers clear
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes related to education, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally relented. In a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the study conditions in the cases of undergraduate and master&#39;s degrees.
Students in the future should be able to outperform their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the burden of exams: basically each module of the degree must end with a single exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of the students, and it is intended to guarantee a &quot;real and justifiable measure&quot;.
The policy and the Universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between Universities inside and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to making structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor&#39;s and Master&#39;s degrees.
State regulations that diverge from this should no longer exist.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities have continuously talked about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully conclude a career (studentship).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: &quot;Each module ends with a single exam,&quot; says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university degrees.
With the &quot;significant reduction of the burden of examinations&quot; is intended to avoid the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the eligibility, as explained by the director of the accreditation council, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Furthermore, in the future, &quot;readability&quot; should be the decisive criterion in configuration.
Modules and content should be thoroughly scrutinized for unnecessary restrictions on students in their choice of ..
the courses.
Students would have &quot;the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and promote their own initiative.&quot;
These rules would apply to new races, but also in the examination of existing races.
These must be &quot;re-credited&quot; again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until 2015 to review all the races.
Those responsible for this would be 10 accreditation agencies nationwide, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is installed by the federal states.
Education and culture ministers urged the federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to adopt such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Platinum has claimed to provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement tutoring and student advisory programs, as well as strengthen exam and foreign offices.
The Federal State and the universities intend to have 10 million euros for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring a novel about the university law to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition it is wanted to guarantee the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all the majors about their &quot;studyability&quot;.
This Thursday the government and the opposition once again discussed the conditions to study in the federal state.
Apart from the praise, there was also criticism about the decisions.
In the board of directors at the federal level of the university groups Juso (young socialists), it was demanded that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out &quot;behind closed doors&quot; of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the education strikes, now students as main stakeholders should be able to have a say as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave her support to the students: &quot;We need the experience of the students,&quot; she said on Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the education and science union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union demands a legal right for every student with a Bachelor&#39;s degree to the possibility of accessing a subsequent Master&#39;s degree.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there will be enough study places for Master in the future with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a GEW member, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The Länder have to hire significantly more teachers.
But about greater access to the master&#39;s degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
&quot;Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrolled&quot; says the first line of a poem by the lyric Werner Söllner in destabilizing idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arrival in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of your language.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and later as a reader at a children&#39;s book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several prizes for literature, in 1993 he gave the memorable poetry lectures or talks in Frankfurt at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is director of the Hessian literature forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave enough talk last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about &quot;German literature in Romania in the mirror and the defaced mirror of their Securitate files&quot;
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement admitting to IM involvement with the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Prize.
Recruitment attempts had started slowly, in early 1971.
&quot;Therefore I am someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against the fear-provoking attempts of the Securitate,&quot; Söllner concluded.
The lyric Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania were shaken by a case that evidences the abysses and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as is known so far, not only an author, but also a victim.
Walter had played a role in his Securitate dossier, said literary scientist Michael Markel after Söllner&#39;s confession, and stressed the positive influence of IM Walter on him.
He had excused or defended him on every difficult point for him, Markel said.
&quot;I feel the moral need to make this statement,&quot; he said.
Söllner&#39;s statement in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, Herta Müller wrote as early as July in the weekly &quot;Zeit&quot;, having read her own 914-page dossier.
Those involved will surely have speculated and have known in some cases, what names were hiding behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the treatment of the files of the control by the Securitate is still quite diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather dragged.
Since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke disparagingly of the awardee.
&quot;She has psychosis&quot;, in the end they only interrogated her once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to show itself straightforwardly in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, unavoidable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so often when there is quiet guilt.
Why right now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner&#39;s confession leaves hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desire for knowledge and not so much by the allocation of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, it is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as a side dish to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it was The impression that a smartly dressed foreign service member was leaving a very nice Christmas celebration, at which the sporting goods manufacturer had handed out samples.
The man with the bald characteristic had hired a chauffeur, because he did not yet know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old drunk with joy.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work would begin again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: &quot;It is true that we reached the round of 16&quot;, namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3: 1 victory against Unirea Urziceni, from Romania, &quot;but not we can let ourselves be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against relegation. &quot;
The &quot;much more important task&quot; awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the &quot;royal classes&quot; in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Lottery
The knockout stages of the Champions League (first leg 16/17 and 23/24 February / second leg 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
So joy was limited by the sudden entry of Babbel&#39;s successor.
Not just the would-be savior, who had in a short time inspired the puzzled Stuttgart pros with self-confidence, a willingness to give in and a taste for the game.
I went to the players and told them they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, explained the soul repairer Gross his recipe for success that so simple sounds, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer worked.
He displayed a certain magic, accepted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, &quot;when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible.&quot;
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to injury quickly advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the &quot;phenomenon&quot; perceived with the proverbial &quot;fresh wind&quot; and the way of working of the new boss: “He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. &quot;
And this is what had obviously been lacking when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs above all perseverance.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also refrained from overestimating the victory against a defense weakened by lack of relays and totally overwhelmed by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0: 4 the sad awakening had arrived, Khedira gave to think.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal for the season had been reached, the other was still a long way off.
We still haven&#39;t gotten over the problem.
That Heldt did not feel like celebrating his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were again updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just Before the start of the game, he had conceded goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions made by others, and not Jens, Heldt faced harsh criticism from Lehmann.
He had reproached weakness in management to the board of directors, which had decided to change coaches due to pressure from teenage fans.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of a lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann&#39;s statements were &quot;marked by pure selfishness,&quot; Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the defender.
They will probably no longer be friends forever, the two 40s.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the substituted coach&#39;s team, the spectacle of great strength of play and battle would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had “a significant share in the success,” Heldt and Lehmann said in unison, and so did the man with the plastic suitcase.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Fiery duel in Bern: Time and time again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was taunting world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC association version beat American Kevin Johnson on Friday night to Saturday in Bern by unanimous decision on points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already a two-time world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had hoped for could not be delivered.
Klitschko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first loss in his 24th fight.
Before some 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters shorter, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was repeatedly dodging the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right hand to his goal.
Generally speaking, the bottom Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to get through the rounds.
While he was taunting Klitschko with words and gestures, his punches only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second fighter, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a &quot;horrible zombie&quot;, who &quot;does not know how to do anything&quot;.
At the weigh-in, the champion was provoked on Friday to remove Johnson&#39;s sunglasses from his nose &quot;so I can see his eyes.&quot;
Fourth win after Klitschko&#39;s return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a hiatus of almost four years, he beat Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time, and had regained &quot;his&quot; WBC belt, which he had previously had to hand over without a fight.
That year he later defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only received one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to reunite all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to Britain&#39;s David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall, in November.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company promoting him is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium, London.
The Kunduz case
Opposition frontal attack: the head of the green group, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar due to false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg / Berlin - Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has criticized Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) for knowingly misleading.
In Saturday&#39;s &quot;Tagesschau&quot; news broadcast on ARD television, the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said that the minister had &quot;knowingly not told the truth&quot; about the deadly bombing of two convoys. .
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the gist of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it was announced that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by Kunduz&#39;s German commander Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of intentional assassination is part of the federal government&#39;s Afghanistan policy, and whether the chancellery, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the United States. greens Renate Künast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, strongly rejected the criticism.
The foreign ministry had no influence whatsoever over concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also emerged about the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from SPIEGEL, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and had withheld sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it emerged that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report from a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert had requested in a letter that the matter be clarified, reports the daily &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung&quot;.
So far no response has been received, he told himself.
The ministry did not speak out on Saturday regarding the reproaches made to it, and indicated that this would be clarified in the investigation commission of the Federal Parliament, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
In the waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it occurs during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can indulge unimpededly into the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states while waking, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world to be a madman or a drug addict, or at least a maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or the drugged.
It is our imagination to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes blur the lines between dreams, madness and reality.
The dreamlike states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases we call them visions, and in the worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, psychedelic experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, states of shamanic possession, and psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine - has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear very frequently.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a &quot;great similarity of the state of madness with dream states&quot;, for Sigmund Freud, the dream even it was &quot;a psychosis, with all the nonsense, crazy formations, and mirages of it.&quot;
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of winged demons, with blood-red grimaces, misshapen, gnashing their teeth.
They are chasing him, they kick him with heavy flaming boots, they throw him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Strident and evil voices echo from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. plucks two cables from the stereo, ties them together to form a hangman&#39;s knot, and fixes them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump
The rope is released.
Let this be a lesson to you! The voices shout in a chorus that bursts his eardrums, &quot;Go to the clinic and get cured!&quot;
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population falls ill with schizophrenia at least once in their life; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common illness after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or mania. persecutory.
Hearing voices is especially widespread: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like dreams, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
Perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to him.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in their life
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchs, &quot;the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remain in principle as is.&quot;
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are supported by reality, distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers it is still a mystery why our brain pranks.
According to Fuchs, states of exception can lead anyone to temporarily lose contact with reality.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral illness of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role - stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when there is already a previous disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis by interfering with the brain&#39;s transmitter system.
When the brain gets hot
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says Lübeck professor of psychology Erich Kasten.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on your point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our heads), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer&#39;s and head injuries.
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or little self-conscious; when our brain gets hot, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, lovesickness or other exceptional brain states.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren&#39;t for those images and the voices.
Sometimes during recess, a clumsy boy with long dark hair happens to speak to him.
When she answers him, the other students look at her in surprise; nobody, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit of a strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she is not dreaming.
She is awake and sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next to her.
You can even feel their presence, for at least a few moments.
It&#39;s a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she is crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher - to his eyes and ears - is introducing a new classmate, while for the rest he is visibly and audibly explaining the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While she waits in the dark room for sleep, which is often late and rare, she cannot tell if she is awake or dreaming, if the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, appear in front of your open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he yells at the figures.
She has not told her parents and friends anything, they would think she is crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have disappeared for a year.
Since she has come into contact through the Internet with the psychologist Kasten, she knows that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while they will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is idle and is in charge of finding entertainment itself.
Sarah K., an only child, was scared of other children as a child and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he has called dad since he can remember is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, sufferers like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. “Every experience,” says Kasten, “takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real. &quot;
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special ability.
Borderline situation between dream and hallucination
In this overly conscious world, imaginary experiences often become pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful illness, but it also involves something positive and creative - insanity is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later cannot differentiate from being awake.
Dreamlike conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or illness, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, this replaces a very dangerous real situation with an own and imaginary world that is uncoupled from reality.
A form of borderline situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen, from Zurich, describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul-saving action.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on trips of several days after a heart valve operation including a heart transplant, while his body was condemned to immobility in the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by himself and visited strange places of other times: he was bedridden, an elderly man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watched over his health.
He saw himself in the early Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the snowy Alps and came across a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary events, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, this is how you describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of the mental trips are, many years later, much clearer, even in the irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug use show how fragile the internal reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Each modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, &quot;can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.&quot;
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow may come
Burda
The children will take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen has come up with an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been fixed as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
You cannot put your children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end the children and also the company.
Burda announced Thursday that he will retire from the chairmanship of the board of directors in January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This 52-year-old member of the Kallen family has been a member of Burda&#39;s management since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, he was in charge of the treasury and with it came the responsibility for the assets of the company. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over direct marketing, overseas, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the top of the publishing house.
Burda&#39;s children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen&#39;s appointment also serves to &quot;bridge the gap of 10, 15 years,&quot; according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With his eyes fixed on the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said that family businesses are not safe from decline either: &quot;This has always affected families who allow themselves to be infected by the desire to seek capital, who have misjudged and thought They could soar as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I&#39;ve never had &quot;delusions of grandeur,&quot; says Burda.
I don&#39;t see myself as a political preceptor in this country like Springer was, and I don&#39;t want to play Time in the world league, those businesses have gotten too big.
Comprehensive beauty
Everything - in terms of beauty and well-being - you could wish for, at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés seems to have proposed, which has just inaugurated in the Callao shopping center (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which is in charge of laser hair removal-; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis &amp; Tachi hairdressers; Marina d&#39;Or, which has a gym, or L&#39;Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a food section, where the tea shop stands out, with more than 130 different kinds of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while you contemplate the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to organize your own &#39;beauty party&#39; with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and drinking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities that Spaxion offers.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual &#39;trainers&#39; who guide the steps of the clients, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all begins by entering your personal password on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise table.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go to the hairdresser, the Luis &amp; Tachi firm has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm.
Varied necklines
Christmas is coming and it never hurts to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, have created the &#39;LIVE Office&#39;.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The &#39;LIVE Office&#39; (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will reach agreements on mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to promote what will be the transport of the future.
3 &#39;electric cities&#39;
But Barcelona is not the only city that is going to get involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
This is to promote Research and Technological Development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates with regard to the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at the European level and has active a series of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees &#39;a horizon of tranquility&#39; for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees &quot;a horizon of tranquility&quot; for the Spanish automobile industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector in the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has implemented throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
&quot;Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of the closure of some of our main production plants,&quot; said the President of the Government.
&quot;Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,&quot; he added.
In this sense, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3,000 million euros.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed both for the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, alluding to Plan 2000E, applied in collaboration with the autonomous communities and automobile brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed a 6% reduction in the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a &quot;strong increase&quot; in registrations, which grew &quot;40 percent&quot; in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from February 5 to 7, 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.

Hundreds of articles related to the world of classic motors that will delight collectors and the curious.
Participating companies will include, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of automobiles; o Classic Garage, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Skill tests abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding rallies, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and contests.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on a circuit set up outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not incompatible with respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system - baptized as i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved in its entirety.
The finishes, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All of these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we found that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
Also, the feel of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument panel and the console, we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a large number of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of what the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese has more than enough room for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a spacious boot with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-liter 150-horsepower gasoline engine and the six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its reduced noise level, for its performance and for achieving contained consumption.
And it is that although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, both for its high ride comfort, and for its contained consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
From the standard equipment, the lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates the blind spot, the traction and stability controls, the cruise control, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen stands out. , parking sensors, independent climate control, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, if that was not enough its equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bi-xenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disc loader, among other elements.
Conclution
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for its behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 150-horsepower gasoline engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us great doses of satisfaction every day.
Deluxe &#39;Premiere&#39;
LA covers the red carpet of sensuality with Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as &#39;sexy&#39; at the premiere of &#39;Nine&#39;. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our &#39;Pe&#39;, as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark &#39;lady&#39;.
The FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without the possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or surfing the net.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine named it one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is more difficult, really, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what you pay, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It&#39;s just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it is like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately search for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check their mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and is long overdue.
Yes, some operators have special agreements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a Ph.D. in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The repeated slap on the wrist by the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming rates for the whole of Europe has hardly had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin, there is a fear of using the data, and with good reason.
That a device like FonPeek (it is still curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wi-Fi) achieves this type of rates means that operators begin to think differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network .
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month to month.
And that&#39;s what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifetime access purchase option like the one Peek already has in the US.
Not because I&#39;m going to buy it.
I check my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle&#39;s fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the preferred shade of the American first lady.
If you already attended the inauguration of Barack Obama as president of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, you have chosen the same one to accompany you in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -green yellow with bright reflections-, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces -dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric-, and it was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States was following in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat the vestaur.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a patterned velvet.
The accessories have also varied: green mid-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a collected one on this occasion, loose hair the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had labor problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study &#39;Fertility and labor trajectory of women in Spain&#39;, prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey carried out among 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt in this regard: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of coexistence as a couple and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start living together as a couple earlier, carry out their first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
&quot;Women between 35 and 49 years old with a permanent job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting coexistence, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with permanent jobs have needed more time of their life trajectory to get them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of the children.
In addition, the type of work performed has a great influence on motherhood, although less on the timing of the match, &quot;explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of studies is another factor that differentiates the age of women when they get married and when they have the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and have their first child.
The difference is also maintained between women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years old, those with elementary and higher education became mothers for the first time at an average of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
&quot;There is also another division between women based on their level of studies.
While those with elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a condition prior to marriage and the arrival of a new one. son &quot;, details Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L&#39;Oréal Paris just added a new name to its coveted list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, singing the universal motto of &#39;Because I&#39;m worth it&#39;.
The protagonist of &#39;Joyeux Noël&#39;, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, thus joins other famous L&#39;Oréal Paris signings, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly (&#39;Lost&#39;) and Freida Pinto (&#39;Slumdog Millonaire&#39;).
In the men&#39;s section, the cosmetic brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (&#39;Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#39;) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline&#39;s partner in &#39;Lost&#39;).
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
The poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent gives away in &#39;Póquer de aces&#39; (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) some thirty X-rays of writers who have passed through his literary life (and, in cases, also through the other).
He does not do it in the foreseeable and fearsome genres (biographical sketch, life and work), but rather looking for something similar to the nucleus of ignition of the creative character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent does not spare scares or illuminations.
Besides an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and re-readings.
Here are some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: &quot;In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical drive, the same that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against unfortunate fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God.&quot;
On Samuel Beckett: &quot;Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him . &quot;
On Graham Greene: &quot;Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition. &quot;
About James Joyce: &quot;The &#39;Ulysses&#39; was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand meter peaks of world literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which a and again the best mountaineers. &quot;
On William Faulkner: &quot;He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of grandeur. &quot;
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: &quot;This writer picked up the insane cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to carry its echo deep into the night of the 20th century in its literary form and he did it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to worms. &quot;
On Dorothy Parker: &quot;One day she got down on her knees and prayed, &#39;Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.&#39;
On Joseph Conrad: &quot;On his grave these verses by Spenser were engraved: &#39;The dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life is very pleased with death.&quot;
On Virginia Wolf: &quot;In her luggage she also brought her depressions.
Her husband accepted with all normality that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
There has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness. &quot;
On Pío Baroja: &quot;What did Martín-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja through Faulkner&#39;s weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct the man&#39;s fame so that he could serve as her own pedestal? &quot;
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed her and our dog, a mestizo breed, rescued from the kennel. and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word, they gave him two kicks that left the dog badly injured.
Our outrage is capitalized because we do not find fun in a gratuitous attack on a small and defenseless animal, which by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that caused a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she rebuked these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since a madman who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at five in the afternoon on a typical Tuesday in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubt would be of much use and not to generate susceptibilities, only to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to freely mistreat a defenseless animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have been.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, mainly among younger motorists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is the only protection element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which &quot;goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day&quot; and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan &#39;To be or not to be&#39;, will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving the maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety &quot;is a constant concern&quot; for the company, since being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheelers, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safer products.
Light commercial sales go up
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market is starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units that were registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what is more important, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decreases, according to figures from the employers&#39; association of the manufacturers Anfac and of Ganvam vendors.
The good data, not osbtante, should be put in quarantine since the reference with which the comparison is made -November 2008- was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the rebound in the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, together with all the vehicles that make up the mixed bag of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light trucks / chassis.
Likewise, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
So to the restrictions that the closed tap of bank loans implies, other factors must be added, such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
Against this background and unlike passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs that are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that do not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, the number of operations has been eligible. been testimonial.
Just yesterday, Ganvam again recalled the need for the Administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial ones (trucks and buses).
The sellers association predicts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a fall in sales (of cars and 4x4s) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As it happened with the ABS anti-lock brakes and will happen with the ESP stability control, the emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while a grace period is set for the rest until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, due to the way they work, it can also help avoid many rear-end collisions.
What the emergency braking assistant does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects by the stomp of the driver.
But this one does not always maintain that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of automotive components Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not hit the brakes before the collision and half of them did not use their full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the other hand, aid intervention demands the maximum from the braking system, reducing the distance the car takes to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with these types of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with injuries to people would be avoided - when the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to slightly acting on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, help him by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In the event that it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been advised by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April -the Day 8 probably - according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this may cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
To this it is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining strength.
In the event that there is no agreement with either of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China&#39;s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold remains.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop their latest, and expensive gem, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, in the first place, the automatic roof that has been replaced by a canvas one with manual operation, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 &#39;fall&#39;; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, they gained 7 kilos more; riding sports bacquets another 12 and with the light 19-inch wheels, five.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door handles for cloth ones, the remaining kilo.
Although it is also offered with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test was carried out on a unit with the six-speed manual transmission, mainly on back roads in California, on mountain sections with really twisty tracks
His behavior can only be described as faultless.
The reduction in weight does not mean that the car does not hit the asphalt with poise.
Rather, quite the opposite: it has been a long time since we have tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, transmits so much safety when cornering, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming up his muscles in a low gear for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, to brake, to recover and to squeeze his engine again ...
What we ask. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced with the &#39;sport&#39; option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, already released previously in the Panamera .
The acceleration capacity is brutal, either from a standstill or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads we traversed with the Boxster Spyder was pretty rough, but the car digested the potholes well.
Electronic aids barely made an appearance throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, late in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, priced at € 70,831.
&#39;Bag Girl&#39;
Intimate of Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional &#39;starlette&#39; of the &#39;maison&#39; shows, the singer lavishes her bad face with as much stubbornness as her Chanel bags.
More than &#39;Bad Girl&#39; or &#39;It Girl&#39;, she is a &#39;Bag Girl&#39;.
Baskonia give themselves a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant 82-91 victory in their visit to the difficult court of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous casualties that Dusko Ivanovic&#39;s team had, and in this way they are at the top of their group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 PIR).
The Vitoria team knew how to make up for the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work, although they had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had a lot to do with the final victory.
The game began with a head for the Catalans, who were ahead on the scoreboard from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria citizens came from the perimeter already suggested that they had jumped onto the Israeli court with hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of 18-20 at the end of the first set.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alava team opted for the inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with whistles and applause on the return to what was his home, to continue expanding their advantage at halftime (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the &#39;minus six&#39; of Splitter&#39;s valuation already suggested that this was not going to be the best night for the Brazilian.
But the game, despite being on track at halftime, was not decided by any means and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitoria people that on their court not just anyone wins, and with &#39;Elías&#39;s hand&#39; pressing they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini were instrumental in helping the &#39;yellows&#39; turn the light (50-49).
More drawbacks
Ivanovic&#39;s men, injured but far from dead, needed to spin a couple of plays successfully to catch air, and in those came Mirza Teletovic&#39;s machine gun, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), which the locals managed to make up at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The people of Alava came out to give their skin in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign themselves and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic&#39;s men did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the game already had an owner and the victory was escaping from Tel Aviv for the first of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost resoundingly in Greece to Olympiacos and gave them the lead of group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the losses of the typesetters, especially in the inside game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the victory Greek.
The Malaga team was not scared by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and neither by the entity of the rival, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from guard Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the inside game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score around 22-20, minute 13, at which time an action, attempted to The fight, between the two American guards Beverley and Williams, resulted in the disqualification of both players.
The Greek team began to work showing its superiority within both zones, where the loss due to injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jiménez, were weighing down the typesetters.
Between the inside players and the Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with their triples, they increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible comeback
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, was superior and even came to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group leadership shake.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last loss of Scottish center Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the inconveniences, Unicaja for the direction and Cook&#39;s triples, and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because when Olympiacos pressed and given their superiority in centimeters within the zone, they were unstoppable.
Croatian center Nikola Vujcic managed to overcome the basket average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja faded, handing over the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can find out the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads for real estate, employment and motoring in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates user salaries from the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they wish to work.
In the week that the application has been running, the search engine has detected that in general terms the Spanish worker &quot;feels poorly paid,&quot; Trovit product manager Albert Ribera explained in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the lowest paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish one receives.
In the same way, a driver charges 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by the dependent, with 14,725 euros; and the operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought after jobs on the web in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya&#39;s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya&#39;s stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate would officially end.
Francisco Catunda, charge d&#39;affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that &quot;Mel&quot; knows that he must leave the embassy before that date, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
&quot;He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to find another destination.&quot;
The station also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the established deadline: &quot;My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the Brazilian government,&quot; Zelaya declared by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated when Zelaya rejected the status of political asylee that the &quot;de facto&quot; government presided over by Roberto Micheletti was trying to impose on him.
Thanks a lot
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant trend in the markets, once again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving a free bar of liquidity at rates close to zero so that financial institutions could buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its next week&#39;s year-end auction.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock market volatilities and corporate bond spreads have picked up again, although they are still far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the haven chosen by investors, causing a widening of the spreads of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s arrived and threatened a further downgrade of the Kingdom of Spain&#39;s rating.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral hazard who were once again trying to create a conscience on those responsible for world economic policy for having stopped the destructive effects derived from the credit restriction on the destruction of employment, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving day.
However, what happened in Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to rebuild power in the emirates, and what happened in Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from a default on its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What does make sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and make its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of transitional risk premiums normalization, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads widen like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If European spreads decrease and ours continue to widen, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s is an anecdote. When our leading indicators are forcing the majority of research services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, that they return to the load with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy. augurs much life expectancy to your warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although &quot;prudence, driver friend&quot; for now.

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades is being debated these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some hints of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50,000 million euros until 2020 and another 60,000 million between that date and 2030, provided that the nuclear power plants are kept open today in operation.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Of course, Iberdrola considers that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase generation capacity, but rather to distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the question changes and the power will have to be increased.
Its commitment is focused on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, of course, with other &quot;support energies&quot;.
Galán, who considers that the Sustainable Economy Bill that the Government has just approved is in line with what his company has been demanding, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies fight against climate change.
In his opinion, there is &quot;a clear long-term bet&quot; in this regard, despite the &quot;specific&quot; measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should begin to be taken now because they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling at ten airports
Ferrovial&#39;s subsidiary for ground airport services, the Swiss company Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services in ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transpired, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a collaboration protocol to create the Center for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance contemplates an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy and water management company.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a highway construction and concessionaire.
The city council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan supervised by Erns &amp; Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the Toll.
While waiting for their offers to be submitted next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortiums compete with a notable presence of European construction companies.
The group baptized as Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in the running, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The former is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the latter, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team the Northern Direct consortium plays, with the presence of the British Laing O&#39;Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn owned by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but entails a clear entry difficulty if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that the aforementioned Hochtief and Bilfinger have followed, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be a pending issue for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is committed to a geographic area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructures.
The Underground Toll Road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and dubbed Northern Link, is intended to link the Western Toowong Expressway with the Ring Road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along of 5 kilometers of tunnel. This is the biggest action to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The calendar set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would be opened to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its financing.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear notable fruit for Hochtief, who announced yesterday that it had obtained a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
The ACS investee will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This action will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will employ the German woman for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the King George Tower, 27 floors, in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were yet to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O&#39;Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometer-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia for € 64.5 million.
The firm wins this contract days after taking over the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In doing so, Alpine reinforces its tunnel construction expertise.
The start of the works is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will last for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore is awarded Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the Ms Rushmore agency for an approximate amount of three million euros per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that entered the contest organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA, which was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
63 million fine to France Télécom for stopping competition
France&#39;s competition regulator has imposed a 63 million euro fine on France Télécom for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programs outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the authority that watches over competition considers that France Télécom has committed similar offenses in the past and that, therefore, it is a repeat offender.
App store
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the wake of other operators and has opened an application store on the internet, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange application store will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its inception
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, which makes them the third and fifth club that have earned the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn&#39;t just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have come out of this cast well.
The white club was the third on the continent to earn the most money for participating, and the only one, together with AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also made the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions League, despite having won more titles than any other (five, for the four from Italy, the three from England and the two from Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money distribution procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each game they play.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for drawing (400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarter-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 million for the finalist.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also the variable payments, to which 337.8 million are destined.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four assigned places.
The champion from the previous year keeps 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played in this year&#39;s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday revealed the details of the share purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a ceiling of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public acquisition offer (takeover bid) for all the securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be paid out in 10 years and that would be paid with an interest for said deferral of 1% per year
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa&#39;s offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 directors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer, despite the fact that the Ruiz Mateos&#39; company affirmed that it had contacted the regulator.
If carried out, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible purchase offers and the legal ups and downs of its former executives, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
It is a newly created position that will report directly to the president of the group.
And it is not without controversy, since the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to the Salazar companies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds
Regarding the loan to the Salazars, yesterday the former councilors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Court and affirmed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their destination.
The CNMV authorizes the Paternina delisting bid presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the delisting bid presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation when it understands that its terms comply with current regulations and considers the content of the explanatory brochure presented after the modifications introduced on December 2 &quot;sufficient&quot;.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
Likewise, it has explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which may not be transferred in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been set by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions in current regulations.
New tools for car appraisal
In these days of storms and accidents, it&#39;s not just car workshops that win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the repair cost will be.
No claim is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be time consuming and complicated.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest IT tools it would be a matter of minutes
For this reason, almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
The providers of services and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by the manufacturers, and then preparing it and offering it to their clients in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the North American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the evaluations are made with their products.
The other firms that compete in the field of appraisal tools and the preparation of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data supplied by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car hits the market, these companies go to work.
It is a very arduous task, because each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle must be cataloged and its price entered.
In addition, a &quot;smart&quot; graphic image is made of each model where different parts of the car can be &quot;punctured&quot;.
If it is a massive sale model, the job can be done in a week if the process goes too fast.
If it is a minority car, it may take three to four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile fleet that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the elaboration of the databases, Audatex has eight centers around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized on specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in developing these databases.
2.5 million pieces of data are included each month, and customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the sale or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claims valuation solution for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles, and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for clients who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Afterwards, each insurance company, which performs thousands of appraisals, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its VIN number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared total loss.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, perform geodemographic analysis or know the deviations by brands or models.
You can study, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It sells, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or official manufacturer prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damages, breakdowns or car maintenance
The Gt Valuation Guide is your historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has grown at an annual rate of 20% in the last three years, and in 2008 they had a turnover of 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
For its part, Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 it was established in Spain.
According to company sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The worldwide turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will earn 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $ 1 billion on the stock market, and now its shares trade for a total value of $ 2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s benchmark index.
Online auction of crashed cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles or special vehicles.
The operation involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company&#39;s capital, which could be increased next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its clients, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sale service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scrap yards and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily advertisements are managed and about 100 new advertisements are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been canceled cannot be circulated again, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be registered even if they have been deregistered after some cumbersome procedures.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the part, create a quote and generate a quote.
Ease of use is an essential determining factor for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the estimate to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an assessment tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalog of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the client can finance.
Currently the company Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics are very fond of, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it over to see the inside face.
