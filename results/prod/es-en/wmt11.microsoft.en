What's the count? The SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new councillors of the SSD in the capital will apparently have to overcome the obvious language barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed SDP colleagues.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new SSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current coalition members ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary using Prague's political flower and cream during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proven that new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"Rather, I am a novice in Praguense politics," Culture Councillor Luká-Kaucko said during the examination of "collecting" terminology.
And as far as the veteran politician is concerned, karel Beezina reacted the same.
You might know the concept of golf hole.
"It may be the only expression of all you asked me what I use from time to time."
"If not, I don't normally use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the Aktuálně.cz newspaper last June before the SDP voting conference, the drafting chose six examples, in particular those that are particularly related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "prague's biggest golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "bull's neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "blind".
Three councillors agreed to undergo the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolinek, refused directly to do so.
"I don't get into these things and I'm not going to value how civic Democrats have fun."
"What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs," he said.
As has been seen, Councilman Luká-Kauck would supposedly not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bém, Roman Janousek.
The word "Voldemort" does not say anything to Kaucko; the only term he got right in the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck, who immediately adds: "But I know more about the news."
"I'm going to have to sign up for a language course," he jokes.
Karel Beezina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf hole the Blanka tunnel, but also the Environment Councilman Luká- Placha.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is, and Luká- Placha even knows where to find that character; He also suspects the meaning of "going to the bakery."
"I think it means going to a prague company"; Placha is soon unveiled, which is the headquarters of the Janousek companies.
Like The Goezina, it indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-Democrats there is no glossary so familiar of colloquial terms.
"I asked my teammates, but it really looks like we don't have anything like it."
"Rather, between us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or make word games with names," says the president of the Praguense SSD, Petr Hulínsk, whose party partners call Hulda.
"At school they called me B'íza, but I don't know if my classmates also call me that," he confesses to his own nickname Karel Beezina.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party colleagues, Weinert is Doda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D'dek ("old"), Rep. Miroslav Poche, with which they partnered before the misleading elections during party sponsorship, is nicknamed "Igrásek" ("playmobil") by some of his teammates.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hulínsk doesn't like to be called Hulda, but the Aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this Pragmatic president.
"The Doctor of The Rights of the Porras" he seems to remember that Petr Hulínsk obtained his doctorate in law from the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches," as published in a pamphlet
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They tend to be old, they can't work, for example, for health reasons, they're single and they don't have children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such a thing."
"Healthy young women are also not ingested because they assist in work and have children," explains a nun who, in the west African state capital Burkina Faso, is in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help prevent witch-hunt.
However, this has a catch.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," Die Standard warns of the disadvantages of written awareness.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, a neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a wretched cluster of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman ignites in the oil that is used for ritual ations.
It caught fire when the group wanted to "expel evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The devourers of human souls always poseed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease witch-hunt, the president still participated in it in The Gambia last year.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a wide-rant witch hunt that had supposedly been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, forsaever, took randomly chosen men and women among gambian peoples to the president's property in Kanilai," Amnesty International notes in its report.
On the farm, people arrested had to drink an herb potion with hallucinogenic effects that also caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay on the estate.
After international pressure, around a thousand detainees were finally released.
Bakala's tenant: warms up with charcoal stoves and signs a higher rent
The man, of old and reluctant, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zde-ek Bakala, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried some documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving a sentence.
All three of them have just been caught liberalizing rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 kronor for a two-room apartment with separate second-rate kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains, half-angry, half-resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which rated the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing them on how to proceed in these cases.
But in the face of this, man only makes one ademan.
"Everyone says one thing, " he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large liberalisation testing laboratory.
After New Year will occur with the vast majority of flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rental.
That's why Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "lab" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of Ostrava's four and, on Tuesday at nine o'clock, it was already full.
Right next to the gates are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up a number.
"Rent 2011", can be read on a bright button on your touch screen.
Pressing it exits the machine with a small paper with a number.
It hardly gives time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly couple comes to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rents.
Most people come to solve common problems, such as in the old days: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar issues.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava at the tenants' mailboxes of most of the 44,000 RPG-owned flats around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes on the cards an increase in the rent of between 15 and 38%.
A special window opens at the customer service center for new rentals on November 18.
"It's been running for a week, so it's starting," the workers in it briefly respond when the client shows up as a journalist.
Bakala's liberalization and old miners' flats are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already dealt with loudly and clearly by the Vice-President of Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the SSD, and now they are continuously featured in newspapers in the area.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
They didn't even change my bathroom dish, the man mentioned in the introduction vents.
According to the workers, for the moment more than anything retirees come to check if they receive a discount on rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special RPG offer.
Half of the February rent discount will also be received by the remaining tenants who sign the new contract by December 15.
However, the mining "liberalization" window certainly fails to dispel the avalanche of doubt.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, they only asked about forty or fifty people about the rent in 2011," says the window clerk.
In the meantime, RPG proposes on the web and on its planks to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If both parties do not reach an agreement on rent, an independent judge must resolve the matter.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed possible and fully in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
"Nobody's going to be judged here," says one of RPG Byty's employees, and a man on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5, 000 left for the meal; I don't have the means to go to court," he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he says.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rents still do not even cover the amounts needed to maintain the community fund," recalls Pavel Klime, director of RPG Byty's residential portfolio, adding that the sloppy state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for landlords, the main reason for increasing rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG it was able with rentals to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some details highlighting in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, or more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month," it is indicated on the screen.
I only increase the 400-story rental of the RPG portfolio by 38%.
"In such cases, this is an increase from extremely low amounts of 19.66 kronor per square meter," RPG says.
On 2,600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not suddenly affect rents, but will scale from four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see chart) back on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to people who sign the rent increase agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need day care
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with all the same to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of the employees of the Arch.Design.
The architectural projects company Arch.Design, whose studio included numerous well-known buildings of Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-guard.
Around 90 people work at the company, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and liners to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offer to its workers within the framework of its social program.
Builders and architectes in this way have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with the care of children.
The mini-guard was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of management, managed to secure funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-guard is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (an endowment of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to purchase the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding runs out (two years), the company Arch.Design is required to keep the mini-guards running with their own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and economy rating contributed to the submission of the funding application.
The care of children is in the hands of qualified personnel; In addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for care. The nursery currently welcomes children without an age limit, although most of them are under the age of three.
Since it is a "mini-guard", it can only simultaneously accommodate a maximum of five children, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual teaching and care, the contents of the mini-guard program are comparable to the usual preschool education program.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality teaching: from basic learning to school readiness, they teach to English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go see their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up school children late when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
Not surprisingly, this naturally generates a loyalty relationship between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of personnel.
The house of bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Look at Gaudí's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs are reminiscent of a dinosaur's spine and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of her skeleton-like shape, locals nicknamed it "the house of bones."
Its organic shapes, its striking colors, the novel use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the ubiquitous lines gently curved, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, you can see a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house seems even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
It winds and the twisting of the shapes continues to surprise us inside as well.
Wavy wood copies window frames, railings, door ornaments, peepholes and signs.
Casa Batlló, which is located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Grácia, arose from the remodeling of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
Reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in his plans of the project came ornaments for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
On the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá and the Park of Guell, where other pieces of it are located.
Due to its organic shape, the locals shortly after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motifs.
Gaudí designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange to tilt forty-five degrees.
During construction, Gaudí did not respect the building standards of the time at all and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although evidently in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the town hall was so impacted with the result that it asked for it to be corrected.
He resented, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather on the contrary: just a fortnight after the request of the town hall, Josep Batlló applied (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors was installed the owner himself.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely crossed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without being renounced to the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white and blue tiles covering the inner courtyard and skylights.
The game with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which instead absorb the sun's rays.
Anyone can visit Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the Unesco World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most recharged apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and expanded visits to the common area and attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of admission to the monument is not negligible, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly befriend a resident of the neighboring houses and visit you at home.
How to choose mattress and box spring: women and men look for different things
No pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality on a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the box spring.
First and foremosm they must be perfectly complemented to suit specific users.
During the election, numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and box spring are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" more slowly.
In addition, they tend to weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them around more frequently.
If the center channels are not properly aerated and above are on a firm base, they keep moisture inside. Mold may even appear underneath.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower, harder surface.
"Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here."
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes that weather nervous system problems, so they receive poor joint and skin information," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other clients, have long preferred memory foam mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimizes your stiffness and shape based on the heat absorbed or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing puts pressure on it; during the night, it won't spin like after a hard game.
He just falls asleep better.
Viscoelastic also works as protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of your feet to its height, i.e. between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
For single rooms, e.g. single rooms, at least 120 to 140 cm are recommended.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule can be applied to calculate the width: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk towards your elbows," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert from Cechu'alouník to dekoratér, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and furniture ergonomics for many years, a topic she teaches in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each needs its own box spring and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the sleeping boxes at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with spring interiors a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeter are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you settle on the mattress, you certainly shouldn't notice the springs," says Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of box spring.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe poorly and you can't wash your cover, which is often done today.
And, since every night we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime warranty.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, the sellers give a tip: on mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care carefully of cleaning and washing the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although zippered mattress covers are currently manufactured around its perimeter, so when opened they stay in two parts (something very important for washing and washing machine size!), their handling on larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a box spring, do you have a firm board?
Never!
At most for the beds designed for overnight visitors.
However, you should make (if you don't already have them) ventilation holes in the board and it should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-articulable sheet boxes containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fiber) can be used, although a box spring with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the lumbar sheets are reinforced and their rigidity can always be regulated.
Articulable sheet springs should not be used with a spring mattress as it does not react to recline.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets in such a way that they "surround" the shoulders perfectly during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "male", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember the women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are springs with cross structure or tablets with the so-called multi-torque damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also keep in mind that even if you use the right mattress and box spring, if you use a bad pillow (large and "fluffy"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, which is normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on its side, the pillow should be on the same level (when combined with the shoulder-reinforced box spring or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do with the original mattresses stuffed with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, organic mattresses are fashionable.
Petroleum-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, such as castor or soybeans.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr Vasí-ek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh aroma of forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with vegetable extracts of breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "heat" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel more warmth.
Currently favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidity of cold and viscoelastic foam allows to manufacture mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand kronor up.
Those who play a therapeutic function tend to have lower VAT, as they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's hard to save on mattresses and sleeping boxes.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 kronor.
The second is obtained for free.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially it emerged as material for NASA, because during takeoffs astronauts were subjected to enormous overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the warm human body exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used on mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and soothe them, as well as their circulation.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people tracking devices to control their children
Fear for children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track people's movement and thus contribute, for example, in case such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Ani-ka Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people were afraid of the case of the defunct Anyka and began to learn about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We're all trying to tell ourselves that it's not about spying, it's another means of reducing the chances of a tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's purse without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bosková warns of the fact that if the child doesn't want to wear it, she'll just throw it away.
"Even younger children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"Before, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," says Bosková.
In its view, it is debatable whether in the event of an attack such a device is really useful.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the author will practically always check if the child is carrying any kind of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices spreads, it will also look for them, since their sale will certainly be done with a lot of advertising."
"In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police," she says.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the event of an impromptu attack by a pedophile.
According to THE RC Monitoring company's Robert Eech, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
"You can set the device to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If it is damaged, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most expensive devices have a tilt meter integrated, so if the person simply slips and sits still, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," says Eech.
In his view, such a service can be obtained even with mobile phones with navigation, where only special software should be installed.
The problem with today's tracking units is that at the moment these are devices that are similar in size to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they may be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, for this reason tests are currently being carried out on devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential aggressor may not identify the device."
"Or identify him after a certain amount of time, which can make the police gain time," he adds.
Even if tracking devices are worn on your wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
This is the position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough fuses to surround the entire Czech Republic. But they only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of fuse to ignite explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of wick to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stock for 225 years.
The problem is that the lifespan of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosives fuse from STV Group, a.s. for forty million kronor.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick by saying that soldiers need 60 kilometres of wick training per year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, with which MF DNES contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, they should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives each year also all generals, high-command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want to exempt e single Defense Minister Alexandr Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spends sixty kilometers of wick.
Such a length equates to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it did, the army would have enough stock for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the engineering or special units) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally recently to Minister Vondra because they say they have little ammunition for various weapons, so even money shooting practices are limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also cannot comprehend that we are repeatedly bought such amounts of wick."
"But it's their decision and they'll certainly know why they're acting like this."
"For us, the army is a good customer that, as a company, we try to satisfy," STV Group's commercial director Jan D.K. admits.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejoek defends hundreds of kilometres of wick, also saying that he will have stock of this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, STV Group's Jan D.K.C. indicates that the fuse has only a lifespan of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, by possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each ammunition should be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of wick, it got a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometres," says spokesman Pejoek of the Ministry of Defence's purchasing center.
Just to compare: the annual mecha consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate world War II ammunition or left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only for just enough to exhaust ammunition before its lifespan runs out.
They decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wick can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of warsaw Pact-era ammunition as the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with which MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of kilometers of old wick will have to be eliminated, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I'm still living out of the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest assisted Luká-Pytloun in selling his hotel's franchises.
The last edition won the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Luká Pytloun de Liberec.
His success story looks like he's out of a movie.
Lukáo Pytloun loved to travel.
Overseas he realized that in Liberec quality accommodation was needed at a good price.
With the savings he collected with seasonal jobs abroad and a credit from the bank he bought a house that was half-run consisting of five floors.
Considering that he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
"Today, the value for money of accommodation in our area prompted me to do something about it," says Lukáo Pytloun.
He began renting the first floor rebuilt to foreign workers.
All the income he earned invested them again in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room pension.
Since then, in seven years in the business, he managed to gradually open four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and others are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," last year's number one entrepreneur said.
"This sale of hotel opening licenses greatly helped win the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' contest," Pytloun adds gratefully.
The victory increased its fame and popularity in both Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
Without a doubt, it recommends that everyone want to try a company that participates in the contest.
But he believes that there is no need to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
So far, he continues to live from the contacts and acquaintances which, without the contest, he may not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started collaborating regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in employees,
in total about seventy.
"I've seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It's by no means my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the whole team."
"Only it is my name that appears on the front page," Luká Pytloun says modestly today.
To my successor I wish a quieter year than we have had in Farmet
The euphoria over victory soon dissipated because of the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the victor, farmet may have already had the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Aársk, received the first prize in the last edition of Vodafone's "Company of the Year" competition, last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in ská Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition," says last year's winner.
The history of the Farmet company begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel's father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the embargo on property during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned from his position at the company in which she worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with her father of plastic piles.
Soon after, they began specializing in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among non-specialized audiences after success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers start to regard the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country," says Karel.
Last year it may not have been in Farmet just a sign of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for commercial performance until 2008 and, in part, 2009.
And just 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and start limiting the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously don't get rid of such a situation either."
"Revenue was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production, and we even had some layoffs," explains Karel.
A viable company must sometimes take even unre-popular measures.
However, they monitored the situation and maintained the company's profits, even if it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
However, where Farmet did not cut expenses was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence in the international market and obtained great valuations at national fairs," says .
Everything indicates that they've already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are increasing again, and with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expects it to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel.
A survey that reveals ridiculous rules
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He's already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was made by more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the commercial register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it conducts a check on the insured person's impositions," said the spokeswoman for SSZ Jana Bura-ová.
The objective of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations to be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year he is part of the business tournament of the publication Hospodá-ské noviny and begins to create a reputation also among the general public.
While last year's edition featured three thousand voters, this year it reached almost four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of papers necessary for tax return we will be at the top of the world," says Karel Havlí-ek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
For years, simplifying business standards has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic ranks 74th, or eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first held in 2006 and is repeated in the same way every year.
Anyone can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, during October, allows the public to vote online through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that receives the most votes.
More than a hundred were presented for this year's survey, in particular 105 rules and regulations that don't make sense.
The examples were sent by both entrepreneurs and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
This year's list of the seventy proposals is published on the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held at the beginning of November in Prague's Wenceslas Square, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, this event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kusel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continually challenges entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs each year that currently unnecessarily complicate trade," announced Industry and Trade Minister Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left in clear water.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the employer's obligation to communicate in advance of three days to the business office of the permanent operating area, intending to go with a stall to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that secondly ended in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the labour office by its foreign workers of work travel of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the so-called green card.
And the third is the overdue one.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
That is why this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Eco-friendly, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Contest of Hospodá-ské noviny is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of Vodafone's mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of the main contest of Vodafone Company of the year 2010 were presented companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write a separate article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between them, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, this is for example people with disabilities, in others the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists throughout the Republic was, for example, the pragmatic software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main funder for seven years to sponsor disabled children.
There is a stationery in Podsbrad that is particularly concerned with the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company of the Year contest finished third in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which reduced working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also granted because it buys priority from Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and administration activities have the least possible impact on the environment," explains business company Milu-e Ryznarová.
The head of it Enlogit in the region of Stí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; It also supports work from home and at its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Person in Distress scholarship, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says the representative of the company Ondsej Such.
They are also well placed with a mention of the laundry company Praní a 'i't-ní of the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that have an impact on their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transportation, improved qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapá, from Bruntál Czasch's construction company, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the Company category responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest were automatically designated to answer the questions on the registration form and sent it by August 15 to the organizers.
Organizers removed forms that were not complete or erroneous from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the contestant companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Company contest responsible for the year, but are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year contest."
"Individual nominations for this contest are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Company of the Year contest," explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police made several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media businessman and real estate entrepreneur Lubo-G.
It appears that this attempt is to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land is received by an accurate interested party.
I had to pay Lubo G. half a million kronor for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen attorney general Antonie Zelená told Právo, adding that at the moment she cannot divulge any further details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police let the 46-year-old businessman go.
On how he could influence the public auction, given the little official information, there can only be speculation.
The spokeswoman for the Lubomíra Eerná Agricultural Fund responded to Právo's questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and it was during a public auction.
"This is a customer, not one of our workers," he said.
According to Eerná, the public auction is called "Call for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the land law" and is held when several stakeholders appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their return, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Based on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the largest offer," explained the Fund's spokeswoman.
He had information on who was going to apply for the call and, since he was both interested because he acquired various rights of restitution, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money on him.
He had special contacts at the Pilsen Fund for some time.
It was in the case of former PF Chief Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo-G. has just obtained from the Fund land intended for the construction of public infrastructure, particularly in the place where a large road to the borská pole industrial area should be built.
Afterwards, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the city council had to intervene because otherwise the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay an additional expense of several hundred kronor per month
Households will have to pay since January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rents.
Families will therefore have to pull several hundred kronor a month out of the portfolio from January more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas by about 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
Rising electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 kronor more a year than it is now.
However, major electricity suppliers lowered prices, as support for energy production from renewable sources, particularly photovoltaics, has increased.
However, the gas becomes moderately increased, especially when heating is most commonly used and therefore the consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also have a couple hundred more crowns per year.
While electricity and gas are steadying across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, pardubice or Hradec Králové households will pay about 50 kronor per month from January for central heating, while Liberec families will pay more than 1,000 additional kronor per year.
Residents of Prague must also bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially in case the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the praguenses will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be 7.4% higher.
Rental prices of 450,000 rented flats in Prague can increase considerably, where regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 flats in stí nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to court those who disagree with the new rental.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase next year by up to 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk on Fernet and rum. Beer is no longer in mode, because it takes effect slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in the hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors encountering such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get them drunk."
"Now fashion is strong alcoholic beverages," Právo tells Právo, the head of pediatrics at hoovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Ludsek Pelikán.
"When they manage to get their father a bottle of the cupboard, it may be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage of lightening with juice and not smelling so much," he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesperson for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"Those are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use schnapps they took at home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, they are drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years old who usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to Hoovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to go in maybe four times."
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 blood alcohol, plus a mixture with ecstasy," says the department's doctor on this case.
"He was at the fair in Holeovice at some dance party."
"The interesting thing is that her mother wasn't even surprised that her daughter disappeared for 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking on the part of their children that is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, there is no proper talk of dependence.
"An alcoholic means a person who has had chronic alcohol dependence for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it's rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment," Chief Pelikán explains.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, this year in the pediatric clinic in Motol, forty drunken children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who go with severe poisoning and should remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after the traveling medical examination, go home to the parents or the police, do not count.
In addition to cases where children simply gather after school and drink schnapps, for Pelikán there are three seasonal ups and downs to mention: Halloween, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink because of bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of the holiday."
"On Witch's Day, I've come to see up to seven drunken children in admissions at once," Pelikán adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and with the nutrients missing from the body.
"These take him much better, for after the hectic night, they get up well and nothing hurts them."
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelikán says, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they've generated.
Ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for serious patients costs a dozen thousand crowns.
"I have often used cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job so that you would earn enough to pay for that night," Pelikán adds.
Health insurance, in your opinion, perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually pays people back for treatment costs, does not do so for children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are first in the hands of others in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It's the first time such a device has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
At the moment, they were only abroad for internship or demonstration flights.
This is the two-seater version L-159T1, which until now used the Czech army and was still in a state of flying.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seaters.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the sales intermediary, Omnipol, already took over last week.
Jan Peje-k of the defence press department indicates that it is not yet known when the aircraft will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, with no additional investments or contributions from the Ministry."
"The two-seater L-159T1s were exchanged in their current state," he told Právo Pejoek.
He added that the army did not run out of two-seat aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract of 200 million kronor for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new aircraft was already received by the army in July, the other will be delivered by the end of the year.
According to Pejoek, EADS undertook to have the aircraft added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the one that withdraws L-159 aircraft and will serve the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
"So it's up to the buyer to decide how he's going to use them in this framework," pejoek says.
The newspaper Hospodá-ské noviny published early that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159s.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Home aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor were approved last year by Mirek Topolánek's government.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense direction states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and uses only 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
Buying Casa aircraft may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already reported the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by making a European tender and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at The Praguense Airport in Kbely in fourteen days.
A finger index longer than the ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest rate than annular are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger may be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this characteristic is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, As Indicated by Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, it monitored more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, at the same time, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indica finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same chances of prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
For men with a longer rate than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under the age of 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer rate.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pas, told TK that he knows the study, but that he does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "fully demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, dawned on snow-covered Thursday.
Roads and sidewalks are mainly covered by compact snow and snowplow machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road was closed between kilometers 89 and 93 towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was broadcast by the operator of the automotoklubu .st.edního ( .AMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck broke down, in 93 two industrial vehicles collided that caused injuries.
Several cars also ended up in the gutter.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must drive slowly after Brno at kilometer 190 or cross Brno and enter kilometer 182 in Kovalce.
Traffic jams of several kilometers have formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Traffic jams are forming for example in Prosek, although it is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the subway.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo námstí and Námstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, there will be another state of crisis in Prague.
Problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyno Airport was closed from eleven o'clock on Wednesday night until five a.m.
Currently, you can already drive on most roads in southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
Three secondary roads are closed to traffic in Vyskovska, snow tongues are forming in Brnsnska and chains are needed in Blanenska to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyskokov.
So far the connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kuserov and also Aaratice - Mileovice.
Milling machines will be required to clear them.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will be opened to circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, must simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to TK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfalls gradually subside in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" towards its victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with extremely precise aim.
His bullets are fired with a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, wall, or trench.
To be sure, normal protection cannot be used and, when launching your metal chip killer rain, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who talked about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point to it their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise sight point and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and pulls the trigger."
"Let's say 543 meters have been measured."
"When the trigger is pulled, the weapon is loaded and launches the projectile at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette says.
400 jobs are moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its bad homburg branch to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its bad homburg branch to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous marienbader Platz office building in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Strasse in Frankfurt's Niederrad district.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term another 100 other employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will stay there.
The offer is highly attractive, plus the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region provoked joy yesterday among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
Frankfurt's head of economics, Markus Frank (CDU), said he has earned a Global Player.
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site".
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger's mayor, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) laments Fujitsu's decision.
The management first informed the city of its intention.
"Naturally we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the computer manufacturer's good contacts with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in difficulties.
After all, economic reasons caused the fall.
So, now there's a big empty place to cover in the famous stall.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of Marienbader Platz's remaining buildings for ten years of a controversial spa town construction project.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive building that previously used the spaces as parking spaces and in terms of the level of the buildings.
In 2001, investment counseling and appraisal companies were installed, booking systems software manufacturer Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to Spain's Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originally from Tokyo, is recognized as the world's third largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The Rhein-Main-Gebiet branch is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries here will be Fujitsu Services and a company under the name TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenties, its name refers to its star-shaped plane, houses, among others, the central electrotechnical association and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
Anguish is increasingly taking over Wikileaks.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Political pressure may be found behind him after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly being held in England.
Wikileaks' disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently searching for an internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the Wikileaks boycott.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's list of wanted people, must remain in detention in Britain, according to one article.
"Wikileaks ejected from Amazon's server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the activists of the revelations communicated through the Twitter messaging service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon services website to cope with the high numbers of access to documents.
Via Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we will allocate our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon struggles with free speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, CNN reported on a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the senate council for the security of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I had wanted Amazon to take these steps earlier, before previous publications of classified information using Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate process puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," he said in a statement from the independent senator.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should assist Wikileaks with its service in extending stolen material.
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's list of wanted people.
According to an article in london newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact spot.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there have been threats in London.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's feared about Assange's safety, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of wikileaks founder remains unra unveiled.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to North America's statements.
In America, Arkansas' former Republican governor, Mike Huckabee, claimed that the person responsible for Wikileaks' revelations must be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to head of government Stephen Harper, clearly ironily, said on television, Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
A great dispute is growing between the White House and Assange.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has called for the resignation of the secretary of state, should she be responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than its website."
The American government needs to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was appointed exceptional manager, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "major structural reforms", which are necessary in light of wikileaks leaking.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American government announced that in order to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We've done everything we can to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
Ice cream college
The "Gelato University" in Bologna prepares ice cream makers at the best times of the year.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream makers has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
Gelatiere and gelatanium.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelatanium spatula removes the cream from the ice cream from the counter, spreads it over the wafer and sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic three-day course for future ice cream makers has the highest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses over days on chocolate ice cream and practices at the house's own ice cream parlor.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk in the gentle ice cream their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a teacher of this California art, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an enervante job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
One man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams in their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because his children love Italian ice cream.
Master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari explains to participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only its good taste is decisive, but also its silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream deck of the national upper house and mainly from the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step to the production seems very easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment cools it up to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and a pasteurized white basic cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a snizer?
How can you unleash some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises you to say good-bye to the trends of the time.
The one that talks about ice cream "not only natural ingredients", may have used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar bean.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a sound of granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, Master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients those purchased in the fruit section or in the sweets section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastas.
"All suppliers will try to strain flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"However they must experiment once."
Whether with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the cream of ice cream of the basic white dough, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and cocoa powder as the basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Course participants can now use ice cream.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut ice cream each time, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They also perform the same experiment with types of fruit ice cream.
That you know better doesn't necessarily depend on it having more aroma of tofe or more fruit puree.
Hazelnut ice cream does not need to taste like nuts if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the adored kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First a balanced blend highlights the flavor of the ice cream, Luciano says.
Ice cream making is an artetic problem: Peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar ratio of the basic recipe must be lowered.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra slice of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he sets the amount of sugar of the fruit types (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
It not only helps the utensil for the automatic processing of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously whisked and cooled to below zero temperature.
Despite everything, all automation stays out in terms of small pasta.
Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if it were an uncontrolled giant mini-first.
"In every course," says Teacher Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
European food safety authority Efsa has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently raised by the Testbiotech expert group, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of Efsa's expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years at the Ilsi association.
Consortia such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa's testing standards of genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
Efsa's provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms with documentation of Ilsi's situation and mimic the company's deed, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interest.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support or transition time to Switzerland's Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, conducted by the Office-General for the Environment as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data is used, also to some in the industry, provided that they are of high and technical quality, are sorted in a report.
Experts working at Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work to the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the U.S.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In this topic, independent experts, such as Then, criticize the currently allowing transgenic plants without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, makes maize genetically modified in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to only check isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?" he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
The scientist has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the U.S. and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That's why there are few scientists who aren't influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"Industry controls security research," Hilbeck says.
The Trail of stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was at Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind his back.
There were demonstrations
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September the bulldozers arrived and began knocking down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
Because it was sealed, most of the wing was debrised.
Broken into 6, 000, 7, 000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He gets excited: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he's going to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The Stuttgart Stone Trail leads to a forest in Tubingen in an earlier munitions depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He's bought everything that results from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, grind the gravel or send it to the dumpster," says in his office, a wooden house that was once a guard shed.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, which had bought the remains of the North Wing from the demolition company.
He spoke to the enemies of 9/21 for several days.
And he explained that he could do absolutely nothing for the takedown.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones continued to be used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram mazizo cut, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope that they could return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of momentum has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kr'uterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political component."
He ascends to his SUV, takes a tour of his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, was interested in computers and eventually worked with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
Transport your treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the biggest ancient stone treater in the country.
Braking.
In the snow there are artistic chopped sandstones.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrucke Bridge," he explains.
Limestone dawn, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
He points out a lot: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Nice place to stay"
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the grandstand of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine of Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite of the Church Sankt Blasien, toba of Heilbronner hospital.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he sculpted the stones before and moved them with a simple rigging and a wagon, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He hasn't become rich at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave to make the stone trafficker, plus stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a stained glassmaker and a gardener have settled upstairs in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the man who takes care of the remains.
Soon you have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
Talent struggle around great potentials
There is an active influx in the buffet.
16 students are slashed around buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of brainstorming contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Rivalling and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a hand-to-hand struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Your mission: Hire the most talented students of the universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And because universities don't provide publications on their students' skills, they try to glimpse and capture exceptional talents in hands-on projects.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium beats the talents.
A young lady from the staff department hands out pens, gummies and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the excited young talents the internship programs and student jobs and shows them their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University carries the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"In turn, VW can get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates, and consider them as potential future workers."
Some collaborations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are so directly desired.
"The main point was previously in the technical projects," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
But they have to be announced and, above all, to achieve a highly skilled workforce.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent trading situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineering positions in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineering vacuum will grow even further.
At the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a modern type of yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. the following year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice on the way out.
Only the creme de la creme of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the mass."
"The simple journey alone fell short."
For the Dykta headhunter the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, small and medium-sized businesses, classic with their job fairs, are also on the hunt.
"We try to get students at the specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sitha St.be, staff manager for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
He knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently 35 vacancies appear on the company's website.
"It's being very difficult to fill in the vacant positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several high schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that you can do internships with us or perform your thesis.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That's why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium usually can't offer it," says the staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, child attendance or good promotion possibilities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld is 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the preconditions of the employees.
The staff manager also expects extra points in her rankings for her aspiring work.
"I think the applicant looks especially at the external classifications of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to earn a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer goes through the employees themselves," he says.
In the jargon of the sector is called internal Employer Branding, also promotion of corporate identity within the template itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When people are treated well and identified with the company, then promotion is achieved directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil drilling
From the coast of the US state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in these years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby unwisely overstealed its previous plans.
Also facing the Atlantic coast remain new drillings for the time being.
This was announced by interior minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What led to this strict ban, which will at least be in force for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Prior to the misfortune that cost eleven workers their lives and caused the biggest environmental catastrophe in the U.S., President Barack Obama had admitted further drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
Supporters thus wanted to reduce U.S. reliance on new oil supplies from abroad.
To this day it has not been entirely clarified whose responsibility is for the irreparable black tide in the gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
An Obama-commissioned commission of inquiry will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, several peteroleros consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
The responsible supervisory authority, which, having been charged with corruption charges, has now fallen into discredit, is reformed at the root.
Obama announces in parallel that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total gulf extraction will be lower thanks to stricter regulation to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries," says the result of the current BDO advisory company's survey - before Wednesday's ban on extraction.
American Energey Alliance complains about industry insecurity: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects are soon prolonged, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
River water is black oil, smells like a gas station: Millions of litres poured of crude oil have shattered nature in Nigerian Ogonilandia.
People live on theft, corruption and the illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari thinks that's fine.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures reporters: "Enough oil will pass before your eyes today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys sniding in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost pretty.
You can't see brown oil stains floating on the surface.
Previously here he took prawns by handfuls, explains Esther Badom on the bank of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogonilandia, it is considered one of the most stinky regions in the world.
On the way to the river path that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown broth, which immerses its hand in the water, will draw some full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark liquorice sticks, sadly isolated the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain, flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as usual: As soon as the outside barrier is quiet, a kind of ghostly calm of an earlier gas station-scented paradise expands in it.
"What happens here is an ecological struggle," says Huraño, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
War comparison is appropriate.
The ogoni settlement area has been a snug battlefield for years: The first European explorers broke in here more than 60 years ago, the first resistance was organized here in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here the Shell consortium had to be placed here in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, companies are banned from returning to Ogoniland: While pumping more than two million barrels of black gold from across the delta region, three times larger than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines daily, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms covered as quirky sculptures of water: "Christmas trees" affectionately called the heads of the drillers.
They are up to 50 years old, most have total corrosion.
Every moment a head fails, Akpobari says, then a constant jet of oil flows into the water.
According to expert assessments, more than two billion litres have been dumped in 50 years into the delta ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the bird of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaskan Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the enduring environmental region will deal with it.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heads about to break and leaky pipes as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the world conventional ones, scientist Richard Steiner blamed the consortium in 2008: Only pipe defect rates are "on a higher multiple than elsewhere."
In one place, which from afar seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the free sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, flames a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil heats up in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the group's boss.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the vessel, later the oil pipe drips and diesel finally comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300-litre diesel daily: "It gives us 34,000 naira," about $22.
Delta residents take advantage of fuel shortages in one of black Africa's largest oil states.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per liter illegal heaters can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which truncated the network of pipes that crosses Ogonilandia: According to experts, at this rate at least 16 million liters of oil are lost a day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible portion of the stored provisional raw material is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best share in cisterns and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to population management or the loose way of production.
"If the oil companies did not behave as invaders and had not completely destroyed the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are shattered mainly by Shell to the point that only one deduction from the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as The Chinese one."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's about time you disappeared," says the muscular Lmann.
"Soldiers can come any minute."
If the army special unit catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, but with a painful bribe.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This damn invention has completely shattered our country," Akpobari says.
Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big security issue.
In an investigation of a machine that made a crash landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can lead to "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Qantas Airbus passengers who made an emergency landing in early November were much luckier than you can imagine: Australian air safety authorities perceived thanks to their investigations a major safety problem on the engines of some A380s, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a sleeve connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB authorities announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused "catastrophic engine failure."
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among those is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a crash landing on 4 November in Singapore.
Australian airline starts legal stockings against British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in federal Court in Sydney that enabled further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the engine brand they have lost parts and their wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines around the world have to be spared.
Australian researchers announced that they will conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said AtSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue has become important enough to inform everyone affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa re-set the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes traffic chaos
All-white Germany: Overnight it has snowed in almost the entire country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: In almost the entire country, freezing temperatures were reached on Thursday night, triggering traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snowplows are in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it's not ready.
In addition, strong wind gusts sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
Germany's Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 metres above its usual level on the Baltic Schleswig-Holsteins Sea coast.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in the city, actually the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold, strong winds swirl at it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there overnight.
Also in Saxony Anhalt, police authorities reported significant street unrest.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on lanes or shattered catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service served the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
Snowy winds sweep the streets.
At Germany's largest airport, snowwinds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information centre, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, there are already 40 cancelled flights.
Snowplows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few stranded passengers at the airport, yet there are 400 tents prepared for them.
On many streets, there were already many accidents on Wednesday afternoon.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snowy streets: Also here a truck was hit at a track crossing because the vehicle became stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after taking a turn with her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become softer and dusty and therefore it will swirl in gentle streaks.
But the wind will subside.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly remain very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank looks for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to one article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its Headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently fixed its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in Frankfurt's banking district; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium wants to look to take advantage of the costs of the round-up, and looks for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland states based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the project sale.
"We always check whether it's appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then re-rent them," he said.
That's why Germany's largest credit institution resigns from its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investor from a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements to it.
Energy reforms reached figures of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would be a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the newspaper's towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold at a bank fund or to an independent investor has not currently been disclosed, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people in mourning for deceased miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious at the site of misfortune.
Nearly two weeks ago, there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the site of misfortune, but did not discover any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment was able to come down for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
The bodies could not be recovered to date.
Today family and friends remember the deceased with a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shimmering glow of the sun in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They're silent for two minutes.
In homage to the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
Flags waved at half-mast before the country's government buildings.
New Zealand expected the miners to return to the surface "from the depths of the earth," John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, told participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He cannot assume his son's death until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose Zen son was buried in the mine.
Many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims.
In the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the island of southern New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, Gary Knowles, the police superior, told reporters.
you, warrior!
Does gore fit into art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the gender's borders with his "Walhalla Rising" battle epic.
What audience would Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A imprisoned Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and rip off his enemies the guts of their bodies alive when in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters get carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise they shut up and enjoy Scotland's beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes, which the backstage offered to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers grown and interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a movie has multiple groups of recipients, it's a shame they can't rule each other out.
Director Winding Refn regards his savages and the "Pusher" drug-dealing hairstyle trilogy as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with a little more humor in the mainstream or something less brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and sprouting guts can't deter most art movie fans.
Most fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo catches a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck forever in calm and fog before his team reaches America and shuts up there again.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of sometimes exciting cinema hides, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is condemned just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the grim trance soundtrack tie a knot in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a small blond young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents doom, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA nuclear power organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
Around midnight from September 5 to 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of Eufrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the bucket, hidden in a valley coming out of the river.
According to information from the CIA's U.S. International Intelligence Service in late April 2008, a running reactor is designed under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique is hardly suitable for purposes other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the inside.
The reactor had been up and running for a short time, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, he is hardly better known than at the time, the riddles became greater over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoir that before the attack the CIA was absolutely certain that Syrians had built a reactor in el-Kibar, but that he saw little indication that "a nuclear weapons program" existed in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an "alleged reactor," although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible."
They lack solid evidence as well as the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat responded in the summer lapidaryly that the IAEA has "enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians quickly got rid of the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and paved the ground conscientiously.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium dreadlocks in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, from commercial vendors at the time just after the attack, which must have a higher informational value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after particle analysis.
Since then Damaskus has refused to argue about it, as well as with regard to satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection at the-Kibar and entry into the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also remains strictly silent.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, the prime minister in office at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not paid off since June 2008 and "progressively becomes a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a high-ranking Western diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation of the atomic non-proliferation treaty, which the IAEA is ultimately pending.
The IAEA sees three more equipment as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor, and others as these still exist.
Inspectors have not publicly disclosed until the time of what equipment is being treated, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper S.ddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as an intern, again derived from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington(Isis) identified these locations and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite image imaging, most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria the occasion prohibits entry to all three places in the IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to fear a record the U.S. has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the teams thanks to warnings from the U.S. Secret Service.
Using satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three locations and the cube on the banks of the Uphrates.
A High-ranking Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the teams may be "related to fuel production."
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities," no uranium enrichment or overhaul; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should subsequently be separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are found in all three places.
As the hundreds of truck cargo disappeared from the ground, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IAO considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometres from el-Kibar to the other part of the Eufrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its aptitude as an area for radioactive waste, unlikely.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, related it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photographs from orbit show that Syrians made land movements in the three suspected suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be chance, but it hardly contributes to dispelling suspicion.
Moreover, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent a few months developing an inspection plan there, which Syrians allowed, to maintain possible military secrecy, only deployment shows the magnitude of the inspectors' interest.
In the meantime, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, is using so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who must propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but still hesitates.
This path is very risky: This requires a majority of the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat mused: "What if they finally find nothing?"
Love in the time of war
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her still nameless debut.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much else is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, which at the last minute moved some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims' organization wrote to UN High Commissioner UNHCR for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner's ambassador for refugees.
He is not diplomatic, weeks ago the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's position on it gives away the victims enough about the script.
Her organization, in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, granted after a tug-of-war recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not in spite of everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, enters with great effort into the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of war and give voice to all parties involved.
Its content remains inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the net that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the start of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the "rape victim falls in love with torturer" variant.
It's safe for Jolie's movie to really start before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Currently they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script remains on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like away from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish again.
No trace of affliction
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans scream with joy as loud music rumbles, hitting the ground with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in The Irish Cork, because players throw themselves, and find, pingpong balls into the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drinking game and the discreet computer don't really make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, get distracted from the fulminant question, what the future holds.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling," he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "in one fell swoer she gets the job of her dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, economic experts and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin predict.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
Forecasts are confirmed, there is a wave of migration comparable to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, nowadays melancholy spreads.
The economic crisis confuses above all well-trained young people, Irish people, for those who so far, everything is uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young migrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and thereby an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, law student and president of the Irish student union sees a bleak future appear because the government is only engaged in montages and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies for new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
Notice how his peers range from unsumed practices to the following.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the subject of working abroad.
"For those who start working, doing it abroad is a great opportunity, the first steps to running your career," says the manager.
On its website there are photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, but it involves freedom and fun.
For half a year, Seán O'Donovan knows what it's like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish comrades in construction in Germany.
Now they set up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he went to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime so he can pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as it's been a long time since he first stepped on the doorstep of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so well."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes around icy rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with manicured gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed for a credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions," he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I have no children to feed and I am young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he often hears today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is by far not as dramatic as in times spent here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps with it we feel for the first time as Irish."
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last major economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future pending and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's already worked in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend do well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that troubles him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says and gives his beer a big drink.
"Farewell, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a party to march, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime raises greater concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinbarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it allows to track changes in attitude in the region.
The results of this year's september and early October survey highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor prevailing in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in a number of countries on South America's Pacific coast (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a small 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a sharp decline in production last year.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44% of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25% recorded in 2001 (Chart 3).
About 34% said they trusted their country's Congress and 45% in their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher compared to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turbulence in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it occurred during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were affected only by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year to 32%.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since the polls began, more respondents in Latin America mention crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31% say that, whether they or a close relative, they have been the victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has fallen since 38% last year and is the lowest percentage recorded since 1995.
The most positive economic yields are reflected in greater support for private companies and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56% (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% vs. 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the trash
No one expected the general election held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than foreigners who were afraid to help the country go back after their problems were feared.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots lying in the sewers, electoral colleges destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Electoral colleges opened hours late.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "relatively good elections in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community stated, cautiously, that "we do not consider that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The election management authority, which according to its opponents is engaged to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The tiebreaker is expected to take place in January.
Not all hope for the election has yet to be lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the election management authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has little support, if any, has moved on to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic ravages the country and more than a million earthquake survivors continue to live in tents, a large abstention is expected.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
Some 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an essential step in rebuilding Haiti.
And, as has become clear, so do Haitians themselves.
Tiptoeing towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, she has enjoyed great sympathy among the public that has increased her popularity rate by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
However, whether it can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's election will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernandez leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who continued to take over economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend additional income at their discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death from a heart attack on 27 October.
Some discrepant members of the Peronist movement in power have confronted Mrs Fernandez.
However, after a chaotic session in which one MP punched another in the face and other deputies accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue, " said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to next year, which will give the president even greater scope for action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but many private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of trade unions, put it close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector, and had INDEC, the statistics institute, adapt official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernandez now moderate these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports worldwide.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs Fernandez is signaling that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Today, it seems that Mrs Fernandez is about to enter into an agreement with the creditor governments grouped at the Paris Club, which owes around $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF oversight, as is often customary.
Last month, however, Amado Boudou, the Minister of economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems like the prelude to cleaning up INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernandez wants to remain in politics when her term of office is over, bearing in mind that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If you do, you'll need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.

Half hurrah through China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible voters, came on November 27 to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma himself has become an advocate of sentiment for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but almost.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PPD), which has tilted towards full independence from Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes compared to 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential ones, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the town halls.
In the elections you could see the typical elements of taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with flags and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor was the mysterious attempted murder of rigour lacking.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man straight in the face, wounding him and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the issue of the continent itself was not addressed.
Instead, candidates talked about public accommodation and job creation plans.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China's military threat.
Therefore, the KMT often avoids publicity of its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the D PPD also avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma stated that it had been confirmed that his policy towards China was acceptable to most Taiwanese.
The Government of Beijing is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to get Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly like to achieve political integration as well, but first things first.
It's best to wait for the 2012 presidential election to pass for it.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on charges of corruption.
President, between 2000 and 2008, he openly encouraged explicit independence.
However, under Mrs Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything he can to show that he can also have sex with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be conducted without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr Chen interceding, the PPD will have difficulty choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT must also do a conscience test.
Mr Ma's valuations have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
Large samples from the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the Category of Revelation Artist.
Act at the request of a president and people will possibly notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at her Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the Grammys' surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the Best Revelation Artist category.
Considering that Spalding has been a acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives you something to think about, but respects the Grammy rules that he must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly was a breakthrough and, given his light and enjoyable vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythm influences, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the path to norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters , which have recently concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity," an exciting and magnificent record that was a favorite last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a raucous New Orleans favorite and regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably toward fusion as on the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Darcy James' savage punk Argue's Secret Society gained well-deserved recognition in the big group category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in Best Classical Album Direction
Nominations in classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations went to Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for eclectic three-movement orchestra.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo P'rt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are distributed into thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Mariinsky Theatre orchestra and choir; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Grammy-nominated composers for contemporary compositions include P'rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
The Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for Avi Avital, which performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with Sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez was nominated in the orchestral role category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees for vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets approval from the ordering committee
The mosque project for Temecula has gained unanimous support from the local law commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimonies.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and traffic jams.
However, the members of the commission decided wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians, Jews or Baha'is, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I'm proud of it."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"They just speak very loudly."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time it was devoted to people who interceded for or against the center, about the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"America no longer exists," it reads in one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Freedom dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
Plans to build Islamic centres have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of nearly 135 families has been living smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted greater and better space than the warehouse he rented on a property shared with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, though it lacks to be a really 'alien' kind of lifestyle," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report featured in Thursday's online edition of Science.
There have long been considered to be six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Arizona State University's Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the report.
As Anbar noted, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, as researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, generated much speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicating the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements we consider indispensable for life may not be as fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element with another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's institute of astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one with another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, it can be difficult for agencies to differentiate them."
"However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work as well as phosphorus, so it comes in and, to put it mildly, it appeals to biochemical machinery," Explains Anbar.
Researchers collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt to and use to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but demonstrating that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there may naturally be a way of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic can be replaced with phosphorus is not new, but an example had never been found to show that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early eras of Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there might be other means of generating life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Missing stolen dogs found in Compton
The two missing dogs of the four stolen in front of the Bellflower motel have been found, as claimed by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Officers on Thursday.
The four racing dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night in front of Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two met Wednesday afternoon, late at night, reported by Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape."
"They're back with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, nor the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't mean anything," Whitmore said.
"We're following some leads."
Dog owners Kristina Rickard and David Peek could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in competitions in the area this week on behalf of Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were to exhibit them in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly two-month tour participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their bedroom window.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer's calf, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van being stolen on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while MGM restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to erase approximately $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the 86-year entertainment company to focus its efforts on the production and release of films and television shows.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to be relanced under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a small studio.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In reality, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be financed in mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to provide advice on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron President and bankruptcy business recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial tribulations and satisfy the study's more than 140 creditors required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion the creditors were looking for.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially goes bankrupt in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multimillion-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been raising $375,000 per month for their company management services, will receive "success fees" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which premiered only one film this year, and assembled an annual slate of seven or eight films to be 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros. Entertainment.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to fix a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of its gift budget
While the iPad is the top candidate to be this year's most wonderful toy, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes of $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or approximately 48 cans of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy vendors, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see which electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's tech toy will probably have more power, costing the same thing and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with partner websites, two of this type's best-known, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button-powered toys are increasing, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated).
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and older) are guinea pig-sized stuffed toys that sing a note when their bellies are squeezed.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to assemble a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you cannot stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift-shift games like Simóm Dice, and can make the lunar pass, thanks to its innovative wheeled articulated feet with locking device.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're an 80s kid, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a mindful self-correction exercise book.
If you are wary of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, 3-8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; Although the games don't teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years old), it's the first major tune-up in the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter display.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, 3-7) uses an iTunes-type system to present games and eBooks, and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to assemble words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it's formidable for a makeshift word-armed competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These may include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than your toothbrush bristle, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the ultimate in a line of button stack-powered microrobots.
The fake insect moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find your way out.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of China's peacekeeping is promoted
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, harshly inspecting the nervous people in his care, issuing orders quietly with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, the burly policemen of China's urban order, feared and despised for their capricious energetic measures and inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firm!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "What are pretty girls like!"
Four girls who barely spent their teenage years in identical white gloves and olive green jackets and tight pants to get attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed on top of the hair tied with blue and white striped bows.
"Personally, I think they look normal, " said Mr Tang, dismissingly.
"The models are cute."
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have an undergraduate degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, according to one report, 50 officers surrounded a discolous snacks cart, and watched him frowning constantly for half an hour, until the street vendor picked up his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical makeover.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the police cough a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's small respect for these city squadrons.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news outlet routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, hubei Province inspectors beat dead a passerby after using his cell phone to film them while disbanding a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published online, describing how to effectively whip criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a quarrel with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous clean-up."
Skeptics say the current approach is a long way from this.
After the district applied through a notice for eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district's ad called for female candidates from 18 to 22 years old, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features."
They had to have an above-average height of 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
Withdrawal at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
Female chengguans are like vases, she said, adding, "in addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to support that description.
But he noted that height demands were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it's a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not present himself.
"We can't let a lame person or a hunchback come to work here," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be right."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his red cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her appearance is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His dimpled co-worker, Xu Yang, 21, said "Our work must present the image of the city."
They also don't object to their time-bound work, they said, because they harbor bigger career ambitions than just driving away vendors in the alleys where they're supposed to confine their business.
Each morning, the squad faces about a dozen street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or tofu bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We've told her many times!" said Miss Xu as a saleswoman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning her bike cart with side dishes of noodles.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is about the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
"Very routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, mutinyed after the false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen chengguan police officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the time being Xindu has prevented such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike was screaming rudely.
The situation staned for 15 minutes before the bad-faced officers elbowed their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, remained behind him, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men 40 and older, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically, " said Mr. Li naturally.
"Most of the time it's the audience that starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign
The senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have exculpat Senator John Ensign from the criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he was "surely happy" by the decision, which came after a full-year investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plan to bring charges against him on this issue."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics attorneys outside the Department of Justice, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, email, and other documents that were first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get lucrative work through lobbying, to achieve The Silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton's job and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an ensign assistant, he was excluded under the law of lobbying for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, disagreed with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban," which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending government-investigated clients.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said the department seemed cautious in accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens , in the midst of procedural misconduct charges.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a advocacy group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don't apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's top lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him the department didn't want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we thought they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, which alleges that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to the Hampton violated federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through lobbying thanks to Ensign's help with Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff John Lopez contacted Hampton and told him that he was "crushing" the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokesman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department's example and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign is eager to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire appeal to target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the process widely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is ready to reach an official end, with the imposition of the jury-voted death penalty judge.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed briefs in court outlining the arguments of the appeals they will likely occupy to the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reports on the process, including journalists' extensive use of Twitter of mass media outlets, created "a circus atmosphere," and such widespread and immediate saturation with exalting details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"Based on what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead attorney for Mr. Hayes' defense.
Trial Judge Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying that the news media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was led by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of constal cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Sheppard case. Maxwell, who had "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the TV show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the form of communication from courtrooms, which is unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general cause for concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many of the topics outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which are likely to be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to testify to the reactions of potential jurors, showing them grisly photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defense attorneys say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
Jurors weren't kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of intense process coverage can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a recusal to the archived verdict last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually threw firewood into the fire of emotion about the case.
"The daily agglomeration of media tweets, cameras and reporters out of court," the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps state-round."
Your attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said the complaint that immediate news was more important than slower-delivered reports was a ludite view that would make the court's policy on coverage control weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said the appellate courts were often drawn to the adaptation arguments required in court due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the Supreme Court's 1966 decision, which overturns Dr. Sheppard's conviction due to coverage of the process, and made it clear that they would demand that new means require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Sheppard case. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civics build a bridge to unite divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, a little civics have been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of genuine future bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders made no progress on the major issues that need to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences of the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to earn partisan points.
Wednesday's public meeting of the president's deficit committee was equally civilized, despite the remaining political differences among members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are on a period of trial, begging each other to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for renewed partisan warfare.
Which is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent evaluations of it by participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and Republicans are too great and too deeply entrenched to suggest any rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, expenses, healthcare or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the election.
Elections arouse party passions, which are then extinguished.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment subsidies, probably because Republicans cannot believe they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefit to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is greater optimism for possible treatment of these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new STRATEGIC Arms Reduction Treaty (START) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112nd. Congress meets in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement would begin.
"After the things that need to be done are done, in the short term psychology will revert the situation to a confrontational one," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civics can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the main event of 2012," he said.
The motives have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the tea party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As aware as Republican leaders are about the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to fulfill their promises to cut state spending and override the new health law.
These supporting lines are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing some taxes and retirement age, and spending cuts.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, by their own assessment, have forging the issue of deficits on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes on the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they've been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected on the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there are at least currently little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between White House Republicans and Congressional Republicans.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on budget, taxes, and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would bring about change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a slash, as happened in 1995, then both parties will look closely at people's reaction.
Whoever they think is losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Congressional Republicans than there were between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked US document portrays Moscow as a paradise of corruption
Control of the city is held by a "kleptocracy," leaving some of the bribes and protection money it raises directly to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service are operating huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority," takes its share as money rises on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have systematically denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several lawsuits for libel on such accusations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he said, It's crazy, it's, a nuisance.
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of that it is the diplomats of a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of moscow city government with criminality have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to claim that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than as a government," the note states.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal and mafia world that literally means "roof" or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, MVD and militia are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS raises money from larger companies, and that police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, "explained that Moscow's commercial owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be patchy; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don't pay quickly find their businesses closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports on men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust bureaucrats," georgy Satarov, director of Indem's moscow expert group, said in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion per year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked at least as corrupt).
The revelation of the US Embassy note, which did not happen late at night Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation claiming that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it was done in such an immoral way."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a weakly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge fortress in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, sustained loyalty for a long time is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook here that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a joint court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, sentenced former head of well-known torture center Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among The Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among former Khmer Rouge, but they can't do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During Cambodia's Khmer Rouge government, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew Pol Pot-led government in 1979, the regime's remains and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that took place in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting the process.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, privateers remain poor and uns qualified farmers.
"These people have made few benefits after surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have the regime's utopian agricultural ideology built in."
"They were raised without any concept to do business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before turning to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine," he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to self-help."
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute leading leaders and those most responsible for crimes, but he has not said whether he will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This didn't do much good to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers are thought to have died.
During a recent embarrassing afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his house on wooden stilts on a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She claimed that if the court summoned her, she would not show up.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward," said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to rejoin the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea," 75 pages long.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little detail about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's link to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are unsure about the number of people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact," he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retains a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many weeds and covered in discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone salesman by the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last break, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its arms-qualified uranium reserve
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, outside a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations were conducted with Belarus in the past two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of weapons-qualified uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from anonymity due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the Obama-chaired 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was seen that it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal is "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have retained highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapon-qualified uranium) and low-enrichment uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of withdrawing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the task, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with low enrichment uranium research, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of armament-qualified uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested potential détente.
It was stated that "while welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish government did not qualms about CIA flights
The Spanish government did not qualms about CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo via Spanish territory, the US ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice-president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance over foreign planes that cross Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in anti-human rights practices, including Spain, there was a meeting between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council report "had taken Zapatero's government offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no qualms about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "caught off guard," Aguirre says on a cable.
Also the then foreign owner, Miguel Angel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited capacity for influence".
For his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors," without the declassified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments," Aguirre says.
In March 2007, at a lunch between the US ambassador and interior minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told him that "although Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they see fit," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the PP's action on this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general approach, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government," he says.
The confessed parricide complained in the network of the "burden" of being a mother
The young woman talked about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror a la gallega"
Monica Juanatey Fernandez is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she used as a young person, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two naturals of Noia, the Coruña people of which she is a native.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of his relatives.
The 30-year-old Galician girl began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get the DNA test.
It didn't take long for him to meet another courtship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, neighboring municipality.
With him he came to live together for a long period.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to poll the labor market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But because of the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance was fractured, that they broke.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: Alberto is very rare and, because I have come to work.
"When I told him it seemed fine, but of course, he now realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not be free to do whatever he wants."
Then he talks about a cell phone message he just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the kid with my mother, I'll pick it up when I get back," she says.
In May, he talks about the return to his village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because the 20th I have to show up for a job so I don't lose it."
He clarifies that if all goes well, he takes his firstborn.
"He's going to be with who he owes, that is, with me, and never in life will I think of leaving him again with anyone other than my mother," dubious intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was allegedly killed on the 10th, is supposed to be dead.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the kid) to some summer classes, and that's how I save some kangaroo paste."
The 17th, memories and complaints.

The populars would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent autonomic elections, the Catalan PP already has its sights set on the generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this training gets in those elections usually doubles that which it receives in Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalans won 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the CFP won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been nurtured by a transfer of PSC votes and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the CFP could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a deputy - now he has three - while ICV would stay with an MP or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular ones can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their release at the head of the Provincial Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and populars agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lleida and Girona, where the Socialists would not obtain a majority or possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be far-fetched for this formation to lose its representation in barcelona's Consistory - 5% of the votes need to be obtained .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can star in the overturning in the Tarraconian capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by officers of the General Police Station in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, he provided passports to different al Qaeda groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latter author of the Bombay attacks that caused the deaths of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus has been "weakened" internationally and, therefore, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the Al Qaeda crime galaxy so that its "combatants" can cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The destamantelada cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, hence in addition to the Thai services, other European police units participated in the investigations, so it is not ruled out that on EU territory they take place in the coming days similar blows to that developed on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) in Thailand developed another with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were the ones that ran from Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly robbed tourists of passports that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be in the name of males between 25 and 45 years old, valid for several years and without stamped visas.
In the media of the investigation, it is emphasized that, for the time being, no evidence has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay bombing, even though the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia about a thousand dollars were sent through a transfer agency that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP demands Mas to park tax concert
The leader of the CFP, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas her conditions to support her inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that she is summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and do without philosophical-sovereign adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to propose at the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that gives to have obtained 18 deputies in last Sunday's elections, more than enough to make hesed, because the CiU candidate needs at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition to abstain in the investiture vote.
A possible moment with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held.
And as far as the chair of the PP is concerned, to support an endowment "all sovereignist and independence speeches will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to slim down the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomic administration and the elimination of inheritance and donation tax.
Details of the negotiation on Mas' investiture will be handled by the CFP, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Geriatrics say deaths were not for "lack of action"
Owners of downtown Olot don't rule out their warden killing more than 11 elders
The leaders of the geriatrics La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while employed there killed at least eleven elderly people in his care.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's wish would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility compel us to assume the procedural situation of civil leaders".
In addition to the social smear that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the warden, the great threat to La Caritat now takes form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that she has since stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the order ordering the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - who suspected that in many cases no doctor personally scanned the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was dispatched by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, flatly denied this point yesterday and noted that "the lack of measures may never have been the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is not a single indication in the case that there has been reckless action by anyone other than the accused himself."
The one already christened "Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case he caused death by pinching an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed by helping himself with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to medicines.
Insulin punctures and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the tests that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the warden's demonstrations, nor even to the number of murders confessed, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change the way he proceeds after having committed, successfully , eight murders.
That is why they say that they are made available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday warning "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
Peripheral spreads have closed tightly and european banks' stocks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an lyquid market that just as it collapses recovers but motivated by closing short positions and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded to finalize the public debt purchase plan as ineffective and eliminate all extraordinary installment liquidity measures and leave only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend current liquidity measures "at least until March" and hold the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond purchase program and even signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they remain obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, May God assist us!
As at their May meeting at which they claimed they had neither contemplated buying bonds and collapsed markets, history could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a further collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, versus 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment behind Trichet's words.
In Ireland, figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assumed within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension for the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the gift of opportunity by presenting yesterday the plan of measures to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive employment sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as high as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bonus that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we expect it to be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing ability.
For Spain to ask for an Aid Plan would be a self-immolation.
They'd give us a liquidity line we don't need, the Treasury has more than $40 billion in available liquidity three times as much as in March, at expensive rates, and it closes you access to sine díe markets.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, seem so".
Cheer up, we can.
Eulen president to challenge Vega Sicilia board asked for children
The storm does not aolin in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, by considering it "null and void", the judicial board of El Enebro on the 16th, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and María José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute over control by the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services does not seem willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was decayed by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting on January 18 of this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next 16th, convened by the magistrate of Mercantil Number 2 in Madrid, has again opened the box of thunder within the Alvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants his five children to, through procedural arguing, in clear fraud of law and abuse of rights, try to validate and heal the board radically null and void of January 18", according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the board, once the board has been held, to proceed with its challenge on the basis that it is "null and void".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to get the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a wealth company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Alvarez's seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claims usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the fundamental issue that the judge must decide once the hearing on the challenge claim is held, for which there is not yet a stated date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the formula one world in 2004, his story in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last few seasons, last November, in the final stretch of the championship all bet on the triumph of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without detracting from the skill as a driver of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the formula world has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula One factory has enabled Red Bull to design and implement "in a few hours, almost real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during racing and testing.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
Siemens' manager explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's carbies with the exception of the engine, which is Renault's sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the $40 million figure that each Formula One team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its carids in a location about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happened there is considered "top secret".
The squad for this task is 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero is arguably recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, are other protagonists whose contest is invaluable and their zero notoriety.
The factory's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&amp;D advances in wagon cars brought 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds up to 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing as they "are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to install 20 own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in collaboration yesterday in Barcelona is its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will combine this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain Vice President Helena Herrero set an example of the remodeled shop located on Barcelona's Gran Via, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has collaborated for 30 years.
The US group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to unveil the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The also director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of property staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, service, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program worldwide that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, as large companies already have contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing' a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other managers, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially rules out a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be attempted to compensate in part with commission rises and the price of credit.
Sabadell hopes to capture in three years a million private clients, his subject pending.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need for public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers - 700,000 if those who can leave the bank are neglected - their great outstanding subject, since until now it had pampered SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has recruited 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, and whose challenges will be presented by the bank when presenting the results of the financial year.
Few banks have in these times dared to set targets and make them public as the financial crisis has upset all global banking plans.
Sabadell, in fact, will close its Optima master plan this year, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the market situation made it expand for another year.
Customers who let the savings banks escape will be their main target.
At a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult and momentous" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is critical to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is shrinking, the price of risk premiums paid by banks and banks for their liquidity issues are already moving to the credit price to compensate for falling margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it's going to be a pressure on credit."
"We haven't closed the faucet, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto already gave orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and to lower the price of spreads - see Five Days of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that banking's tendency now "is to raise commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell's management plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not for nothing, he says that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
"Next year it's going to move everything," he said.
It asserts that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out any Spanish financial institution entering red numbers.
He points out that the FROB can supplement the market in fundraising in the face of further recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, he downplayed what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
THE CECA's CEO, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that there will be a wave of savings bank mergers and again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being implemented.
When the merger process of Spanish savings banks began, several entities ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and would be reserved for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday said that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been made, the addition of Cajasol to the Civic Banking group can't be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments."
"Most of it is completely done; instead of 17 of us, we may go to 13 or 14 but all the great processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot as well," the manager said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has explained that the concentration process is taking place "at the fastest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it occurs in the deadlines that in its day, not now, were marked in business plans with the Bank of Spain" Emphasized.
"Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volumes to 17 million with 75.5 billion is an unparalleled process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much larger to meet Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a rather unlucky series of opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The CECA's CEO, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The manager noted that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the fastest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spanish banking went very well to stop the ECB's stress tests in July.
Shoemaker and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private agencies of placement or deletion of the 426 euros of aid to the unsused, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How do we interpret those movements?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with that of maintaining the ancient traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now seems like science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the transgressive countries, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defining for a long time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government pulled a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans for fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the forehead was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were very much against Greece's bailout.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding reform of the Union's treaties, in order to make possible the rescue of a country while forcing private lenders to take part in the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But your proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should be attending the Union reform process that will enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he's telling us all that even if we now have to take measures that he may not very much agree with, from that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which infringing countries will be severely sanctioned, may be forced to declare themselves in default and, in that case, the private sector will also be at risk.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
Another debt- and construction-based alternative, with huge balance-of-payments holes, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not tolerate it.
The sending is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand.
It's not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater peace of mind.
And let's take advantage of the window of opportunity they've given us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that order must be put at home has been made.
But the red line germany has drawn there is, and it doesn't look like it's going to be moved.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, abandoning a monetary zone too crowded with unseathed countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany can always tell us that it had already warned us.
Sport and law enforcement
Tretas like Alonso and Ramos' in front of Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly released by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about whether or not such behaviour is unsportsmanlike and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with a few minutes to finish the match (which their team already clearly had won), the two players deliberately wasted time in pulling out foul paths to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will already finish as leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the liguilla, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass card cleaners to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and the players involved with different financial amounts.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unintenritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen in the reported case is because it has been starred by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts nobility and honor, and which has sometimes been fined to its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any event, the debate revolves around whether such behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions commit law enforcement; because, in fact, they are actions that are respectful of the sporting regulations, but they seem to avoid their meaning.
The question is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that sportsmanship comprises is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not jeopardized, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these goods referred to in fair play is to prevent the team of offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
However, the paradoxical thing about the action of Real Madrid players is that it did not add to what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely his action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage offenders gain in the intentional mis faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the opponent is not disadvantaged or profited in the same match, as obviously the result of the action involves leaving the team with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage obviously is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first change, and also with this performance the players play a penalty match and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by card accumulation occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, if you go through rounds, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor making the most of what the rules allow.
In the present case, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without circumventing the punishment or fleeing it.
Although the boundary between wit and law enforcement is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises by two factors: because it was two self-expressions and because of the way in which the transmission of the guideline was carried out to provoke them.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture group Christmas dinners at BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th.
Self-supporting celebrations proliferate by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like nougat and lottery, with the arrival of December also come the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to act as an oxygen ball for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals , the employers and associations in the sector interviewed coincide.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year's calendar (when New Year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests in the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the skinny cow stage began, many companies have eliminated collective budget dinners.
In order not to dispense with tradition, many workers keep it paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, each other demands battle prices, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaiet-Farrs.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to predict what this month's festivities will be like.
"People think about it long before they book."
"He wants to get out but he's got the alerts on on the issue of prices," he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and remembers that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the strip around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A poll at various central establishments shows the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th.
In the Soteras group they indicate that there is a real boom in applications for that Friday, with the pretence of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the juncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more advance booking, even since early November.
"We've done our best to keep the same prices last year, with menus for everyone from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detail.
In AN Grup, which has been in The Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 venues, they remain optimistic after detecting a billing boom since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the festivities.
To their six group menus have added one Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that re-invite their employees and feel that the volume of the groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the patron saint Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomo, hopes to start seeing the end of the tunnel and argues that together the reserves are "animated", although customers "negotiate to the fullest".
However, the illusion of festivities has not descended, whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistani nuclear program raises big concern in US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster rate than any other country."
Wikileaks leaks confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns raised in Washington by the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the illuminating and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and thoughts of Accredited American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on atomic security, rather than increasing, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to hinder their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the break-up in Washington.
This is listed by Pakistan Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as proliferating and reason to keep guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; Given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with their U.S. counterparts.
The latest in the documentation leaked by Julian Assange's portal is the increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassy office in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," says: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help are left unanswered or discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the head that "the Pakistan Army must end up with full support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileaks chief
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism man to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to track down movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it's hard to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it's not new, it's dated November 20th.
And it's not about the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks creator Mark Stephens' lawyer says that "police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day that the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at Sweden's request, but did not disclose it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, Interpol's 188 countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, as the organization has explained, do consider the so-called red notice freeway to proceed with an arrest -- which must be undertaken by the national police force -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as Sweden and England , where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founder of Wikileaks, 39, has been willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, to which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal chase," the misiva denounces.
As the world searches for him - and from Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange remains unscayed, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview with Time magazine director via Skype from an indeterminate location, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If you can show that you were responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, you should resign," he said.
His opinion was denosed yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about a guy's opinion with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counterterrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent further document leaks.
President Barack Obama's attempt to downplay Assange contrasts with views that are proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to consider including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and their funds and pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or help."
Further afield has been Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after saying that Assange should "be killed."
"Obama should make him a target and use a drone or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind punishment," he said on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with nods to carod like-mindedness
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to bypass the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of CKD, without north by the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation amago is insufficient for the like-minded to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is now as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not cause him the headaches he had with other extinct currents.
For this reason, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC councillors will be able to rule on their continuity in secret.
Through ballots, not freehands.
If the carers want to vehicular a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered ratified with half plus one vote, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The next to Carod demands that the president more than just make his position available to militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the highest organ between congresses.
But because they don't have enough to force resignations, they're going to try to agree with the executive on a roadmap by May.
To this end, they look forward to participating in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will put to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
Its intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for Puigcercós to promise to advance the congress in autumn 2011, something that the dome already takes for a fact.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" impairs stability and that its goal is to make the organization able to wash dirty rags from doors inwards once and for all.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the performing ministry Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideology of Puigcercós, the headline of Innovation took for example that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive to account for at least 90% of militancy, i.e. to include new faces coming from the carod-like sector.
The second may be the big novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assembly as a mechanism of operation at once.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession with the Puigcercós team, which already won in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave convulsive of 2008 left the commission to the management to review assembly at a specific congress of statute reform.
This appointment remains pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged the issue from being addressed.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it can be a good time to pick it up and try to close it forever.

China maintains goals of reducing greenhouse gases
His representative at COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supported its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emission by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, the COUNTRY's COP16 representative, said.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, it made clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He said china's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; building institutions and supporting pilot programs.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the adoption, last year, of a new Energy Law, which sets out the targets for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and governments of other countries, are underway, or have already been concluded.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficient Use Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the exchange of incandescent floodlights by savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country's government's scientific adviser on climate change, said China's efforts have been greater than is generally thought.
For example, he said, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the past five years and plans to do so by 2020, abounded.
Attached to the legality of Espino's expulsion: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what suits his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former panist leader is entitled to go to the National Order Commission to claim what suits his right.
In a pre-protest interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Hawthorn is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonoran Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to go, where appropriate, via complaint to the Order Committee of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he said.
On the other hand, he clarified that it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never on the negotiating table.
Nava Vazquez was convinced that National Action will be strengthened from the internal election of December 4 and 5, in which his successor will be chosen.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never at the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal," he said.
The panist leader stated that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; to the contario "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he narrowed down.
He said that the council will no doubt be able to elect the best or best leader who requires National Action for the next three years, hence it will deliver the stafeta "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute peace of mind and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the party president's office."
He predicted that the party's uptick in the last election on July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "this is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now, it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué on this task."
In this context, he highlighted that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a source of observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed on them, and I am sure Gabino will live up to expectations".
When questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his four-year speech, César Nava called on the priists to reflect on the six-year days of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; to start defending them; get out of the closet," he said.
He believed that the holder of the federal executive could make expressions like the ones he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no gag in the country, let alone censorship.
Promotes Obama on Twitter law in favor of undocumented students
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and encourage them to pass this legislation," the U.S. president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter social media account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and encourage them to pass this legislation," Obama tweeted.
Its brief message keeps open a cyber link with a broader document that asks the public to immediately communicate with senators, as the vote on legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs confided that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's plenty of time..."
"We all agree that we have to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closing of debate vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on from next Thursday in the Senate, though it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the past five years, and entered a higher education institution or army.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, so they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, at a time when party organizations of the project are lobbying hard to secure passage of the law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against it, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
That's why Dream Act supporters require adding several Republicans in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted republicans are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that they will not endorse it another time.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, hasn't defined his position right now.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of the Tongue was a walk where participants showed the narration
"I understand that sex on the tongue but... the finger on the sore? What is expected of me?" inquired the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates Spanish literature and that this occasion she used the subtitle of her question (at another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the Language, she explained).
The finger on the sore... "it puts us in trouble", the Argentine writer sweetly speculated to the public, mostly young people, who met at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that he dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "sore" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although she does clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist she becomes convinced: "Patience is not my forte, maybe it's my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated rapprochement with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the aisle, but who clarifies that sore is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the sore is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the sore I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very interspote.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delightous narrative entitled Praise of invention, where the finger on the sore is not named but at one point it is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues lost by a maiden, a narrative she turned to speak then America, the great novel to which her own chroniclers were not missing from the beginning and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the captains.
"Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told with imagination that was lacking until modesty."
However, he highlighted "it is the madmen and the liars who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known that from what is narrated belongs to one side or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
He is in fact called the 'Cervantine tradition'.
"By your inheritance we are what is told."
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero narrowed and applauded the variety of performances that the FIL's invitation gave rise to with her round table Finger on the Sore.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed hers towards the great sore of social violence that runs through her country - and shares Latin America - as a product of drug trafficking and sales disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a little commitment that of course is not premeditated," he said, noting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger on the sore of the writer's committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatsmos, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes".
"To own our thinking and own reality we have to nuance: and to nuance means many times to put your finger on the sore and annoy those who are much more comfortable thinking of caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and also to disturb the powers that prefer a black and white world" he said, inviting him to regain the sense of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far it has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up taking the runner-up's medal, has stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played back-to-back finals.
The Santista strata reached his first final as coach at the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he was wearing the reins of Morelia with which he fell 4–2 overall to Toluca; subsequently, in the Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a 3-1 overall and went precisely to Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, at the Bicentennial Tournament 2010, again against the Devils, Ruben suffered a setback again, as his team finished tied 2–2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the pennaltis shoot-up he took a 3–1 lead with two chances to seal the title for finally three of his players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 turn.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to have the same luck, he seeks to part with the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, because of a love to which I owe myself and as a result the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," the helmsman said when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very current has the previous final, from which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can't celebrate, we're prepared in line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties for throwing we were already ready to run away and I think that's a teaching , until the match is over we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal shots, something that does not concern him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the shootout of penalties, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move fate, sometimes because of the nerves or anxiety of having the title in our hands , but it's gone, that left us something for this final that we hope doesn't get to that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a runner-up technician and try for the first time the glory that the titles give.
US changes rules for visa
Individuals must go to Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
Starting January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will need to go to Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASCs) before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to make the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another one for the courier to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a one-time payment covering all three services.
The current fare will remain un change: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for requested visa cases (including temporary worker visas), and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People wishing to renew their visa will not have to attend an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain in the Consular Section for less time than in the past.
Likewise, those applying for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA will announce find of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency cited the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 a.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," sparking speculation from experts from other countries.
Discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures on par with us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently it is a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought too poisonous for any way of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will publicize the true scope of the findings at tomorrow's press conference Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's greatest moon), under the prospect that his chemistry is similar to Earth's.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it results in the arrival of 'bipartisanship', they denounce.
The 60 Legislastura was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' in the House.
Before starting the installation session of the 60Th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, convergence; Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza, PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'trunked' against reform to the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, starting 'bipartisanship', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panista Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his status as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo detailed that these reforms institutionally constituted the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He detailed that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be repackaged by both parties and with it the opposition coalition was over.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that Congress, having been monopoly, is now "duopbolic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipathy in Congress."
For starters, this group is starting with five legislators, and they're talking to other colleagues to make them more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that today Congress became a 'loot' between two, alluding to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're splitting it between two."
Patron Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the Member, to be given his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let not by cupular agreements be left out to 5 that we are probably going to make 9 Members, right now the five who see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they made that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
Mazatlan City Council pays another check to the questioned owner of an electrical equipment company.
One more check for just over 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, the latter check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "settlement of accounts payable".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Audit for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to it and, consequently, how many more checks are yet to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you are simply being paid what is owed, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the latter on November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Act marks when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
This, after July 25, Northwest published a review of the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos , through 42 checks.
He also transacted with Jumapam, where he cashed checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urge to attend tourist sites
They regret tourist entrepreneurs accident of the foreign tourist for bad conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced taking care of the image of the destination and reversing how bad tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and turn around nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a company one day and have no idea what money is lost, or else they didn't do the works in such a while and without proper planning."
The hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because it gives preventive maintenance and not just fall into the corrective," he said.
"We look forward to enjoying a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area should be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadito of Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come does not depend solely on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"Proper attention has not been given and this kind of fact highlights something that is notorious for everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgently urgent, as they are not properly exploited and project a bad image.
She spoke of a number of places that must be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive to be able to add them in the inventory that we have to promote the destination."
Ask Congress for IP results
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that Members take great responsibility for being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A working legislature worthy and free of agreements between parties and the state executive claims the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature, made up of seven political forces, 19 DEputies of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, which totals 40 popular representatives, has been installed.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly released 40 deputies of the Congress of the State assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because it is customary for them to make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival comparisons of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
Hence he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that bring the Ruler forward in turn.
"We hope that they will come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last election."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that will somehow encourage job creation."
Regarding tourism activity, he demanded that new legislators give him the weight within the state budget to strengthen the Secretary of State Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second largest secretariat in the state with the lowest budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with the agribusiness."
In addition, it is required to label resources to detonating tourism projects and to help to give security to the state and in the update to the Alcohol Act that they have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
A wizard king is wanted
Dolls, carts and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For his parents, the next Kings Day will be difficult to please his illusions, as his home is made up of nothing more and no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Elizabeth, Jesus, Joseph Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaiah, Joseph John, and Michael do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family inhabits a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"For sometimes we see her hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell mandarin and potato. already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He said (José Alfredo), 'I wanted this monster', but I told him 'let's see son', because he was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, schoolers, clothing and footwear would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is a size 12; Isaiah, 10, is a size 10, while Michael, 8, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the Campaign Wanted a Wizard King, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out as part of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"About 750 Cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security Spokesperson.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two Sherbrooke men.
Detainees had to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of production of Cannabis, possession with the purpose of trafficking, plotting and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests," says Mr Ruel.
About seventy officers from the Quebec Security Estrie Investigation Module, sherbrooke Police Service and Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can be fought smoothly
The Conservative bill, which, according to the government, should solve the problem of ducklings laden with clandestine migrants, will surely face great opposition, as the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
"I am here with a party that has created the granite you step on," liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow up to a year to be stopped by anyone from a ship identified as transporting clandestine immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
Quebec Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe also said he would not be able to support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against it and, it seems, all opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," Mr Duceppe said.
NPD's criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has downscored criticism that her party is not firm enough with clandestine immigrants.
"The Neo democrats agree that action should be taken against clandestine ducklings and that is what we are trying to do with another bill, the C-35," says Ms. Chow.
"We don't support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for a minimum of a year," Ms. Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused parties of the position of playing politicians and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take strong action," says Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government would request a vote so that every Member who will oppose it is then explained to their constituents.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Although the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit by Jean Charest had been announced, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation committee on the issue.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation on this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday's announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be said that, during a permanent Council meeting on Quebec police services on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the Quebec party critic dealing with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to describe this ad as "a rabbit pulled from the joker" and as "a last-minute sloppy solution."
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence over possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest is stubborn in avoiding the creation of this committee of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, it suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the interventor-general to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the intervener-general," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the interventor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing it to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent crew is not the only looming project in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Penal Code to better suit this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Security Vic Toews has confirmed for his part that his justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments on this issue.
During Operation Spring 2001 related to biker groups, even if the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed for the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Various watercourses are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon there was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a preventive measure, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudiére.
A road sank.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimetres are also expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais Valley were hardest hit.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimetres of rain.
As these precipitations add to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudiére.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurentides, and the Chane, in Lotbiniére, have already caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Region of Lanaudiére, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have dragged a temporary bridge.
As a prevention measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The civil security unit remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, as indicated by Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecasting Centre, for its part, issued announcements wednesday communicating the strong floods of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
They partially blame Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered some setbacks before the Canadian Radio Television Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as for its rude language on radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representation of Haitians, and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Council also indicated that the discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts disseminated between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of people receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were incorrect.
Presenters must communicate reliable data without misleading data.
In connection with the suicide, the present-day Stéphane Dupont had stated that suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"Most of the Committee considers that the episodes called into question by "Dupont le midi" have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate way."
Consequently, any blame has been dismissed in this regard.
The last dispute concerned statements made after the Haiti earthquake.
At the time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had staged a media showdown that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether those in need would actually receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already fulfilled my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio station has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, who must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of highest hearing within three days.
A kung fu king in Montreal
The Montreales of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar tour.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, climbs into the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has lived in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere because, for those who don't enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of UPS, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championships, held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I've won in the full contact kickboxing and thai box categories," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been making progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline native to China in which it is allowed to strike with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
Clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal must only hold one competition in his career, he will no doubt attend the big "King of Sanda" tournament, the Kung Fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China," explains the charming boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's largest stadium)."
"It's been an amazing experience."
Zemmal has won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who's beaten me is a real pro," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face off in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, that of project management, totaling 295 million.
The consortium, called the Energie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, recourse to consortia of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and eliminating competition."
"I mean, people, instead of secret, now do it openly," Quebek Party MP Sylvain Simard said yesterday at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the national assembly because he says he does not understand how the public interest can be benefited in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded in the afternoon, strongly denying collusion with this contract.
"I'm starting to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" and "lack of rigor" way.
He noted that "the least" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
Typically, it is a time-bound alliance that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge together to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
Work has already begun and will last until 2012.
In the entire case, the contract has been granted without competition being entered into play; negotiation has been discussed.
Moreover, the consortium formula is no longer the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortia in the technical advisory sector is under investigation in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial register allows more than 200 consortia to be identified, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, i.e. Dessau.
With regard to the Energie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular workforce dynamic and Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been granted directly.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the industry players and tell them: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people," Mr. Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Energie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, regardless of his participation in Energie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 uergie gérance contract.
Sylvain Simard has implied that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has dropped that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before rather without rather its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label doesn't inspire confidence
Greener, but deeply skeptical.
The Quebec consumer barely relies on the actors of sustainable development, fair trade marks or eco-certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Responsible Consumption Barometer, the first results of which were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where messages that advocate more responsible consumption are swarmed, but he regrets the lack of reliable information and believes that it even curbs his commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates carrying so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible," the Barometer notes.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians' speeches on this issue seriously.
In any event, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of information cause 46% of consumers to want this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, following the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers also say they are suspicious of the alleged yields on organic products or services they are being tried to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and especially changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have prioritized shopping in stores in their neighbourhood and preferred to buy food products grown in their region, the Barometer notes.
Greener and more responsible (the rate of responsible consumption has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), Quebec's Homo consumus loves to take the position of the king of recycling who tries to reduce its impact on the environment by worrying about wildlife protection.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness appears to be from doors (of their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just completed its first edition, support bike use and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris pos la Société Angus and paralléle cinema complex, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Paralléle, which awaited a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back from Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and return his true kinefila vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would, in fact, be less than the initial expectations; this could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and an application of 12.8 million, but since then applications have been revised down.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Francois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, forwarded a proposal and action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you one last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Paralléle and Angus have until 31 December to respond to it.
In any case, it appears that the hypothesis of a state donation should be completely dismissed.
Let us remember that the Quebec Association of Film Owners and Film Complexes opposed direct state investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, as it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector do call for considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has carried for ten years the burden of author cinema on his premises in the complex, after financing his own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Treasury Council.
The lack of independent film rooms is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The company Angus and the Paralléle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are promoting a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to make its way to acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these cinemas, the Paralléle, has continued to screen films on eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting Xavier Beauvois' beautiful film "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the down proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted in full...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadian complex with respect to Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter's sense of superiority toward Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canada-U.S. relations when they're going to vote and believe President Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government get their budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A September 22, 2008, cable, that is, during the federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This brought great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations about this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a inferiority complex virtually inherent to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
Thus, the United States concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to speak of."
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and, even more, the head of a party to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting."
You can also see this sense of importance the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, where through which Canada will first record deficits over the past decade due to a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion," Mr. Breese writes.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington of the increasingly negative image conveyed by the drama series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which uns subtle references are made to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the kidnappings for the CIA to conduct energetic interrogations.
Another cable says that, during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take in some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but that he depended "on every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that moods have warmed up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass escape should be "killed."
Mike Huckabee echoes in America.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount corresponding to nearly one-third of the additional decline that must be made to stabilize the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN expects to be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or, even better, by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or "LED") would be avoided, much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, large issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should still be reduced to stabilize, by 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is still reduced by two times.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
Above, they contain no mercury.
A number of specialists have expressed reservations regarding fluocompact bulbs, as they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers place instructions.
However, the report indicates, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluocompact bulbs, but coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits this international programme would offer each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year on electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it $2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast looks forward to the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast, as the deadlines for the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the interim results immediately," says a spokesman for the UN chief.
"He calls on all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the interim results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has let Wednesday's deadline go by midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday's count.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the CIS president had told television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, the Gbagbo side has had the constitutional council annulled "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the old New Forces (FN) rebellion since the failed coup d'eer in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the President of Ivory Coast, said that FN intimidation maneuvers in the north of the country had deterred the outgoing president's supporters from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo's complaints.
However, Gbagbo's adversaries consider the country's highest court to be non-neutral, as it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from spreading the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential round, on Sunday, should have put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the political class in Ivory Coast that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in Q3
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published Thursday by the Insee.
The number of parados remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
Second quarter data have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population on the mainland and 9.7% with the DODs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for a job.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has continued to worsen, with the new unemployment rate rising to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in a year), 25% including DODs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the age of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among the elderly, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over the age of 50, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DODs.
There has been only stability of unemployment among people between the ages of 25 and 49, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in a year) and 8.8% across France.
Since 2006, The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics agency, continues to do so and announced a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) on Tuesday in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, manager of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhane, is being investigated and imprisoned in Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, cover-up, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, her lawyer says.
"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and answer all questions asked by the magistrate, not ghosts."
"It is easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, had told the AFP before his client appeared.
Mr Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-Noel Guérini, wanted to transmit through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all his client has done is deal with the landfills he has to manage.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the fate of the funds related to their implementation, he knows nothing about it, according to the lawyer Simon.
In the context of this dossier, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the Aubagne urban agglomeration, has also been investigated since Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken into account the explanations and released him," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night to Wednesday, four other people were questioned and left to freedom, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as indicated by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General of Marseille Provence Métropole Property (MPM), has been charged with "influence trafficking and passive corruption."
Two Aubagne agglomeration officials, Micele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "abduction and embezzlement of public goods by a person engaged in public service" and for "complicity in the embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "covering up the abuse of social property."
Among those who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have been able to launder the capital of great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several court instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A close source of research points out that research focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: Elisha has exaggerated Syria mediation
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", has had the public in France, alerted to diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of America's diplomats.
US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained its strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and wanted by American justice for material trafficking for Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media into giving the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French Comments on How to Manage Hostage-Taking Cases".
Elisha's adviser on strategic affairs, Francois Richier, accompanied by Quai d'Orsay director for North Africa and the Middle East Patrice Paoli, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own foreheld citizens by force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "continually release" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often."
Because, once attempts at negotiations through discrete channels are exhausted, "silence will solve nothing," the Iranians are "experts in delaying manoeuvres."
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day he will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the iranians to be paid a large amount of money" (230,000 euros reward).
In addition, he notes that the Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that will "increase".
The Iranians could "in the near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is 12 days in prison, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States requests for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material into Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which closes Iran's underground networks of procurement of material for the nuclear program, Majid Khakavand's release is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Release the Iranian in exchange for the French one?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, Francois Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
The Elisha, he says, not only "has he been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Micele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot overturn the decision," he says.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of the French information services.
The Elisha's adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy."
During Clotilde Reiss's detention in Iran, the Elisha spares no effort, uses media-organized communiqués and "leaks" to make Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad believe he plays an "important" and "influential" role as a "mediator."
Americans observe this activity with some irony and see that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media blitz of French officials".
Why such "gratitude" is owed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
"Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what Syrians have actually done."
The document then discusses the reasons that led the Elisha to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he says.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been labeled premature and undeserved."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris is trying to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran."
The U.S. embassy knows it from a good source.
On August 11, Francois Richier entrusts him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we have thanked him."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elisha.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played an "active role in the liberation of our compatriot."
As of midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The South Korean government is going to adopt a law called Cinderella that will prevent teens from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family have indicated.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study in school and lead a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, ministerial officer in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, accurate.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games when young people's parents so request, the manager added.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests free software that allows to limit the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host countries
Amid the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, a traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), following a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests that are at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions may therefore last up to the last minute.
Moreover, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Hispanic-Portuguese (2018) and US (2022) nominations have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too important for the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the corruption suspension of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of their country, the birthplace of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the bonfire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has revealed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to upset FIFA and embarrass English leaders, who have launched themselves into intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government hopes to re-edit the successful blow by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had secured the 2012 JJ.OO organization for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's brilliance to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, ready, their experience (World 82 in Spain, JJ. OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could put down their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they manage to do is give points to Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the English press's accusations against EC members.
"They're bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems like the most logical favorites.
The world's first economic power and home to FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to take advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new nominations seem premature for two countries that have organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the 2026 World Cup award to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of possibilities by 2022.
Together with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be harmed by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had implied that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
A mandate in the Elisha leads to another.
The current head of state will therefore be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence of this does not well match the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always be seemed doubted.
One way and the other.
In 2006, even if they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "sometime in autumn 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the Members of the UMP, on Tuesday night in the Elisha, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some upheaval.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not at all.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
I was just transmitting the facts, not an ad.
It's not the first time he's spoken of the presidential ones, with a joque tone, in such encounters.
"At worst, or better, of the cases, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I won't consider what's to come next."
His claims the day before yesterday bring him no closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They provoke comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the fact that Ségoléne Royal has risen to the fore which leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be honest.
Rather, on the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people of the PS to demand that the battle be organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, bad probings.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer Francois Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% over 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject," the Prime Minister's environment has reacted immediately and prudently.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll always think he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of state letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should make it possible to specify the modalities for exiting the crisis or at least to announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, frankfurt's issuance institute certainly cannot afford to be so perentory if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be just as high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde endorsed the ECB's active role in solving the debt crisis of European states.
It did not mean whether it considered that the central bank should do more, for example increasing its program of buying state obligations.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans." ...
On the eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet was no more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the programme for the purchase of State Letters on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during Thursday's meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main unchanged rate at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's acquisition of Treasury obligations has doubled last week to around EUR 1.35 billion.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market operators, yesterday he would have bought Irish and Portuguese securities again.
In total, eurosystem central banks have acquired securities amounting to EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not forese any significant changes in course.
Although loan operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial conditions with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be prolonged today for a few months.
"I can't imagine you're going to significantly modify your program."
"Other words, I would run the risk of provoking further short-term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," he anticipates Norbert Brems, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations so that the market remains stable," adds Norbert Brems.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its market presence.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in the yields paid by the most fragile States," said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are put in the clouds, states will have even more trouble reducing their borrowing, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government weathers the storm
After Italy began the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
Following a meeting with the Minister of economy, the regional presidents stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements subsequently demented by the person concerned.
In any event, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy risk hedging (CRQ) contracts had soared to 263 points, causing some upheaval in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with German rates was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, became "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and stagnation of the income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a jug of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will account for 4.3% of GDP next year (up from 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (was 2.7%).
Hence the rumour that new budgetary provisions can be implemented after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," says Economics Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of his economy are in order and his accounts are in good shape, as we have long said," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at Italy's responsible International Monetary Fund at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, earlier or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are lower than those required of other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
There remains the problem of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be anticipated by the end of March.
In such a case, a period of little conducive to decision-making would be opened in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening crisis-fighting mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has already repeated this yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that we have already demonstrated on Sunday, at night and at day, that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to defending their currency and monetary zone."
Although relative, yesterday's relaxation in the types of European states' obligations has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalization.
Rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a really lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems," exane BNP Paribas economists say.
Especially since "the political pace is much slower than the pace of markets."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen existing crisis exit mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are on track.
And this is also taking into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings earlier next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its chief executive, Klaus Regling, has on Tuesday in Singapore begun a tour of Asia to inform Far Eastern investors about developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly paves the way.
The first EFSF title issues are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative entrusted the Reuters agency that the United States would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As regards the countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid applying for international aid at all costs before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider essential to increase confidence on a lasting basis.
The capitalist partners of European funds finally consider the options available to speed up the process of normalizing public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take out the portfolio again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a frontline player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently with EUR 60 billion.
A council which, no doubt, could examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sévres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments that were already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfalls affect northern Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the Island of France.
Snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected apartments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The affected departments are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Cotes d'Armor, Finistére, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Lower Normandy, Isle of France and Lemosín regions.
Snowfall is strong enough to cause circulation difficulties and affect some economic activities, Météo France warns.
In the Cotes d'Armor, heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axles, have been prohibited from accessing several departmental roads.
According to the gendarmes, circulation on Brittany's secondary network is complicated, so they recommend that it should not be driven except in case of need and certain TER vehicles have been banned during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation in Picardy has been prohibited.
No specific action had been envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the greatest prudence on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris's Roissy Airport and 10% in Orly on Thursday because of the planned snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh In Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the Island of France has reached its peak, billions have rained.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To initiate this GSP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of EUR 4 billion.
Theoretically, this sum will subsequently allow the GSP to obtain loans on the markets to finance a portion of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending finance law, discussed in the National Assembly's finance committee this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of an excise equipment tax and the increase in office tax on the Island of France.
The first, as read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year".
The second is an amendment to an office tax that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate that increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
No figures are given in the text.
But it's a long way from $4 billion.
"Tax resources are needed to be added to the EUR 4 billion allocation of funds to be mobilized by the State and granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanapher.
The GSP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4 billion later, as explained."
"It will be recorded in the budget and used according to the needs".
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised $4 billion is not on credit, can provoke a slightly lit parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be on 7 December.
Avengers hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandal at the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation that each record created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual customs only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret records should only be made up of public knowledge news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unreleased research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who engage in occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, as is lazy (or has little craving) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I know, editor of the Libération), who only considers what he can recognize true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the US embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek the previous week.
So why have the revelations in these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State can phone or catch the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into espionage centres.
Any viewer who watchs research films knows it perfectly, we just pretend we don't know it from hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad picture of American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country greatly affects the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore affects both victims and executioners.
But let's go into the true nature of what's happened.
In the past, in Orwell's day, he could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as is now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be put up with it that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact an empty secret, without secrecy, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power from her.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like posting it on a street sign.
But it is also clear that, with today's technologies, confidential conversations cannot be expected over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has traveled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my foresight is a science fiction thing and therefore novel, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in stagecoaches with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by heart or, at best, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: in the end, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph has revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with (telephone) cables.
Video (analog) tapes had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of assembly, while now (digital) CDs only allow you to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, to huge proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the journeys involved, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary for politics and communication techniques to take us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In the old world, the press was trying to understand what was secretly being plotted in embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: France's sloppy in its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly unlocked funding promises (called fast starts or early ones) made by developed countries have been respected.
And the French sloppy ones have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union undertook to contribute EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that their commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major supplementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The operation transparency proved appreciable and appreciated for what it really is worth: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track to meet its 7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without harming official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has referred to 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development aid.
In contrast, France considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries may remain stable (or even decrease), while seeking to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the calculation method.
Some, such as France, consider that every euro borrowed equals one euro donated.
Clearly, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to reducing emissions based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be counted for its commitments.
But France does not find such reasoning useful: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million); refer to the EU document to see it in your own eyes.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments to 100% donations.
In other words, when most of the European Union contributes a euro to fulfil its commitment, France contributes only ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, in its fast start funding, France does a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to stocks over time and, on the other hand, in relation to true financial effort.
Spending as little as 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The early financing chapter is relatively short-term in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could advance discussions on gambling in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of "additional character" or the method of computing loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We are therefore left with the hope of the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start-ups and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to advance the negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy one day ingests 81 different chemicals, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem addressed", acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the food usually consumed by a child of about ten years in four meals and one snack a day.
These meals taken as a model, which respect official recommendations (five parts fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as treats, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five substances classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"While virtually all cases do not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to possibly carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is of concern," the association says.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in food, where the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna and even bread bar or gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, tests discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk of these "contaminant cocktails" to the consumer is "probably underestimated," the study says.
The European Ecology-Les Verts Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "in the face of the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
