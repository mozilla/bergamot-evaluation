The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions in ČEZ shares reached about half their value on a typical day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday&#39;s decline when it fell to about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall in stocks on Wall Street.
Also here is expressed the market reaction to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Stocks fall in Asia
The shares of the Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although throughout the day the index finally mitigated part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index throughout its financial day was almost four percent, although it later mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by practically 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that tracks the movements of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange according to the Secretary of the Index fell to 3.6 percent.
&quot;The rescue actions planned in the US are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world,&quot; said the Head of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong&#39;s interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
American lawmakers should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody toilet of American stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the plan to help the financial system to which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion crowns) should be dedicated.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush&#39;s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to nearly seven percent. A similar volume drop was last recorded in 1987.
The index fell before being announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly&#39;s proposal did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress Withdraws: The US Government May Inject $ 700 Billion Into Banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact on broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
Your vote will take place early next week.
The American legislators caused a breach in the conversations on the approval of the plan of rescue in its form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet earned.
Congressmen need to fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and vote on it.
The aid plan for the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Assembly Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could take place in the Senate no earlier than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Later, however, &quot;disenchantment&quot; will be reached thanks to the complex mechanisms whose aid to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
&quot;We have made great progress.
We resolved our dissenting opinions regarding the form that the package of measures for the stabilization of the market should have &quot;commented the Democrat Nancy Pelosiá to the Bloomberg agency.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final shape to the Government Fund.
It should buy unsold mortgage assets from finance companies that lead finance companies to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
&quot;We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already working on it, &quot;said Paulson.
A sign for Asian businesses
The global financial crisis specifically affects the market for rapidly declining stocks.
According to the Democratic Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing everything possible so that the Congress finally approves an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors&#39; business in the Asian finance market since these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday&#39;s trade.
However, for now there is nothing clear for sure about when the two houses of the US Congress will vote and, not even, if they will not stagnate at the last minute with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, will undergo a series of changes.
The total amount destined to help the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it is under the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another 100 billion dollars and, later, the last 350 billion dollars. Dollars.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can overcome his veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was preserved, which consisted of gaining financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
&quot;We have worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, &quot;said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress on Saturday and that he values &quot;the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy.&quot;
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said lawmakers decided on the liability of the taxpayer&#39;s tax protection program money for their losses, a relieving closure of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called armored contracts for directors of the companies participating in the program, and creates a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
&quot;We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress toward an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,&quot; Paulson said.
The plan also includes helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to the new payments on the mortgages it buys in order to lower the monthly installment burden on borrowers and enable them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea to be carried out but quite difficult.
&quot;And this is why it is not known with what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government, &quot;Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, all that relevant.
&quot;Much more important is that, already this week the congressmen agree on their support and give their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement that this approval is reached is, at the moment, the most important thing, &quot;insisted Marek.
Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together they make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought, according to the first approximate results, an appreciable weakening of both parties of the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the party of the populist right.
Strong and special losses have suffered the Austrian People&#39;s Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaking.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphant return to national politics.
According to approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of votes, thus losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last elections of 2006. .
Worse still has ended the OVP that loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of votes.
They are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the postwar period and especially for the popular ones who called these early elections.
Still in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation was heard about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be achieved this Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party&#39;s presidency.
Such evolution would evidently facilitate the path of the constant and more approximate starting point of the electoral results, that is, of the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
Considering that the reinforcement of both parties of the populist right - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, eleven percent of the votes - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that The same thing happened in 1999 when the popular negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it dismembered from BZO) for a coalition government that came to generate a sanction from the European Union.
Haider clearly bets on this evolution, who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he is already assuming his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament although it has lost slightly and fell from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Fight at gunpoint: the MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every cell phone plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
What seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are enough reasons for the man to buy only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way of its use and on the requirements of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for you to acquire the most modern turntable to hear the latest Maxim Turbulenc album on it.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP records no longer come out, and in terms of their quality there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music are crowding on your shelves, you are probably dreaming, at least, of this type of turntable.
This is the same with music on the way, that is, compressed, simplified music - MP3 music.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try twenty crowns flea market helmets.
Two ends, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
You also decide the battery life
Some of the best players do much more than just play music and even what most phones do not.
No current device is as universal as the telephone.
Faced with the most basic functions such as telephoning, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, you have a better or worse camera and you can even navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and PDAs, they will also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator knows how to grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the mobile, the sooner the screen indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy suckers.
Few are the mobiles that can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly have a higher performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobiles will not play for more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of that, they call constantly, get each other, for more safety, a charger for work - this also applies to the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem is not going to be, because even the worst can endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem happens when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, only part of the devices have the universal USB connector and, furthermore, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly on the memory card, but only in some non-shrink reader units can the small memory cards used in mobile phones be connected.
In the players, with some exceptions (iPod), no special software is necessary.
It is enough to fill the device with music through the USB of the computer.
Most mobiles and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the artist, album title, genre or also according to the user&#39;s evaluation.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
When choosing a specific device, be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music in the background and you are going to listen to it every day for only a little while, like on the tram, then any mobile that you play is enough for you.
What practically any mobile truly achieves.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile phone or the player plays the music.
The MP3 is reproduced by all and, practically, almost all the music that reaches you will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it, the absolute majority of devices play music in WMA format.
The minuses include the AAC format (format used by the Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the relevant pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or an album.
This service alone could be a strong argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately the offer of the operators is miserable and the majority is limited only to the subjects of fleeting success of the radios.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry a cell phone.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you will find your mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry a headset or at least a handsfree with you.
If not, you can use a built-in player that almost every mobile has, even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many mobile phones with music will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already buy a good Walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone jack.
The best, even when it comes to the technical side, such as phones equipped with a 3.5mm input. for classic headphones, they cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are actually handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the internet with our mobile phone and, consequently, a gigantic account for data download.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (for example, the Vodafone 527) generally have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card it will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are normally equipped with only a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive ones have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers, take advantage of the most specialized walkman-mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman line phones have almost the same use as a standalone MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, about four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (normally 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand cited above brings you MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will already arrive this year in the Czech Republic.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer practically all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we are still missing something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It probably won&#39;t be long in coming.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written in mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulating roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to be reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them. from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, since we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to lament that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, also said that there is no longer a place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with its own network it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find a frequency).
However, there is still one possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator in the mobile telephony market brought a significant drop in prices to which the classic operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the British market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is a place for these types of operators and that they can be successful.
For the rest, you don&#39;t have to look too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 clients and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U: fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
Furthermore, in order for them to function effectively, they have far fewer clients than a traditional operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large expenses in construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are usually low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that, however, are often counteracted by the offer of more adjusted services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half as cheap as the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on a non-trivial target group can also be a good blow.
This operator specifically targets man.
&quot;The right man chooses Mobilking - he is the operator you like and who you can trust,&quot; says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if a similar concept like that of Poland could hook in our country.
Vodafone spokesperson Miroslav Čepický doubts this: &quot;The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the supply of services, it is relatively saturated &quot;
No chance in the Czech Republic, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
&quot;We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region, &quot;Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone conversation for mobil.cz.
Indirectly he assured that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather the opposite, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition for Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
&quot;We have a great interest in this, to be able to offer our clients not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly come across all Czech mobile phone operators.
With some of them we have managed to advance the meetings, &quot;said the group&#39;s spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe better times flash.
It seems that, due to unofficial information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
&quot;At the moment we believe that the situation is ideal for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
Until now no one has approached us with a complex and serious project in this field &quot;, Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesperson for Telefónica O2, told mobil.cz.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, exceptionally in accordance with O2&#39;s opinion, adds: &quot;Until today we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop.&quot;
And he adds: &quot;In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this time we should already have on the table a specific contract that could be studied in such a short horizon &quot;
Vodafone directs its attention rather to the fulfillment of the own requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: &quot;We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We consider it precisely the greatest contribution from the customer&#39;s point of view.
Vodafone&#39;s main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for fast mobile internet. &quot;
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to lower prices and thus lower profits.
So why facilitate entry to the competition?
When operators want to achieve something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U: fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U: fon by the T-Mobile partnership.
This is attested by the public information accessible on the ČTÚ web pages.
But right now U: fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: &quot;Furthermore, it was not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened up to a fourth operator.
With regard to the nature of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean great requirements for him and, above all, for his services. &quot;
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the complete disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just about the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately does not have any jurisdiction to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (ÚOHS).
However, she expressed her typical position on this problem.
&quot;The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile telephony market would be possible after the conclusion of an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator.
Until today no agreement has been closed since the offer of the potential interested parties was not interesting enough for the classic operators &quot;, added to our question Kristián Chalupa, from the Department of Foreign Relations of the ÚOHS.
These formulated statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers this is more than a consideration, apart from that they must observe that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: &quot;Abroad, where virtual operators operate normally, we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the drop in prices of mobile telephony services&quot;
Obviously, the pressure regarding the correct functioning of the market means and the lowering of prices are not within the interest of the ÚOHS.
What is really dramatically shocking in this whole case is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a fluke presents itself.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a tough fight for competition.
&quot;The Office in this regard has not found signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, therefore they do not have a corresponding increase in responsibility in their actions in the market.
Rather, the necessary tools to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators are lacking, as well as telecommunications regulators, &quot;added Chalupa to his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many sticking points.
Obviously there is an analysis of relevant markets prepared by ČTÚ according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of commercial tendering a single market.
In this type of market naturally none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another view - for a virtual operator to emerge, an agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile phone operator - with all its logic - has a monopoly on its network.
Therefore, in a specific segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument were not accepted, at least for ÚOHS it should represent a warning that three mobile operators rise strikingly in a similar way.
The current complaints from the interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with the operators they run into many similar impediments.
Placing responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in the telecommunications field of which the ÚOHS washes its hands on all this matter.
We have already met him in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was presented a short time ago to extend the competence of ČTÚ in the field of commercial tenders, which was not carried out, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well known to the representatives of ÚOHS, but it is clear that their interests lie elsewhere.
Everything is fine, when no one is looking
At the same time, something like a pseudo-virtual operator continues to operate unnoticed, since there are already quite a few in the Czech mobile phone networks.
They are companies that set their own prices for mobile phone services, which, however, only part of them are public.
Usually these are companies that are dedicated to multilevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife, and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a select few get the price list from these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same, ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions in all Czech mobile phone operators prohibit this type of resale.
&quot;If cases such as the ones you cite were discovered, one could speak of an infringement of the contract conditions that could lead to the end of collaboration with the given society,&quot; Martina Kemrová answered the question about this problem.
But it is highly unlikely that an activity of this kind carried out by mobile phone operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of clients.
None of the operators is against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they obtain a not inconsiderable profit and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of possible problems: &quot;the law allows speculation of this kind, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible percentage of clients.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card of their phone is not in their name, so they cannot absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the operators. &quot;
This is precisely what should seem minimally strange to ČTÚ.
In addition, a new question appears for the ÚOHS.
If mobile phone operators squint at this type of procedure, why are they blocking the virtual operator&#39;s entry?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want to, it should not be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not. allow.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As it was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator in the mobile telephony market brought a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, in practically all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classic operators more or less tried to protect themselves from this irruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of the service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, at this time the regulatory bodies have intervened and in none of the cases did they defend the operators but rather their clients.
Either with formal measures or informal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual operator and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body passes this whole case as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot help but be impressed that the confusion of the attributions in these cases suits them.
But let&#39;s not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator really reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market will probably start to move again.
If any of the operators allows a virtual mobile phone operator to enter, it will be difficult for ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we will perhaps stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four performances of the new version of the Czech official anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new hymn was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theater under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one with a male voice and one with a female voice, another with Chorus and another instrumental.
The singing is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn arrangements are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers this national Czech chant one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio already said before that it intentionally chose for the Solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
&quot;From the beginning I have tried with both of them and later, also, with the Choir to pay attention to the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had consonance,&quot; he commented.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home was first played in 1834 on the stage of the State Theater in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 naturally became a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the rise of the independent Czech Republic.

This can be purchased at the moment by almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (it will be valid as of January 1, 2009) and simultaneously load it onto their chip card at the infocentres and transport company posts at the stations of the Metro, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The vouchers can already be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about the ticket booths in subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard is recharged at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
&quot;In these places there is a window available to passengers with trained personnel who help those interested with the purchase online and also with the recharge of the voucher purchased on their card,&quot; said the spokesperson for the project, Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher in the Opencard in the automatic vending machines that are in some lobbies of the metro.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket machine, and travelers have probably already noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, IP Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
&quot;Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty,&quot; Opatrný added.
The voucher is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid voucher will be charged only to it.
The electronic vouchers from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, on the ring-road trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that are mainly used by the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
&quot;In the trains assigned to the integrated transport of Prague there are inspectors equipped with a reader card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the voucher&quot;, as explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the public transport of Prague.
Bypass buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver&#39;s locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany him with the Opencard in the place designated for it on the side of the Cashier.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the voucher.
&quot;If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the vouchers, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information,&quot; Drápal completed.
Passengers who do not travel on the bypass buses and do not remember when the validity of the voucher expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the screen of the machine, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the US in a referendum
Sudeten Germans asked in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans presumably approached the US president in 1945.
It results from the letters that are kept in a private archive and that today are kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the &quot;Šumava land&quot; - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
&quot;We have understood the situation correctly and we really want your word that the American units are arriving in German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators&quot; is written in the letter, signed with &quot;the people who carry the destiny of Šumava in your heart&quot;.
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the Southeast Germans presumably supposes - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, inconsideration, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter to the American president to assume for today and forever to Šumava under a protectorate.
&quot;We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants it will hand us over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way collaborates with the victory of the allies,&quot; the letter wrote.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably fear of reprisals from the &quot;Czech oppressors&quot;.
If the president of the USA presumably doubted this idea of the German šumavos, it would suffice to organize a referendum in the šumava lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under its patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of post-war history, may sound a bit childish to us, according to some specialists it rightly paints the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast of that time.
Although the Czech Germans must have had a slight intuition that their expulsion from the republic was going to be discussed, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate for the Sudetenland some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed that they will stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is even confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was in the war, as a German from Budějovice, enlisted in the Baltic navy.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and placed him in the Holstein prison camp, dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
&quot;They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would be good for them,&quot; said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, expected that on the basis of the Benes Decrees they would be removed from the Republic.
You don&#39;t think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way, the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch in the media on Wednesday could be characterized.
Minister Aleš Řebíček&#39;s office promises to deter drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The $ 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, film, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to dissuade the driver from high speed and alcohol behind the wheel.
And also to remind you to fasten your seatbelts before setting off.
It wants to reach the awareness above all of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and lastly also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that attack the emotions.
And for this the &quot;bloodthirsty&quot; ads throughout the campaign testify to us:
You don&#39;t think - you pay!
The word &quot;You don&#39;t think&quot; is written in large letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word &quot;pay.&quot;
This should symbolize that the man in a moment of neglect can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will &quot;scare&quot; viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be observed.
It promises that in this way it will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
&quot;For drivers the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he runs a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is the threat of a fine or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risks, &quot;says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Kořán.
And that is why an information campaign in the press and mainly negative publicity is necessary, the psychologist specifies.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
&quot;If there is a panel installed warning of any danger, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay much attention to it,&quot; warned Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, ruled on the restitution of practically all the lands occupied in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that he appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on Monday.
&quot;We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) lands, if not all,&quot; Olmert told the newspaper.
&quot;Surely we will keep a few percent of these lands, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percent (of Israel&#39;s lands) because without this there will be no peace,&quot; he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution East Jerusalem would also be included.
&quot;He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem,&quot; Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find &quot;a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historical place&quot; that is located inside the ancient city.
&quot;Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work, &quot;he insisted later.
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel&#39;s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which from his point of view is an inherent condition for closing a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
&quot;I am not proposing to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan,&quot; he warned.
&quot;The Syrians know well what they will have to part with to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hezbollah (the Cheetah movement), they will have to shed the permanent support that terrorism provokes from Hamas (the Cheetah movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq &quot;, specified the prime minister.
Schwarzenberg: relations with India may cool down
Failure to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles could lead to a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was stated by the minister in New York, after today&#39;s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
&quot;If this is not solved, then yes, then this cooling would certainly be achieved,&quot; he confirmed after the meeting that was organized on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that it is difficult for the executive to interfere in legal matters.
However, it stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, which was exempted from prosecution and punished with a fine, the government can negotiate with the local Darjiling government in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
&quot;Your problem could be solved,&quot; said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best thing for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to the highest authorities.
Then you can request the exoneration of the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
&quot;He advises to appeal to the High Court and then pardon would be possible,&quot; said the Head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is by getting the condemned person &quot;competent legal support,&quot; the Indian minister said.
On the other hand, he said that such support is already being obtained by the Indian side.
&quot;We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians recognize it as well, &quot;commented Schwarzenberg.
On the other hand, as ČTK said, before his colleague he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
&quot;We really consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and convict these Czech scientists,&quot; he announced.
The minister avoided answering the question whether he received a promise from the Indian side that he would take up the matter.
&quot;I have received quite a few promises,&quot; he only stated.
Questions after the accident: Are hostesses illegal on buses?
The law is unknown, you can&#39;t walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident involving the Student Agency bus near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises as to whether the hostesses and passengers can move around the bus during the trip.
&quot;If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the stewardess is contrary to the road traffic law,&quot; says the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old flight attendant died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver, except that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place in the vehicle despite having two other places reserved.
However, the bus can have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the precise moment when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
What plays a role here is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permit, with walking places.
If the bus is not homologated, the passenger must be seated.
Student Agency long-distance buses have no standing places, company director Radim Jančura confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
&quot;We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was withdrawn and we reached an agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat, &quot;he told us his position.
The stewardess does not know the law
&quot;There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the stewardess - no legal provision clarifies this role.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transport law only knows the term Vehicle Inspector, whose rights and obligations are not defined &quot;, adds, less emphatically, the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks on the contrary that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
&quot;It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have walking sites.
That&#39;s it, &quot;he says.
The buses are divided into urban, where there are places to stand and with a limited maximum speed, intercity with places to stand with a higher speed permit, and long-distance buses without places to go standing, with the highest permit. speed and with seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says the expert
BESIP Transport Safety Expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see major problems regarding the movement of the steward on the bus.
&quot;During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service in airplanes.
Even here there is no guarantee that the turbulence will come and that the stewardess will hit her head. &quot;
&quot;However, if the bus stops suddenly the physical laws are obviously valid.
The same as on a city bus or on the tram.
The security of the stewardess must be solved by the internal regulations of the carrier, &quot;he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jančura is prepared to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the hostess service.
He employs two hundred on it.
The director, not even after the accident, considers that job risky.
&quot;However, the moment I get the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I will abolish it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers as they enter.
It would even save expenses, &quot;he says.
In the interests of safety is the reason that Asiana lacks hostesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
&quot;We do not have hostesses, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident, &quot;he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
An enormous tragedy happened
In the accident on the line that connects Naples, a young hostess from Pilsen died, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably veered from the parking lane blocking the bus. without using the turn signals.
Its driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the front right.
Jančura denies that the two places that are reserved for the hostess&#39;s rest were sold.
&quot;These sites cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked.&quot;
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency is not going to wait for the verdict of the judgment on the compensation of the girl&#39;s family but expects the financial expenses also from the guilty party.
Law reform?
Not for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the movement of the flight attendant on the bus in which thirty experts, members of a group from the Ministry of Transport, have been working for a year.
&quot;However, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They do not focus too much on buses, but rather on the point system, maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while on the move, &quot;says expert Hořín.
&quot;The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the hostesses something that significantly threatens the safety of passengers&quot;, ending the spokesman Hanzelka, that the control of security in buses is the responsibility of the police and the Security Office at work.
A Czech referees a fight on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, it represents Australia surrounded by the sea.
However, he is not interested in the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
&quot;The island belongs to Australia and with it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is, at the same time, as big as a single continent, &quot;says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law Affairs.
His boss, Director of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and sometimes completes it.
It governs this mood and enthusiasm for work.
Until today, the seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms until today that in themselves hold the key to the development of anticancer drugs.
The bottom is greater than the mainland
The countries with coasts have today begun to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights that were agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is fundamentally the so-called continental border which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
It has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental Rim.
&quot;Simply, by continental border we mean the part of the seabed and its surface, which is a natural continuation of the underwater continent.
It reaches the limit of the coast of the sea, and often, up to the border of the two hundred nautical miles, that is to say, pure economic zone &quot;, explains Mikulka.
The petition that the given country presents to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer limits of the Continent Border, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measurements.
It is the result of a series of years of preparation of works.
&quot;One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist help commission.
The commission has so far processed five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come out ahead, &quot;adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia&#39;s success had a global impact as it was the first to essentially expand its marine dominance.
But so did New Zealand - the seafloor area awarded by the commission last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, or nearly six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for its study.
The profit that will come from the use of the seabed will be, as they promise, invaluable.
Other states are also slowly filing their applications.
They can do so for up to ten years from the moment they ratified the &quot;Treaty of Montego Bay&quot;.
Wherever the continental Rim ends, the region of the ocean floor, declared by Treaty as the &quot;common heritage of mankind&quot; begins.
Already here, no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by the Treaties established by international institutions.
&quot;The seabed, however, is not a gold mine,&quot; says director Mikulka emphatically, adding &quot;that its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract.&quot;
Czechs in the Pacific
And today, a part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization &quot;Interoceanmetal&quot;.
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors the same as a few other states, states called &quot;the pioneer investor.&quot;
It has the power to mine in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom there is rugged, it is something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
&quot;An area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concretion deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, &quot;adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
Hope for Dusseldorf rests on Frankfurt
In the letter from the board of directors of the West LB bank to its collaborators, there is no shortage of great words.
By the merger of the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA can form &#39;a central market of capitals of the financial group of Sparkassen&#39;, as it says the writing, published on Monday
West LB bank, breaking the &#39;bloc of competition&#39; with sustainable profit capacity would enter such a business.
Furthermore, such a merger can be a start for subsequent mergers at the regional bank level.
This is how he comes to understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in tough times.
Because just as before, West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the European Union side, but also from the federal institute for financial services surveillance which has recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the Frankfurt side, there has been a lot of talk about such a merger between DEKA bank, which Sparkasse clients know from their investment funds, and West LB.
To tell the truth, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, let it be known that he does not see any sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as for example the Helaba or the West LB.
But DEKA&#39;s board of directors, which is now made up of Sparkassen&#39;s regional banks and associations, tasked the board of directors with starting negotiations with the West LB on common business activities.
This could be a capital market business or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just started, so they say on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the field of Sparkassen, the name of the DEKA bank appears, which with its 3,000 collaborators is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Frankfurt financial site.
At one point in 2003 the situation looked like this that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hessian government spoke out against Helaba&#39;s participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate started the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks was always being played anew.
But finally Günther Merl, the president of the Helaba board of directors, expressed that he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Regardless of that, it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliament elections are going to happen, the union of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure to continue merging increases, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank might just be a young partner, although so far it has stood out much better from the financial crisis than the Stuttgart and Munich properties did.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided plans to coexist with West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections are only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end the West LB can be broken, but that, of course, is not the bank&#39;s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter from the bank&#39;s board of directors it is stated that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank
As the coexistence between singular parts of the bank can be reconciled with the DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as &quot;the weekend of the Italians&quot;
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca it is already the third or fourth.
But this time, he is assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that is why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5-liter barrel of Kaiser beer is a huge tiger bear that shows almost 200 Oktoberfest participants what low sounds it knows how to produce in its throat.
Elena gives Luca a pat first, then a kiss.
From Bologna they reached Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 11:45 p.m. three buses leave, &#39;heading to Munich, the beer festival&#39;, expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag the South Americans are singing, they had already started to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with a faux fur lining and glasses with silver temples, owns these buses.
They have been coming to Oktoberfest for five years, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 10:30 p.m. on the way back.
Staying overnight there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome reception with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and the guide in German - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction &quot;Brennero&quot;
No beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns in the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
Okay so, they will still need the strength.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration make another break on the highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco&#39;s group is scheduled to arrive at 6.30 in the morning in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already around 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First: put on a yellow cap.
There, on the left side is written &quot;Oktoberfest&quot;, next to it in gothic script is the page of Marco&#39;s travel office on the internet: &quot;conoscersiviaggiando.it&quot;.
Second: &quot;When the doors of the tent are opened, that means march!&quot;, Marco shouts at dawn.
&quot;To March!&quot; March and occupy the back seats in the tent.
&quot;Do not take the places in front, because we are going to block, and all with yellow caps do not sit on the same bench, spread out all over the space!&quot;
A liter of beer, Marco roars, costs 8.25 euros.
Don&#39;t forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he leaves his place, he will already be occupied! &quot;
Third: &quot;This afternoon at exactly ten thirty you have to get here!&quot; Do you understand?
And now everyone is going to Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps on trees, road signs and even on a poster of the elections of a large Bavarian People&#39;s Party.
You want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest which is known as &quot;the weekend of the Italians&quot;
There are no exact data on the number of people; It is about 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormy enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven policemen from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistances, ahead of the English ( about 60 assists) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite tent of the Italians is thus called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany&#39;s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück stressed just last week.
Good that the politician used the word &quot;relatively&quot; and added that the German banking environment will also be affected by the critical trends.
And that has happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the real estate financier from Munich, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a loan of one billion from a consortium of German banks to be able to withstand the turbulence in the market.
On Monday a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros.
The part of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to yield interest.
The money comes from private banks also from public law banks.
The cause of this is the losses of the subsidiary Depfa.
According to a report, the state financiers with the money that was loaned for the long-term projects financed them for only a short period - which now, due to distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank&#39;s capital reserve in cash has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of own capital lagged a little from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared with the same period last year, continued income from financial investments and net profit from financial operations fell to zero, income from the allocation for debtors and some securities, as well as from the dissolution of provisions of the credit businesses, tended to the drop of more than 70 percent, at 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and many income from the reimbursements of the compensation expenses of the restructuring of the ex-group Depfa as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal tax code and the organized businesses for the companies of the consortium, the negative balance could show a deficit with approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financier at first got lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as the reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As there was not much money to be made from financing state projects, Defa began to dedicate itself intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public- Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an &quot;essential material effect&quot; on the consolidated profit and loss account of the group, it is said very imprecisely.
It is a fact that they have canceled the dividends.
By 2007 they were canceled by two thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate became an important state financier and financier in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not have customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans fell essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a part of the Defa credit portfolios of its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a loan the need for group financing for a short time and the company is assured of &quot;the influence of international money markets that are now essentially not able to function&quot;
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the Chairman of the Hypo Real Estate Board of Directors, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the federal institute for the supervision of financial services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now assured.
That is what shareholders and creditors of the bank have to wait for.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even conceivable that financing should not be required in full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be excluded.
Word spread that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, that is why temporary salvation cannot at least reassure people who are concerned.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While the priority debts hardly changed, the course of the loans according to the position in the land registry clearly tended to decline.
Affected are above all the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and rightly the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the notable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans, which were previously an investment for speculation, must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it is possible to start with the amortization of pensions on time.
Or something is going to happen, which no one dares imagine - the financial crisis will overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the news spread about partial nationalization, now the security that is already at its limit became a justified hope.
That&#39;s going to be one reason, because creditors will spend sleepless nights, breaking their heads over the decision on their isolation from enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put an end to it and use the carry forward of losses for future exchange profit indemnity tax payments in the future.
During the liberation of the hostages the German special forces command was on the scene of action
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany - experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue action.
Therefore at the place of liberation were the specialists from the German army as well as officials from GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Force Squadron, from the Federal Criminal Investigation Office as well as the logistics experts from the technical charity. .
As ministry spokesmen reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The government of Egypt accepted the help of Germany to use it as support in the place.
&quot;Fortunately, that moment did not come,&quot; said a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry.
On September 19 in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers made up of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions.
After the kidnapping in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile the saved people safely arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He did not say a word about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper &quot;Bild&quot;, 5 tourists and special forces have to return by Airbus of the German air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent? -Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to appear at the Tachibana Highschool on the first day, the girls started laughing: The German is totally &quot;kawaii&quot;!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
&quot;The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before going to school I was afraid.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to Highschool Tachibana.
I just had to find my way, luckily I didn&#39;t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not fixed as rigorously as at my home in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at twenty to nine a small meeting begins with the teachers, the &#39;home room&#39;.
Before class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
Also, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially before a class of 40 students.
Since they still have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt from the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, dressed like this, I went to the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything in the correct way: &quot;Sayonara Wo she Sylvana ...&quot; - my name is Sylvana, I&#39;m from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this time I was very happy because two years ago I had started to study this language.
All 31 girls in the class have whispered, laughed and beckoned and I have heard the word &quot;kawaii&quot; all the time.
I already knew her from my Mangas.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means &quot;cute, pretty&quot;
Then I quickly slid into my site.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I really felt assaulted.
Everyone was talking at the same time, laughing and asking a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Later at recess everyone took out their Bentos.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it&#39;s something other than boring German pieces of bread.
It had herbed rice, little sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit, and something like tofu dumplings.
In most cases I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Things are weird and taste new.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bentos are not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a bento made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in hopes of getting to know him better during recess.
I read about that in my Manga-Comics.
I&#39;m very curious to see if I can see it here too.
&quot;Why precisely Japan?&quot; My friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
&quot;Well, because it fascinates me.&quot;
Finally for years I prefer to read Mangas.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a skinny by tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
Since everything is well organized, I still haven&#39;t felt lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. &quot;
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the salvation package
The first chamber of the United States Congress barely let a great rescue package of 700 billion dollars for the financial markets fail.
The Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The United States House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes to 206 the government&#39;s package to save the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties, he did not reach a majority for the program with which the disorder in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action the desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the large $ 700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to vote, although the plan is not as popular.
&quot;It is difficult to receive political approval to avoid something that absolutely has not happened yet,&quot; he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investor concerns that the state salvation package could fail.
It rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, it fell again.
Experts expect other serious turmoil in international financial markets.
To put the program into effect, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Rats have feelings too
It is said that a rat or a cockroach, sensing the danger, flees, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can you control if they, behaving in the same way as us, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called &quot;Edge&quot; for many years the contributions of famous scientists have been published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness that I or someone else could not prove until now, although we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope for it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include the questions about sensation and consciousness in general, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as other animals: it plays dead, runs away, or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Naturally I don&#39;t think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transmit our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated by human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their participation in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to suppose that even man differs from other primates .
One other peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked to language, this often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it in such a way that the consciousness of animals, however created, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, cannot be measured because it has the special hardware, nor can it be analyzed through our experiences, then his research presents us with big problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific investigations.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without taking their contents into account, and that is what happens during short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essential thing passes rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be similar.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what results from that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that a part of the brain that is responsible for this is activated in the emotional system, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space in the defense system (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body).
Seen from this point of view the sensations are very fixed to part of the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of the linguistic nature, they follow fine classifications of sensations because we can differentiate and classify the states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others as well as ourselves.
For example Antonio Damasco, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brain stem, the same Jaak Pankseep thinks, but he concentrates more on the trunk brain.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer to absolutely different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control whether rats and men behaving alike feel the same way?
Seeing the danger, a cockroach runs away, why is it afraid?
I am of the opinion that similarity of behavior does not yet prove similarity of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brainstem, cockroaches on the other hand do not have at least one brain.
Is it the brain stem that is responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly cockroaches too (who knows?), Have sensations.
But I don&#39;t know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and the tongue).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured in rats and in men.
Since I do not investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It can be said that I cannot see beyond my nose, but I would rather advance than work permanently without results.
Well, I&#39;m a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister said that preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
&quot;The government looks at UEFA&#39;s decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine&#39;s ability to organize the European championship together with Poland,&quot; Wasjunik said.
&quot;But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is a lot to do. &quot;
The construction and reconstruction schedule of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums is going to be reduced from eight to six.
&quot;We can not lose more time.
Now we have to carry out work with great speed, &quot;said the president of a Ukraine association Grigorij Surkis.
&quot;UEFA will not take its eyes off us.&quot;
In Poland a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is &quot;a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,&quot; Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
&quot;In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that.&quot;
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of manipulation in descent to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
The organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to a study, the sales volume of travel reservations for the next few months increased compared to last year - including the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the weakened situation, the desire to travel of the Germans remains as before.
As reported on Monday by the German travel association (DVR) in Berlin, with travel reservations for the winter season travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year. .
According to research by the market research institute GfK, the bookings for the fall months had already risen in number.
Thus the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent more compared to 2007, reported the DVR.
The basis of the results are GfK figures, which are the information analyzed about the reservations in 1200 travel agencies and computed approximately for the entire market.
The data collected is the travel reservations made up to the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak course of the dollar, especially trips to the United States are in great demand, the DRV reported.
In this case the number of reservations increased by almost a third.
The preferred destination points of the Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Organized tours are especially popular, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of DRV.
In view of the fact that the prices of energy and food increase, in this case the travel expenses are &quot;better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip&quot;.
Among other things, consumers can save money with early bird discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months, trips were well booked, so that the volume of sales rose again compared to last year - although according to another study the number of Germans who made a trip, compared to last year, decreased.
Dennis Quaid&#39;s counterattack outraged
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in an interview about private life - and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and fights back.
The belated war of the two roses in the ex-partner of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce the two Hollywood actors publicly show a nasty fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the failure of marriage: &quot;Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful.&quot;
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan&#39;s work with the press for his new film &quot;The Women&quot; - a story of the failure of a marriage is told.
Dennis Quaid&#39;s reaction to designating him as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is &quot;unheard of for Meg how many times she tells the stories of our relationship in another version,&quot; the 54-year-old told &quot;New York Daily News.&quot; .
Among other things, it is very &quot;regrettable&quot; that Jack, her 16-year-old son, is again &quot;going to remember in public the pain and the changes, all that a divorce means for a child.&quot;
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently father of twins.
And so he ends with his statements by highlighting: &quot;Whatever my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that is doing well. &quot;
Airline and hotel ticket prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany became cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and hotel overnight stays became cheap again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company has analyzed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a big change in the second half.
After prices in the hotel market continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June, prices already fell to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
The trends were most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weak dollar course, which was the cause of &quot;the interest of American tourists in traveling decreased.&quot;
The decrease in hotel prices is also noticeable much more in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus set a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to the increase in kerosene prices, Economy class travelers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive to 29.2 percent .
From April to June, the prices of airline tickets in Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February, prices increased to 11.9, in the second semester they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to a study, prices for domestic flights in Germany were even cut in half.
The cause of the price change is on the one hand the growth of the sluggish economy, explains the company.
In many parts of the market for air travel, demand is declining.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit distance flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV win against Gladbach 1: 0
With a goal and simple methods SV Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia still does not come out to score the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the hard landing of the national team player Marko Martin very well.
Gladbach&#39;s player started playing late and failed by scoring a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what had happened, could be read clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
&quot;We need a second goal,&quot; whistled Hermann Rieger from the cockpit entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was for almost three decades a physiotherapist at HSV, he enjoys a very high reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded and raised his fingers in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the head coach of Hamburg.
Their order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
&quot;Today was not all pleasant to see,&quot; Marcell Jansen added later.
Bastian Reinhard, too, had wished he had it &quot;more relaxed.&quot;
The result 1: 0 (1: 0) Hamburg have Mladen Petric (11) to thank with his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all their strength to the weak Hamburg team.
&quot;That was a dirty win,&quot; Martin Jol summed up.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg will turn 121 years old.
On Saturday of will the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It&#39;s going to be a birthday without a real party.
&quot;We know how to play it,&quot; said Marcell Jansen.
He expects the partial scores in the table to correspond more to the fickleness of the league than to the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late-bound players like Brazilians Neves and Silva, striker Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the team cannot shine with their successes.
&quot;We need more of the feeling and the dribbling,&quot; Jol demands.
My first Oktoberfest
Party hits under the open sky at the Endless Spa, beer in liter jugs and famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer costumes.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don&#39;t have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on TV, and wears a tailored traditional Bavarian outfit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there is one thing that unites us: we are barely in the tent, the photographers have already rushed towards us and filled their memory cards with the photos - it is very flattering especially since I am first time at Oktoberfest.
This is how you make friends.
Cheap traditional Bavarian costumes seem to do the job.
Actually as a tourist at Oktoberfest from northern Germany my feeling of well-being in traditional Bavarian costume to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at the Prado de Teresa, everything is not so bad.
Almost everyone wears the traditional Bavarian costume or leather pants; Neither seems to be listening or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets weird looks next to a stand of bananas in the chocolate.
A woman from Munich draws my attention to my apron, which was dressed in the wrong way: &quot;the left part is single, the middle is the virgin, the right part is engaged, behind it is a widow.&quot;
Or God, now I buckle up from behind to the left.
&quot;Okay,&quot; he says laughing.
The others don&#39;t bother with many of the subtle flirting methods and wear caps with &quot;To drink to get dressed!&quot; and show, without asking, their ass knot.
A young boy who behaves in an exhibitionist way is named Bob, he is from England and he is also at Oktoberfest for the first time.
He looks like &quot;gorgeous&quot;, which he pronounces with a very long &quot;o&quot;.
He tells me after he has put down his one-liter glass of beer that he just drank.
Put it directly next to the fire hydrant, most think that&#39;s a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume as much alcohol.
Around eight o&#39;clock at night the groups of toilets run through the party place and have to worry about poor drunks.
The toilets appear each time in groups - suddenly there are always four people carrying the covered litters from one tent to the other.
That works like most visitors: They come in sober, they come back drunk.
You cannot see who suffers from the alcohol levels and is in the litter.
&quot;They are the ones who&quot; can&#39;t take it anymore, &quot;a health worker gave me the answer to my question and disappeared in a tumult.
After the voting defeat
Fear is spreading on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank&#39;s rescue package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest point loss in a day in its history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a bit.
Around 20:30, one of the most important stock market barometers in the world traded a deficit of 5 percent at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent to 1,548 points.
At this time the biggest losers on the Dow Jones were American Express which lost almost 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Shares of the Goldmann Sachs bank were down nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a large investor Warren Buffet had been financially involved in the company.
The plan of salvation foresees making resources available to buy so-called &quot;rotten&quot; mortgage shares.
But the sum will be paid at once if not step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive the receipts for the option of shares for the financial associations that during the course of the course can be collected to reduce the financial burden of the state&#39;s box.
Stock courses in Europe and the US continue to decline
The billion dollar aid for banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate falls and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the salvation of the financial market projected by the state, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculated shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the German index (Dax) to fall into a large deficit.
Despite the saving actions on the part of the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier&#39;s stock for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax fell clearly below the psychological limit of 6,000 points and traded a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
Financial markets around the world suffered a decline.
The opening of the day of Wall Street in New York began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government&#39;s $ 700 billion rescue package will not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the open, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the salvation project, the vote in the Senate may be the first of October.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan&#39;s leading Nikkei index after earnings fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell to 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the announcement of the capital increase, Arcandor&#39;s shares lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that the shares in the Thoms Cook company will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
Researchers have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon for many years: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein&#39;s Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The &quot;Ulysses&quot; space probe spent almost 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel lines are freezing now, death in the cold threatens.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, has caused confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Sun probe Ulysses.
But what has surprised researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather they frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have a higher or lower speed.
Physicists couldn&#39;t explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assist to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein&#39;s General Theory of Relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers were left in the universe.
&quot;The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth,&quot; he writes.
Researchers of the universe have known about the existence of Dark Matter for only ten years.
Supposedly she possesses the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially also any visible light.
According to scientists&#39; calculations, Dark Matter makes up at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
As Italy&#39;s foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The hijackers in the Sudan had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers are to be killed in a shootout during liberation.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations regarding the bailout have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the hijackers&#39; point of attention.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
Apparently the European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are freed.
On this the same information is presented by the Egyptian state television, the Arab television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news of the release on the Italian station Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian minister of foreign affairs, confirmed the release: &quot;Our fellow citizens and other hostages are freed.
&quot;Now we monitor his health,&quot; said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well and are in safety, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on the way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
&quot;The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue, &quot;said the guard.
It was only about &quot;receiving the hostages&quot; when suddenly &quot;this surprise&quot; came.
On Sunday Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them arrested in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom from Germany in the amount of six million euros; the money had to be delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily &quot;El Masri El Jom&quot;, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Accident victim identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian who died in hospital after being struck by a vehicle in Essex County has been identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in the city of Brentwood, was implicated in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen&#39;s Hospital in Romford, but later died.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Stepfather abuse &quot;led to suicide&quot;
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote on a confession paper: &quot;I feel responsible for his death.&quot;
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the time the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and blindfold her before performing sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms Randle, who spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court what some of Ms. Rande&#39;s friends had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed &quot;emotionally dead&quot;, as if she had &quot;given up on life. &quot;
In April 2007 her real father, Terrace Randle, found the woman dead in his Plymouth apartment.
Ms Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating using a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter&#39;s stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concludes by saying, &quot;I used to tie her up and blindfold her.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death. &quot;
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: &quot;You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a frightening experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer is that if she hadn&#39;t, the matter probably wouldn&#39;t have ended up in court. &quot;
She added: &quot;I have noticed the effect that, according to the description made by Stephanie&#39;s father and mother, the abuse had on their daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future. &quot;
An officer charged for data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June is going to be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a Ministry of Defense business trip, left two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is surely the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC Defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
&quot;They thought it was an internal matter between the Defense Ministry and the Cabinet,&quot; he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is charged under section 8.1 of the Law, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service indicated that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately transferred from his home to a secret location.
Building societies face the price of B&amp;B
In Britain construction companies could face a price tag of over £ 80,000 after the Bradford and Bingley bank bailout / bailout.
The Government, in effect, provided 14 trillion pounds sterling to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million savers of the bank.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all the companies that use the savers&#39; money, including the 59 construction companies.
The general director of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers &quot;humiliating&quot; that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $ 14 trillion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that accrues in the meantime is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Indemnity Scheme confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved wisely ... are called upon to pay today the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
In other words, each one of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and that the mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the loan will amount to 450 thousand pounds sterling in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover 81 thousand pounds sterling to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Trade Association of Building Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
&quot;It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the housing market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were much less prudent.&quot;
According to the BSA, there is no data to indicate the failure of any society since 1945.
&quot;We will need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members against what could be a relevant price,&quot; added Mr. Cole.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March 1.
In 2010, it will be a full year of interest due, which may be almost twice as much.
As construction societies are mutual organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, be it through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
Turkey broadens its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey was inked to be a member of the European Union, the European powers nested the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 paces into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least, this is what the guides say.
The building is set to pierce the end of the platforms and has two towers in front, one for each corner, all resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in your complex is a bit run-down.
But once the vault box office was passed, there is no doubt about the greatness of the company that this was the westernmost door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation consortium.
Germany, a &quot;latecomer&quot; in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that ran to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond into what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during the First World War.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell under
British rule and when forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for the Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that it was sabotage.
Since then the station has been declining and remained on the margins of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centers, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey&#39;s willingness to broaden its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a new collaboration policy.
The Turkish Government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I got on a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the AKP leaders, an expert on foreign policy, Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a bumpy ride, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - new city, intended to rule a new state. secular, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
that has raised some suspicions in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and &quot;power patisseries&quot; where middle-class managers in suits business people - men and women - meet first thing in the morning to agree / do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I&#39;m sure he still has a Blackberry.
&quot;The party&#39;s foreign policy goal is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighborhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly, &quot;he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look at the same time to the East and the West.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
It has to do both.
&quot;But surely at some point,&quot; I ask, &quot;Turkey might be forced to choose?&quot;
&quot;Turkey,&quot; he replies, &quot;does not want to face that choice.&quot;
He then underlines a point that almost everyone with whom I have spoken up to that point had recited to me almost from memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, they represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts go back to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had assisted in the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How much would they have been surprised to learn that Europe&#39;s ambitions in the Middle East, to a large extent, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting at the terminal for the ferry that will take me back across the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered &quot;the sick man of Europe.&quot;
So, there are not many doubts as to which continent this fascinating country should claim.
The price of milk rises five pence per liter
The inhabitants of the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence a liter from next Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following investigations by a consulting firm.
Merchants can decide for themselves whether they want to apply the price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the request for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she may be thrown in jail when she returns to her country.
His defenders said the court did not grant him bail, accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($ 729,700) from a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several accusations of corruption against him.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina&#39;s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country&#39;s militarily supported government grant him full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatments, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the Superior Court order.
&quot;The Supreme Court rejected the request for bail for Sheikh Hasina arguing that he could not get bail because he was already in treatment abroad on probation,&quot; said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
&quot;We are going to file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court.&quot;
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return home from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his homeland after October 17, according to what an Awami League leader said last Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed interim government took power, but was released in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges against which they are accused.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan - says the UN - have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-polio vaccination campaign due to the violence of the Taliban.
Last week the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have targeted or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision that forced the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Court that it will have to reduce its 17.9% stake in ITV to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB&#39;s interests impede competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its package of shares in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB&#39;s acquisition of the ITV stake raised doubts about ITV&#39;s independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Everyone, including Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the force to reduce its ITV package was unreasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, said BSkyB, it would have given up its voting rights.
New investigation into the inauguration of American lawyers
The United States Attorney General has appointed a special attorney to investigate the firing of nine American attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the inspector general of the Department of Justice criticized the performance by the administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
&quot;Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved,&quot; Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine American attorneys were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the attorneys had been fired for poor performance.
But later it emerged that the lawyers had not been evaluated worse than their colleagues, and many observers led to the conclusion that the firings would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the attorneys in question had worked to prosecute high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
These attorneys investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and they can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the layoffs, resigned from his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General&#39;s report is highly critical of Mr. Gonzales&#39; role in the matter, underscoring how he had &quot;primary responsibility&quot; for the firings, that he &quot;abdicated&quot; from his leadership position and was &quot;notably non-collaborative&quot; in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush aide, were criticized for failing to cooperate with the investigation.
Meat Loaf&#39;s epic of great honor
Rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will collect the special award next week at a ceremony in London, said obtaining this recognition will be &quot;an honor.&quot;
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are leading the nominations for this year&#39;s awards and ranking the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: &quot;There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.&quot;
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hymn.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and peaked at number 15 on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf&#39;s Bat Out Of Hell stayed in the charts for about nine years and went on to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003 after collapsing during a concert.
In 2007, an acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets, and other roads, some famous, others simply serving.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to pinpoint the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The little street is in the East Village and runs north of First Street - before I found Second Street - between the Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little alley, roughly 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley over an active thoroughfare.
There are no signs.
It is practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
wanting to resurface Extra Place and create a clean aisle to the stores and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who commented that they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block&#39;s past before the seizure of the buildings.
However, the city&#39;s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the Vencity Community Committee meeting for land use this month, representatives from the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring that the street remain to the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager for Community # 3, said.
&quot;The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place,&quot; said Ms.
&quot;We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street.&quot;
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as a cafe, while waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first came up during this month&#39;s meeting
But Michele de Milly, an Avalon Bay spokeswoman, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn&#39;t necessarily want to own it.
&quot;Avalon Bay&#39;s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of converting it into a public area,&quot; he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the agency&#39;s mission is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has made a mark in history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when the large estate owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his sons and this narrow strip of land was unclaimed by anyone.
The back door to the CBGB, the punk rock landmark that closed in 2006, opened at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that appears on the cover of the Ramones album &quot;Rocket to Russia.&quot;
&quot;The setting was magnificent,&quot; said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
&quot;It was full of garbage, pieces of clothing and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes.&quot;
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a slit of the city that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah&#39;s Vanishing New York (subtitle, &quot;The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct&quot;), has made available part of a talk on the history of the city on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: &quot;Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead-end alley, dark also by day and punctuated by rusty iron warehouse doors and window shutters, with weeks old newspapers blown along the gutters. &quot;
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat healed across the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz beer bottle stood near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that it could be given a clean.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
&quot;I spent the best years of my life,&quot; he said, &quot;in dark, humid and disgusting places.&quot;
The Debate on Bilingualism: Immersion in the English Language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates&#39; positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a longtime associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book &quot;Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice.&quot;
Effectively reaching Hispanic voters is tough business.
The educational proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of this.
Mr. Obama&#39;s campaign notes that &quot;African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,&quot; and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama&#39;s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, &quot;transitional bilingual education&quot; for English-learners.
However, the open question for Mr Obama is whether the commitment to bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, will be effective in nullifying the gap in the bottom line.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
At this school, the vast majority of students are Hispanics and from low-income families:
more than a third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
Yet an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have scored positively on the 2008 math test.
and an almost equally astonishing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved by using a different ingredient than that favored by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies, and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, Sixth Street Principal, the school&#39;s focus for English instruction to students is on &quot;total immersion.&quot;
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, &quot;We have had extraordinary successes with students like this last one who has come from Mexico and that if you walk into the classroom 12 months later you would not be able to pick up what was . &quot;
&quot;It works,&quot; he noted, &quot;we think it works.&quot;
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to be replicated by other schools with large Hispanic-English student populations?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of the politicians of his party on the issue of education (the Associations for National Education have long been advocates of bilingual education) and himself Constant support for bilingual education obscure the prediction of Mr Obama&#39;s response.
While immigrants must learn English, recently Mr Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English
Instead, he said, &quot;You have to make sure your child can speak Spanish.&quot;
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider the education models that work well, rather than disparage or trivialize them.
The price of oil falls sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil fell dramatically on Monday due to concerns that the US bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil shares fell 7 percent to $ 99.80 a barrel in morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped more than $ 20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $ 145.29 a barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $ 90 a barrel earlier this month, before retreating once again on the back of huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders who said they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the latest episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to what the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, on the hectic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal &quot;appear not to have been able to reactivate market sentiment.&quot;
As the economic situation deteriorates, a decline in demand for basic products, including oil, is expected.
&quot;The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates is going to become increasingly uncertain,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
&quot;We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is assessing whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. &quot;
The bank&#39;s analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption drops due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast for oil and gas price reduction is 20 percent for 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team sets record
After spending more time in the Jets uniform than anyone in the Jets uniform for the past eight seasons playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought I had seen it all.
So he watched things unfold in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a scoreless game into a deflate game.
&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything like that,&quot; Ellis commented.
The second quarter started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under gloomy clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles making a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players took a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the fourth, one of these when a cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds left.
&quot;I didn&#39;t go out of my way,&quot; Favre said of all the steps going to Coles.
&quot;He is a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think. &quot;
While Favre and Coles were playing in the dam, the Cardinals defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking throw and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was fouled by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked it 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
They are the biggest points the Jets ever made in a quarter.
A Team coach, Eric Mangini, ask him to describe the madness of this moment, he said: &quot;The second quarter or the third quarter?&quot;
When answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, &quot;I can say I liked the second quarter much more than the third.
They have earned a ton of points in a very short period of time. &quot;
Gebrselassie rested tops his world record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown why many consider him the greatest runner in history, beating his own world record in the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person capable of running the 26.2 mile race in 2 hours. 4 minutes.
Following the victory in the easy-going flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, set last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance from time trial to marathon.
In the past month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming in hindsight - that air pollution would exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up to race in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using a cutting 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile on average.
Since when track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have converted over long distances, the marathon record has been lowered by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Brazil&#39;s Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06 : 05 in 1998.
After Sunday&#39;s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
Obviously the suspension left you cool, not rusty.
&quot;I am very happy,&quot; Gebrselassie told reporters.
&quot;Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well. &quot;
The athlete has come under some criticism - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia&#39;s Afro-eastern rival - for the style of orchestrating his careers too much, generally avoiding meeting many world marathon stars, relying on pacemakers as if It will be a race track, and putting the records ahead of the competition sense.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie&#39;s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached the middle of the race in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after his pacemakers decreased.
But just before three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie took one last push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by nearly five minutes.
Kamathi came to third place in 2:07:48.
In the women&#39;s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her personal best record in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He did a smart math race, letting a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners head first, then picking them up after 18½ miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2: 21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, the pride and trials of life of color
Hidden by the sprawling park theme of the great Orlando, a few miles from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet town, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black-inhabited city incorporated in the country and the childhood place of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: &quot;the city of five lakes, three croquettes, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a jail. &quot;
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to honor Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described - making it a tourist spot as well by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers&#39; Draft Season&#39;s Project - remains a place apart. .
The city remains independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Ms. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida are often reluctant to share their true ideas with the white man, who &quot;knows so little about us and who does not know what he is missing. &quot;
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called for attention to begin a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain wary of the outsider.
&quot;We are very cautious about the way our story is told,&quot; said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city&#39;s oldest church.
&quot;It has to be correct.&quot;
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of almost 2,400 people who live under a level of poverty twice the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South - sometimes scorned, sometimes praised - that was born out of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville&#39;s image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her profound dialect books such as &quot;Mules and Men&quot; (1935) and &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a highway that runs through central Florida often forgotten in black history and human drama.
Having a concrete face in both life and literature, Ms. Hurston led her readers into the store owned by Eatonville&#39;s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
&quot;Off the road on the left,&quot; he wrote, &quot;there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write.&quot;
She also mentions Widow Dash&#39;s new husband and writes that Glenn Lee &quot;sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with temporary rooms.&quot;
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Ms. Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
Obviously this Fodor didn&#39;t.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
&quot;Zora described it as it was,&quot; said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls that Ms. Hurston immortalized by quoting men singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: &quot;Some people didn&#39;t like that.&quot;
Ms. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, is recalled that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without prior notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on dressing with dignity today.
Most of the residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
&quot;People were always very happy to see Zora,&quot; continues Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, rocking in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Ms. Hurston was probably baptized, &quot;she never stayed long.&quot;
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten about her too.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial ceremonies, no great public readings.
&quot;I don&#39;t think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood,&quot; said Valerie Boyd, author of &quot;Wrapped in Rainbows,&quot; a biography of Ms. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turnaround came in the &#39;80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street in the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was reeling from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred toward the community.
&quot;During that season, a group of white boys, they would go around town throwing oranges and everything at the people who were sitting next to them,&quot; said Mr. Franklin.
&quot;They also killed a girl, once.
They threw him at a watermelon in the car. &quot;
In a 1955 letter to Ms. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education &quot;insulted rather than honor my race.&quot;
A Residents say today that desegregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville&#39;s cohesion and undermined the confidence of its young people.
&quot;Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and at night,&quot; said NY Nathiri, Ella Dinkins&#39; daughter and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit organization. profit.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
&quot;I wasn&#39;t hugging your teacher because he was white - there is a cultural gap there,&quot; Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors, and artists who stepped above prejudice, just like she did, with buoyant, confident, and lines like: &quot;¿ How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I do not get it.&quot;
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous grave of Mrs. Hurston and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing it into American canons.
The highway project came just as Eatonville&#39;s most famous daughter was in the spotlight again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston&#39;s old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Ms. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its highway proposal.
&quot;The resurrected idea of the five-lane highway would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride,&quot; said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd put it more simply: &quot;Zora saved Eatonville.&quot;
The victory over the highway project has helped change the image of the city itself.
Out-of-town people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to the church here in 1993, started showing up in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (bearing the Hurston name, of course) opened in 2006, on a resurfaced and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can, at times, feel like you are on a street from the past in a summer rain, in a town as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Outsiders who come in search of Eatonville&#39;s history, of its significance, are still often treated with caution.
A Advance permission is required to do most interviews, and some things - like the murals in Eatonville&#39;s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the fields - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher with a soft spot for bright red, still fear that her island community could be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of hometown pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to view Eatonville the way Mrs. Hurston viewed her entire race: beauty, and all troubles, no better, no worse, and equally the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative , hardworking, silly and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin&#39;s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or for the Police Department, who He said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
&quot;Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, &#39;Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,&#39;&quot; says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
&quot;But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it is a very nice city.&quot;
Around here in New York, everyone is talking about finance fluently
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newsstands and giant television screens in Times Square, they wouldn&#39;t realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York are faced with the worst &quot;bad day of the week.&quot; the office &quot;since the slump of 1929.
Home delivery guys continue to rattle their metal tea carts across the sidewalks and carry muffin trays to breakfast gatherings.
Latino men continue to drag between loaded apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric patterned shirts hung from a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers are still waiting in line for their morning takeout, and it is still impossible to hail a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on weekdays.
Employees are still waiting in line for their bagels at the vendor carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts out there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time required for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of 20 or so people was already waiting.
And not in front of the clerk&#39;s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where longtime customers order their checkbooks, tourists look for directions to go to the Macy&#39;s department store and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my &quot;trusted personal banker&quot;, and they were in line for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from which they had switched them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They had gotten their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction company), from the credit unions and the savings banks of their hometown whose branches only function within the state of belonging, and which they claim to treat. to clients as well as to his family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $ 327 billion of assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with a few deposits savings of $ 440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The office and store workers who stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank in what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the bailouts on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, was referring to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distressed-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter with familiarity as if complaining about the inactivity of a colleague.
And Lyn, a fiftieth and somewhat uniformed janitor from my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the grocer.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that &quot;I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The commutation is done, I&#39;m not taking any risks. &quot;
Lives to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford music director since 1962, Vernon &quot;Tod&quot; Handley (obituary, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It&#39;s supposed to be for the under 21s, but by the time Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were reaching our twenties - we just refused to give up the chorus.
The name &quot;Proteus&quot; (the mythological form-changing being) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether unaccompanied or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all due to that man&#39;s inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
Tod often told us to &quot;let the music speak for itself.&quot;
He would say: &quot;The composer knows what he wants.
It&#39;s all there, in the music.
So you just have to sing! &quot;
His wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never imposing, nor overly flowery.
Whatever the musical weeding, it always ended at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades that he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I have reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that never, by any, have I been disappointed - otherwise, many times I have been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply &quot;sold one or two very well known warhorses around the world.&quot;
We will miss much less.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
in his William Woodruff sequel (25 September) he states that &quot;in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he won a Houblon-Norman research fellowship ... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor&#39;s degree, one a master&#39;s degree and a doctorate. &quot;
This is learned in a note from Woodruff&#39;s author in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor JD Chambers, and later published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years 1950-51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman fellowship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he definitely left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to skip this part of his career remains unknown.
Muslim graves desecrated as Austria moves closer to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the far-right Austria Freedom Party, and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated with the far-right Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to introduce the organization &quot;Cities Against Islamization&quot; in Antwerp , on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs that represent mosques with a red line running through them.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country&#39;s general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, on some of the graves, but investigators think this may have occurred in an attempt to hide the real motives of the extremists fueled by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear if the incident was in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were &quot;deeply shocked&quot; by the news of the desecration, which reached religious Muslims as the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the turn to the right in yesterday&#39;s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that grabbed nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were upheld. xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and also voiced opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At their last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a &quot;European brotherhood&quot; to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing policy of Islamization in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyzes carried out in the immediate aftermath of the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, indicate that the shift came mainly from young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Overseas travel ban for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Kent police issued the overseas travel ban last Thursday after magistrates had produced evidence of Glitter&#39;s previous convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: &quot;On Thursday September 25 at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling abroad such as to France and Spain until 25 September March.
&quot;Paul Gadd did not attend in person.&quot;
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the sex offender registry.
He has to inform the authorities in case he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary that you inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss the individual case or Glitter&#39;s possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: &quot;The Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: &quot;The Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
&quot;From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have the systems here to manage all potential risks more effectively.
&quot;Protecting the people of Kent is the primary concern of the Kent Police and we work closely to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risks that may exist to the public.&quot;
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls, ages 10-11.
When Glitter was released he flew to Bangkok, where he caught a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to Magistrates Court in Uxbridge, West London, after Scotland Yard had successfully enforced the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of Home Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and happy to learn that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
&quot;I capture the master offstage to extract his character&quot; Günther Bauer_Photographer
Neither heels nor ruffles nor premiere outfits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration in the interpretation to obtain the relaxed aspect of the man or the woman.
To one side the artist.
To the other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in those moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of hands, carefree because they are not going to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer alternates in &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; the theatricality of some productions with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser-known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition &quot;reflects the international importance of flamenco, growing every day&quot;, explains the creator, who clarifies that &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; &quot;can be anybody but, when looking at the photos, the observer realizes that these are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed &quot;in the street&quot; are artists capable of transmitting passion, sadness, joy on stage ... captivating the public.
You don&#39;t have to take photos of the stage to capture the personality of these artists.
They carry their personality and character within.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco &quot;.
With the flavor of the &quot;Cante de las Minas&quot; festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, are reminiscent of classic photography.
The application of different stylistic means breaks with the classical base of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: &quot;A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day&quot;.
It is not the action of the dance, the cante or the toque itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the El Fotomata gallery.
Well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, make up this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer&#39;s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with &quot;Portraits of Veteran Athletes&quot; (&quot;SportARTproject&quot;).
Although the concepts are different in &quot;Flamenco-people&quot;, the photographer admits that &quot;I love portraying people, meeting them and being able to enter their life for a moment, be it a long or a short moment.
I think that within photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, that sometimes you don&#39;t even know, or that leave you only a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true. &quot;
This collection of portraits of current flamenco entitled &quot;Flamenco-people&quot; is exhibited in the Galería El Fotomachta, located at number 20 de la Mata street, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where it can be visited until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is &quot;reckless&quot;
It is set in places that he does not yet know and deals with unknown matters, but even so, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to carry out the new project he is working on, a novel that stars Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday during his time at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project he is dealing with today &quot;is reckless&quot; and that &quot;everything indicates that he should not write&quot; the novel.
&quot;If I were sensible, I would not do it, but I am going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime&quot;, he concluded in his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen a hundred pass through the city of the Aqueduct of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of &quot;The city and the dogs&quot; was one of the leading figures of the third edition of the festival of the word and fulfilled the predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the writer most voted by the participants - an old edition of Dickens&#39;s &quot;Our mutual friend&quot; - filled the capacity of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found in front of him a devoted audience to which the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, was very short, reviewed how his literary vocation, derived from the &quot; extraordinary adventure &quot;of the&quot; pleasure of reading &quot;and&quot; living more than what I lived &quot;; how he writes in a &quot;disciplined way&quot; to make up for his &quot;lack of inspiration&quot; with intense documentation work, correcting and redoing a lot; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced their vocation and what &quot;images of memory&quot; are the basis on which their stories are based.
The Hispanic American novelist acknowledged that &quot;there is no way&quot; to measure and know if books change life, &quot;but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience,&quot; said Vargas Llosa, who said that it &quot;has effects &quot;and&quot; makes people more dissatisfied &quot;, so he asked the writers&quot; not to give in to frivolity &quot;and&quot; assume responsibility &quot;their vocation.
The weather reduces the Pozoblanco fair, which also runs out of rejones
The celebration of rejones that closed the season ticket for the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the rejoneadores announced that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
Thus, the company, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bullfight.
The inclement weather has been primed with this fair, since finally two of its three celebrations have not been able to celebrate.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
The cartel was made up of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a confinement in Castilblanco
Thus, only on Friday was there a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and went on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante paid off his two horns with greetings and an ear, which were more awarded by the stretches than by his bullfighting.
Of course, El Juli was even worse, who passed through the Los Llanos arena without pain or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief job he won the anger of a large part of the public.
They skip a control in Álava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Ten to five in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop the two occupants of a van and they flee.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, was not to stop.
The agents chased them and detained one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as AAJ, according to a statement from the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of a public document.
The incident occurred when several officials from the Álava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control on the N-1, as it passed through the municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, accelerated sharply and skipped control.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later on the shoulder, at which point its two occupants got out to run through a wooded area.
The ertzainas finally caught up with one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were transporting and which they found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with bales of hashish, so they proceeded to transfer it to the police for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials verified that the license plate had been &quot;doubled&quot; since it did not coincide with the one collected in the documentation of the van, which is why the arrested person has also been charged with a crime of falsifying a public document.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape on the run as has been said, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, 28-year-old AAJ, was transferred to the police station to carry out the corresponding proceedings and will be brought to justice in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of some medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol has revealed to People magazine.
The witness has detailed that at around 4.30 pm, Locklear &quot;was stepping on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and when going in reverse, he passed over his sunglasses several times. &quot;.
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who apparently did not initially recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who called the emergency services because &quot;she was worried about Locklear&#39;s life.&quot;
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
&quot;It seemed disoriented&quot;, reason why the agents took it to the specialized center of drugs and alcohol to realize a test to him.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess of alcohol was ruled out from the beginning, although &quot;as the officers observed at first glance, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication.&quot;
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison around 7:00 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its powers in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, assured today that it will be the regional training federation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilor for Youth and Sports of the Seville City Council, Francisco Manuel Silva, who He resigned last week after he was accused of carrying out favorable treatment of relatives.
&quot;For these things I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to assume its powers,&quot; said Llamazares about the action that the party must adopt with the one who until now councilor in the Sevillian consistory.
However, the IU leader defended that the need for &quot;transparency&quot; to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva may have committed: &quot;IU has always defended that these types of matters have the maximum degree of transparency.&quot;
Along the same lines, he stressed that training has &quot;strict ethical codes for all public positions.&quot;
&#39;Blood of May&#39;, Garci&#39;s epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of close to 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to &quot;illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis&quot; that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría leading a wide cast of performers.
Sangre de mayo, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, opens this Friday in cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid lasting more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós&#39;s literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this filming &quot;a childhood dream&quot;, for which he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary on May 2 in Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitutes for Garci a &quot;unique opportunity&quot; to set the portrait of &quot;a reckless Spain that was the wrong boss to fight for, with the right sets and costumes. that, the fight for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Fernando VII &quot;, he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding such as that of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de Mayo-, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes embodied in a script signed together with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Again to begin, has influenced what is his usual way of working, staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearsals before starting the filming and to whom he does not do casting, as he thinks &quot; humiliating &quot;and consider that&quot; part of the director&#39;s job is to go to the theater and the cinema to find out what is happening in the industry in which he works. &quot;
Many of the interpreters with whom he coincides in Sangre de Mayo repeat before his camera, as is the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate for the Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, Seven French Billiard Tables and the one finally selected, The blind sunflowers do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, &quot;which is the one that should make itself known,&quot; he assured.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
&quot;In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you are content with making one more film,&quot; explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional experience.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillian dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillian bailaora is going to honor a Sevillian dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer in the liberation of women, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
&quot;I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me and I thought it was incredible.&quot;
According to the bailaora, &quot;we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of their dances have suggested flamenco styles to me.
Thus, &quot;the dance of the butterfly&quot; suggested a guajira to me, or &quot;the dance of the snake&quot; some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic &quot;, he affirms.
The show has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in that of &quot;La puerta Abierto&quot;; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever her student was.
&quot;Matilde plays Tórtola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy that he has agreed to act in my work and I am very honored by it. &quot;
The show also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the cante of Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, &quot;who plays the role of the eternal companion of these types of artists who were divas in their entirety, and who are always in love of them&quot;.
The work also tells in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, since she habitually resided in London .
&quot;I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of those women who have enormous influence at a certain time and now no one knows, much less value her work,&quot; says Bayón.
The show will begin today at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theater.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology
&quot;I recommend José Vicente Resino&#39;s exhibition&quot; Flamenco y vida &quot;because his black and white photographs, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and for the strength they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments &quot;.
The publication of the &quot;Diary of a newly married poet&quot; also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the &quot;Diary of a Newlywed Poet&quot; in Saint Stephen&#39;s Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía to celebrate the &quot;Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium&quot; (2006-2008), organized in order to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the &quot;Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium&quot; comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel House Museum and with the traveling exhibition &quot; Juan Ramón Jiménez: That poplar of light &quot;, which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
Likewise, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of 800 copies of the &quot;Diary of a Newlywed Poet&quot;, edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America is less liked without Paul Newman
&quot;Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them. &quot;
The phrase is from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in &quot;Absence of Malice&quot;, and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, before the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
Look how hard it was to give him an Oscar.
And that he was retired since 2007.
And that it was known that he was very ill.
Still it has been a blow to everyone.
&quot;Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and now I have lost a great friend&quot;, cried Robert Redford, &quot;my life and my country were better thanks to his existence.&quot;
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of the cinema and of the country had died at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue, men and very few beings to admire remain, you don&#39;t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a staunch enemy of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and won causes, from the anti-drug foundation created in honor of his first-born overdose to his brand of homemade and organic food.
Quite a gift to a country that has had a hard time overcoming a suicidal food culture.
The shock wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was neither more nor less than the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
&quot;He has set the bar very high for all of us&quot;, stated George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the demand for probity and having a serious and remote private life of the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today&#39;s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He was divorced once but then he was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when he surely had plenty of opportunities not to be.
&quot;But why am I going to eat a hamburger outside the house, if I have steak inside?&quot;, He used to joke.
In heaven he is proud of the fact that on earth his daughters coincide with their fans, something not so common in America.
&quot;Of all the great roles he played, none was so proud of him as devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,&quot; they say.
The imperfect career of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is to have an Olympics in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday&#39;s race, I say no!
They called it the perfect race, and in my opinion it was the worst race I have ever been in by far.
A height of nonsense that, of course, if they took it into account as an evaluation and I examined it, it would be a very clear failure.
But let&#39;s go in parts and from the beginning.
The nonsense begins with the collection of the number, which makes you have to go first.
Which doesn&#39;t seem bad to me, but if they already make you go, give it your all (including the chip to avoid queues at the race).
Well no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the number (first nonsense, go just for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise! There was only size &#39;S&#39; for the shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with fewer and cheaper fabrics?
Well, things like this are trivial compared to race day.
Apart from having to go very early to collect the chip, the queue when arriving is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race began and we still had not left the backpack, although once it was achieved, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain enlivened the wait of more than 40 minutes, which was combined with attempts of popular rebellion and an assault on the booth.
I think that some 500 people will surely have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me will not even appear with the correct time in qualifying, due to the chip they gave me that, I imagine, did not start me correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, it would not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft has shown an advance of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company&#39;s campus) attending to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a face and shape recognition system, this &quot;receptionist&quot; can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group those present according to conversation groups.
In the sample video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and he says he will see you shortly.
All without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there has been much talk about a change in strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
Quite a find considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and &quot;extras&quot; to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome went online, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google&#39;s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to understand each other.
It fulfills the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
It&#39;s true.
It will never disappear but you have to think of the &quot;death&quot; of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts up only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the windows environment.
What are half of the applications that come in the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less cluttered, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and that they are finally an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
I took the photo for this post in one of Microsoft&#39;s employee break rooms in Redmond earlier in the month.
At the soda machine a sign asks them to use its search tool - &quot;Your search. Our future.&quot;
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather throwing at 2010.
Microsoft will surely be looking for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The telephone, after all, is becoming more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, is going to take its toll.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d&#39;Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick&#39;s &#39;Blood Diamond&#39;, the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s &#39;The Godfather&#39; and it is part of the muscular gay parish uniform.
And if we start to list stellar appearances, we can go back to the image of that strongman with a pointed mustache who lifted weights in a traveling circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men&#39;s cotton underwear T-shirt, close-fitting and sleeveless.
The &#39;tank&#39;, which Anglo speakers call it, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all the others.
First, because of its bombastic name - although it is familiarly known as &#39;Marcel&#39; - which has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
&#39;La Marcel&#39; stands out from the rest for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian firm&#39;s production is not only focused on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sailor shirts, babies, mini shorts ...
Garments designed for underwear comfort.
Although it is a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
Second round for Honda&#39;s best seller
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation Jazz.
If its predecessor already had ample habitability, this new minivan presents an even wider interior space.
Added to all this are refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz arrives six years after introducing the first generation to the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period of time than that used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, a country where the Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan about a million units of the Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
Regarding the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda&#39;s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those responsible for the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, those responsible for the brand expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
Likewise, the Japanese firm expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota, Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact size - 4.37 meters in length - of which the Japanese company expects to market about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once it is presented in society in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its dimensions.
Its length amounts to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the wheelbase up to 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Likewise, the boot capacity - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the boot capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measurements are for the version with the 1.4 engine, since the boot capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Also new are the engines in this second generation Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two gasoline engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-liter mechanics gets a power of 90 horses at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 turns.
This engine - which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
With respect to the previous engine, which in the previous generation achieved 83 horses, now it has 100.
This 100 horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
&quot;I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn&#39;t worry me&quot;
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is petite but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the Mango firm does in its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, she wins at short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have devised for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the &#39;Mango Fashion Awards&#39; and the Opera dinner in honor by Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but, at the same time, exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get many references.
Then, I really like getting lost in a city and observing women how they are dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you are a very versatile woman, right?
I think so but, in the end, everything comes together and they have many ties in common.
Since I was little I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother&#39;s house to rummage through my aunt&#39;s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You already know that dancers really like to make ourselves our outfits for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when they give you the costumes is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You have turned 30 not long ago, have you had a crisis?
No way.
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is done, has experience and savors life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock does not scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was little and this has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I am going to be a mother because my body demands it and, furthermore, I want to be a young mother; I don&#39;t want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I am not concerned.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are aware of several premieres that you shot last year.
That&#39;s right and I&#39;m already looking forward to them seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I want everything for now and of course, it cannot be.
I&#39;m looking forward to the premiere of &#39;The Last Hour&#39; and &#39;In Search of the Tomb of Christ&#39;.
Let&#39;s see what you think ...
A few days ago you debuted on a runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don&#39;t say that.
It&#39;s not that I got on a catwalk to be a model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for a long time, called me to invite me to come to London to participate in a charity show for her organization &#39;Women for a better world&#39; and the clothes that we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - auctioned to raise money for this NGO of Naomi.
People are unaware of Naomi&#39;s tender heart.
So many things are said about her that, I who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
Also, I keep that good part in which she gets involved.
He asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if he asks me to do a handstand, then too.
To benefit third world women, whatever it takes.
The &#39;bee car&#39; that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, specifically, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision avoidance technologies.
Engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have developed this little robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Managing Director of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C comes as an extension of Nissan&#39;s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to reinforce the collision avoidance capabilities of the brand&#39;s vehicles.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the bee&#39;s compound eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles that are up to two meters away within a 180 degree radius in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to said object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately results in the prevention of the collision.
&quot;The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right angle or greater to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is that the avoidance maneuver is totally instinctive.
If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, &quot;explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and principal engineer for this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot drift up or down, or diagonally; It can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allow it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, for the little robot to avoid collisions.
&quot;This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It does not require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can run continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we are not talking about gigabytes of memory, not even megabytes. &quot;
This is the first step in developing new instant collision avoidance technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in series cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the lithium-ion variety.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to their destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Repeated drivers for alcohol must install the &#39;alcolock&#39;
Interior wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcohol, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle drunk, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the State Attorney General&#39;s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reintegration of the driver, so he will also receive a road re-education course.
In the experience, in addition to the General Prosecutor for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for drunk driving take the car again.
The alcolock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow open; or when an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than the allowed one.
Its cost is greater than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the sanctioned person.
In this sense, a study carried out in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of implementation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address these behaviors before they lead to criminal offenses.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and, nevertheless, the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been experimentally implemented in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow an initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without &#39;peep-toes&#39;
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., the time scheduled in the program, the Spanish air force plane in which the Princes of Asturias were traveling landed at the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to see the royal couple alight from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours before, he had asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you will not be able to go to the airport to load at that time ... She is from here or so ...
- No, no sir, she is Spanish but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good ...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many who wait in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who interpret the salute of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, hair blowing in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual &#39;peep-toes&#39;, perhaps she had been told that a storm was threatening in Mexico City.
They give a smile and a brief stop to the photographers before going to the room where the official procession awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the city&#39;s Big Four, a talkative reporter from Mexican television awaits them.
Tremble before you mortgage
Admittedly, the US Treasury Department, in addition to having plenty of liquid for injections, is not lacking in ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in banks of questionable solvency, they have created an entertaining and informative game for the browser: &#39;Bad Credit Hotel&#39;.
In other words, the &#39;Hotel of bad credits&#39; ... or trouble.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, twice and even three times if it is time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful information, but little detailed.
It is more of a page for teens than a site for all audiences.
What happens if the game is completed?
Well, a dream room appears inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we don&#39;t even talk about buying a better house ...
The best endowed award in fashion
There is possibly no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is possibly no more exquisite and bont vivan living designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Button-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango shop window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and it has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the contest, led us to end up with a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with a heart broken with grief and acting on the guts, due to the recent death of her brother, put on a House suit and some ELAH dressings, which took her breath away, and on the arm of her son Luis - a cannon almost two meters in length - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is such a gentleman that he ended up, together with the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had loaned them to two ladies.
Mónica Cruz, who came to the store with pants and a shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she transformed into a long black sexy dress, she was moved when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of ballet rehearsal and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a feint of &#39;grand plie&#39;.
Inés Sastre did not stay for a walk around the palace premises, but beforehand she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to rejoice with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon that moves on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously requested that there were no smells in your room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c&#39;est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 plus one ways to forget the chaotic and hectic everyday life.
And as if that were not enough, everyone is gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 in the morning, but it is even worse to imagine yourself involved in the hectic rhythm that today&#39;s life imposes.
The office is called stress and the computer is backache.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily burnout and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Apart from the yoga positions, the classic massage or the &#39;spa&#39; treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole &#39;menu&#39; of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each one.
The anti-stress work is called &#39;1001 ways to relax&#39; and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this &#39;manual&#39; refutes that belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline is no longer running through your veins to restore balance to the body and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talking asleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very savvy telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens, you may get scared, but it doesn&#39;t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disturbance called somniloquies.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in a lifetime for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (peeing while sleeping) or sleepwalking, but it does not have to be the case.
As we have already mentioned previously, they can also be associated with very high fever, situations of stress or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also highly variable.
It may be that he speaks in a calm tone of voice, single words, a murmur or the opposite (screaming, crying, long speeches ...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives it a way out in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a condition of stress).
What can be done is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid television programs or series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and have a hard time relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a calmer sleep.
Once the somniloquies appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what happened.
Helpful tips
Don&#39;t wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Although he is talking, he is sleeping and therefore he is resting.
Remember that if he is very distressed during several episodes, it would be advisable to consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not the most common), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You will not achieve anything, because when you are asleep you are not conscious enough to organize your thinking.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with which you are very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions that you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, do not worry, it is not bad, it is an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found its way to victory in its field after a long period of scarcity.
Without having had a good game, the team created many scoring chances and was able to score a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who brushed the square with a shot from afar, Illhaeusern was almost going to take &quot;power&quot; and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or Diebold also came to prevent Dannemarie&#39;s defense.
In front, we did not let the midfielder pass and we only left Riahi in attack position.
The beginning of the second half was crucial, first with two scoring chances by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the scoring for the Illhousiens with the Marais goal, well placed to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53 &#39;).
But striker Illhousiens won&#39;t be able to savor his happiness for long and will be forced back into the wardrobe a dozen minutes later, leaving his teammates outnumbered.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who fell back a bit to &quot;compress&quot; their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after a major sputter, the ball passed very close to the field. cross.
Sarkozy finds the angry fishermen
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Britain.
Faced with the manifestation of resistance from the fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in Finistère, to find there to their representatives.
They promised to welcome him &quot;with a constructive spirit&quot; and hope that &quot;he will come with concrete proposals.&quot;
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the &quot;crisis committee&quot; created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the increase in diesel prices, which sets a record by reaching 1.14 euros per liter.
According to the Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president &quot;will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors.&quot;
The fishermen await Nicolas Sarkozy on firm footing.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in the Morbihan and Calvados, thus causing traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The Quiberon marina has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
A &quot;filtering barrier&quot; has been put up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, at dawn, wooden tires and pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and La Mancha, such as in Les Sables d&#39;Olonne, in Vendée, where the bous stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the trading vessels.
In the afternoon, the fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped the blockade of the important Total de Donges refinery.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday&#39;s meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the &quot;crisis committee&quot; will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
&quot;The strike will continue&quot; because &quot;the fishermen did not give up&quot; and &quot;they do not want to move to Paris&quot;, announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but consider that the financial break-even point of a boat can be reached only with diesel with a price below 0.30 euro per liter.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of &quot;Two men and one destiny&quot; has died of cancer, at the age of 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the movie legend and the engaged actor, Paul Newman, who has passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
The fourth largest aeronautical manufacturer in the world, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed the president of Embraer, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies a lot on the Chinese market particularly to sell the planes ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurer American International Group, which has been bailed out thanks to the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its loan of 85 billion dollars, according to Sunday&#39;s edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and its retirement insurance in the United States, says this newspaper.
AIG&#39;s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to review eventual sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets from which AIG intends to divest include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, pursues the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly realize liquidity to repay its loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve granted to it at the risk of seeing the American authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the due proportion among the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a loss never seen in the Stock Market of almost 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, that is, the day on which exchanges started again after the terrorist attacks of 11 of September.
The Nasdaq index, the technological dominant one, fell 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the widened (extended) Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500 index by 8.81% (that is, 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 units, based on final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, the representatives denied US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
About two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
&quot;That is not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,&quot; estimated Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
&quot;This shows to what extent the market was counting on this plan,&quot; added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within days will be &quot;too late.&quot;
&quot;If the project is really moribund (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the American central bank, N. de la Red) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions&quot;, said Brian Bethune, head of Economics and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, &quot;with each passing day the fall of a financial institution is announced&quot; in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities arranged the purchase of Wachovia&#39;s banking activities by rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, showing that the markets are facing &quot;not just a crisis in the US but a a global crisis, &quot;added the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market rose dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond fell by 3.632%, against 3.827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4.161%, against 4.357% the day before.
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its listing on the stock market.
A week after discovering an interim agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a unit price of $ 25.25, or an amount of $ 3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars with the purchase of convertible securities, which will ensure a return of 10% and a conversion price of $ 31.25.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global operation would be carried out based on a price per unit of measure of $ 29, that is, 28% above its current exchange rate.
The Morgan Stanley stock was nonetheless down 6.79% at $ 23.07 apiece at 17:00 GMT.
&quot;This strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley&#39;s transition to the status of a bank holding company,&quot; explained Juan Mack, the CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to diversify its activities, but it passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Its alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the biggest names on Wall Street to adopt a much more cautious behavior than before.
The modalities presented last Monday also show that the agreement has been modified in recent days: last Monday, Morgan had announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for almost 8.5 billion dollars.
&quot;A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the chief executive of MUFG, explained in Tokyo,&quot; we thought that the stake would have been made up of just ordinary shares.
But in view of the current state of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize risks and hedge ourselves. &quot;
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will translate into a dilution of about 20% of earnings per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert within a year half of its preferred securities into common shares if these are sold with more than 50% above the conversion price, or at $ 47 more or less, during a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow it to take investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group nevertheless refused to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of close to 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan claimed to have eased his balance a lot since late August.
The last few weeks were grueling for the group, which saw its stock price drop by half as the cost of security against a default risk on its debt took off.
This cost fell last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other &quot;survivor&quot; of the big Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced to have raised $ 15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Refound the republic around the socialism of the XXI century.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, is the third that he put to the vote a project for a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of the voters voted &quot;yes&quot; to the referendum, according to the official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the &quot;no&quot; obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid votes and 0.7% were blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the exit of the polling stations and a recount by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory for &quot;yes&quot;, estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night from Sunday to Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The &quot;Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly,&quot; he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calm, according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the &quot;new socialism&quot; defended by the president.
The draft Constitution implies increasing the power of the State over the economy, reserving the &quot;development planning&quot; of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants strengthened powers to the head of state, who may serve up to two consecutive terms of four years each and will have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally envisages the interdiction of the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
Obama, winner during the first televised duel
The first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House was followed by another to find out who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain&#39;s performance, while honorable, was not &quot;brilliant enough&quot; to allow him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama five points of advantage (49% against 44% for McCain), judges that it is the Democrat who came out well.
Among undecided voters, who are the ones that count, Obama emerged victorious with 39% of those polled, while 25% of them concede the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his member of the same candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
&quot;It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
He has good instincts, &quot;however warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The septuagenarian McCain put in evidence his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining the &quot;naivety&quot; of his adversary on these questions that were at the heart of this first confrontation.
&quot;Senator Obama doesn&#39;t seem to understand that ...&quot; he accused several times.
&quot;I do not believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president,&quot; he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in the Republican televised advertisements.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Undeterred, he was concise and precise.
It enhanced their ability to make good decisions, and to restore America&#39;s image in the world.
&quot;McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done,&quot; replied this weekend, a Democratic television advertisement that reproached the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans. &quot;
&quot;During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an electoral meeting in North Carolina under heavy rain.
He did not utter the words &quot;middle class&quot; or &quot;workers.&quot; &quot;The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans as the person most capable of saving the economy who is on the edge of the precipice.
&quot;Next week could be a decisive episode&quot;, estimated, yesterday, the influential and democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a longtime member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama&#39;s &quot;good economic instincts&quot; to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster &quot;is the final consequence of eight years of bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.&quot;
Reaffirming that he would manage to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans despite the shocks of Wall Street, the senator from Illinois also pointed out that the realization of an eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies it was his first priority, with the creation of a health and safety system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Cautious, both candidates dodged questions regarding the $ 700 billion (€ 470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
&quot;In Minsk,&quot; Have you noticed the elections in Minsk? &quot;
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the legislative results in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: &quot;the dictator has to resign.&quot;
Some admit not having voted: &quot;for what, since they will do what they want with my vote&quot;, says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put a good face on foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to effect democratic change.
The sanctions, among which the interdiction of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered as fair for observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
&quot;We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers could not participate in the counting of the votes,&quot; lamented Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
&quot;It is a cosmetic change, underlines Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive branch.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
&quot;But his entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bills.&quot;
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because &quot;dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts to Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent. &quot;
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He emphasizes that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) favored manipulations.
&quot;Have you noticed the elections? Question the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one at the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies to parliament, those who are best suited to power. &quot;
The silence of the night returns again in the October square.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission congratulate each other on their success.
The 19 kidnapped people have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good when they arrived at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to the Cairo international airport.
Helicopters immediately transported them to hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, to undergo medical tests, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
&quot;They are in good health&quot; and &quot;no ransom was paid&quot; to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell into the hands of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an ATV safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since moved from one pit to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency, in charge of organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official indicated that 30 members of the special forces, carried aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
&quot;An exchange of shots took place, and they killed half of the kidnappers, the rest have fled,&quot; said this official who kept anonymous.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the &quot;lightning&quot; unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by secret agents and by members of the Italian special forces.
&quot;It must be recognized that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the secret services, from the special forces,&quot; he declared without going into detail.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a jeep on board during a patrol that contained the hijackers, killing six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
He also claimed that they were related to a Darfurian rebel group, the Sudan Liberation Movement-Unity, (SLA-U), a claim that this group immediately denied.
Lyrics - Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture fait les manchettes and occupies the current electoral campaign.
Better this way.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the miserable sums awarded to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or starving national historic sites?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government to neglect its monuments and its heritage buildings?
Why don&#39;t we have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government dedicates three and a half million euros to restore only the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all the elected and all government departments, and all this, in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Quebec History Societies, at least 40,000 benevolent persons grouped into 211 history, heritage, archival and genealogy societies are concerned with searching through history, preserving lots of archives with little money private and preserve archaeological remains.
It is these who are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and officials throw their bulldozers at our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
By when, a monument for history and heritage?
The Interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary of its founding yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to be happy, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most efficient suppliers of blood in the world.
Most of all, it regained the public&#39;s trust that had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and the public&#39;s discontent, the Canadian government conducted a public survey in February 1994, presided over by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such a disaster did not occur. play more.
While Judge Krever was slow to present his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a consequence of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Society of Blood to supply all other provinces and both territories.
&quot;In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Québec, recalls Décary.
The situation was grim.
After having put in a lot of effort to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained the confidence of the public, &quot;he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Québec population From now on it had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary recalls that &quot;trust is extremely fragile.&quot;
Since its creation, on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we were witnessing in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we did not know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
So we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emanate from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we institute exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, some years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense. &quot;
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that make it possible to detect the presence of the virus directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests were based. tests used so far.
Nucleid acid tests made it possible to shorten the period between the moment in which the person has been infected and the moment in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
Thus, we substantially reduce the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
&quot;That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Thus, since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs through a blood product.
I believe that nowadays it is possible to receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to regain health without worries &quot;, affirms the head of the Héma-Québec administration.
&quot;Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
You have to be constantly vigilant &quot;, pursues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
&quot;The needs increase because the population ages.
As the more aggressive anticancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which includes on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate blood. &quot;
However, all 18-year-olds in good health who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of the people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
&quot;With this 3%, we were able to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of the hospitals.
Hardships are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since life today is so unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate their blood &quot;, Francine Décary grieves.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, among which bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Québec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
&quot;We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the placing in the bank of our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and it is expected to obtain more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year, &quot;says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
&quot;Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot enjoy this,&quot; since Héma-Québec does not have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Québec.
Softball - The Impact in the Semifinals
The Impact of Montreal qualified for the semifinals of the elimination series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory by 3-1 (4-3 in short ends) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the quarterfinal series, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first half without a goal from either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many scoring chances.
Roger Levesque was the only one who thwarted Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the round-trip series on Friday, Impact had suffered a 2-1 loss at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The Impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon at Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the second leg to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nonetheless agreed in the semifinals 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev&#39;s winning goal
The Canadian&#39;s number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit comprised of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn enlivened the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian on barrier free throws against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec racked up two assists, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the Tricolor&#39;s fourth in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory scoring the only goal.
&quot;I&#39;m not ready yet, warned the Russian.
&quot;I need another game to feel comfortable.&quot;
He tried to play his best in the first half, Guido Carbonneau scored.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation. &quot;
Charest takes care of the North
The prime minister does not exclude starting elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today&#39;s by-election.
To reject the limits of our last great northern frontier &quot;: such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force, staying on the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Quebec Liberal Party, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
Spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining exploitation, of Quebec as seen by &quot;Google Maps&quot;, maps, etc., paraded on three huge screens.
Large media such as during the electoral period.
The prime minister thinks that the elections will take place this fall, although he did show that his schedule was very full.
The &quot;North Plan&quot; is the fourth side of a &quot;vision&quot; that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a &quot;new economic space&quot;, which includes a labor agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the prime minister&#39;s speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was &quot;a jewel of immense potential&quot;, but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains &quot;nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond,&quot; according to Mr. Charest&#39;s enumeration.
This &quot;territory twice as large as France&quot;, &quot;is our home, it is in Quebec.
It is not only our home, but it is in us, &quot;he insisted, as if to show that he was requesting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the flood to gold in Abitibi, Québec engineering, James Bay.
&quot;It belongs to us, it is our future,&quot; he added, having paused theatrically to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Québec&#39;s territory, comprises a part of Labrador that Québec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
&quot;It is a traditional position that all governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on the part of the government, &quot;he said.
In addition, &quot;with climate change, we must rethink our vision of the North,&quot; he declared, speaking of the Northwest Passage, which will open every year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuites?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers who come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebecois Ungava party), have already started consultations in about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role started some work.
The prime minister does not exclude an important meeting, &quot;not necessarily a summit&quot;, but a meeting in which &quot;a common vision will be given.&quot;
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan &quot;will be agreed, ordered and respectful of the environment,&quot; he promised.
Jean Charest described this &quot;vision&quot; as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
&quot;Like the liberals who came before us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.&quot;
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage to power of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Power Plant in Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
&quot;From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future&quot;, declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative one, the &quot;Roads to the North&quot; program by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the subject of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
&quot;This remains between us, but I anticipate being there,&quot; he confided to his militants, drawing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He stresses that his schedule is nonetheless full, particularly on account of a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly &quot;constitutional aspirations&quot; that had no problem being accepted: the Quebec Liberal Party demands in particular the recognition of the &quot;specificity of Quebec&quot; in the Constitution.
He also wanted Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and for them to have a veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the main lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Québec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Québec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, resigned from applying it.
If it had done so, &quot;we would make progress today&quot; commented Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
Accion Democratica du Québec appeared to support the government&#39;s adoption of a Plan Norte.
&quot;But what you want is that this is not just a show,&quot; said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns from vacation today.
Lyrics - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of &quot;Justice&quot; (oh irony!) In the Harper cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say that Luisa Arbor was a &quot;disgrace&quot; for Canada.
Thus dishonoring this woman who led an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for what she says about the relations between the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young adolescent when the events he is accused of occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, reneges on its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who chonta with a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order for him to enjoy the benefit of a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it cares little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after so many years of exactions.
We still do not realize that, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our &quot;democracy&quot;, that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that does not make sense.
The time has come when no morality exists anymore: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the hitherto minority head of government wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what made the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame Mr. Toews is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold&#39;s Orwellian Discourse
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the largest gold company in the world attempted a six million euro defamation suit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a &quot;transparent public debate&quot;.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions for defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm whoever dares to hold a position contrary to yours?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little consequence, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of the miner.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to bankrupt the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will muzzle the opposition as well as scare whoever will dare to re-examine the issue.
If Barrick Gold had truly wanted a public debate, it is in front of the public that it would have had to present its view of events.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are normally held for the exchange of ideas and not for blows of the club.
It was enough for the mining company to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold appears not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how you can call for a &quot;public&quot; debate while disregarding its views?
According to the vice president, it seems that this word designates only highly paid lawyers and not for all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand, is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so mainly because it rejects the brutal manner of the miner.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized changes of argument, and not in the context of what many people perceive as a chase-gag (in pursuit of the &quot;public debate&quot;, Barrick Gold has just deposited a requirement regarding the authors of Noir Canada encouraging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver&#39;s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of college search and the truth, essential to all democratic societies.
Denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that the rich companies of this world dislike in a country like Canada, under pain of many persecutions, who will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold truly wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the Noir Canada authors.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold&#39;s unbridled persecution clearly shows that, contrary to its claims, it does not feel like having a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is about time that governments put in place devices that limit this type of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Bailout Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $ 700 billion plan that aims to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It provides in particular: a better control by the elected of its implementation, of new mechanisms that seek to ensure the reimbursement of the public money invested, of the new provisions to contain the number of repossessed houses, the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the leaders of the assisted companies.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations that lasted two days.
&quot;We are making great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,&quot; said Bush Administration Representative Henry Paulson.
&quot;Everything has been done to protect the economy and ordinary Americans from the current crisis on Wall Street,&quot; explained the Democrat.
&quot;It&#39;s the bottom line: If we don&#39;t do this, the trauma, chaos, and disruption to daily life for Americans will be immense,&quot; said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been finished very quickly in the last hours because they feared the effect that a new failure would cause in the mood of the investors.
The last time they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have joined the negotiations late, were rather favorable to the agreement, without forgetting, however, to express their discontent at being forced to go to this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow the owners to keep their domicile and the one on the salary of the leaders of the companies surviving by the State.
&quot;When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no congratulations.
But these measures are necessary, &quot;he commented on American television.
His Republican adversary, John McCain, questioned on another network to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: &quot;I&#39;d like to see the details, but I hope to vote on it.&quot;
&quot;The important points that I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we can advance.
He said that the option of doing nothing is not acceptable. &quot;
The 700 billion plan seeks to buy with taxpayers&#39; money the doubtful debts, risk assets and unsaleable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages before spreading to other more common forms of credit instruments (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a rout of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have come out of the plateau since Democrats accepted that certain &quot;toxic&quot; assets of troubled companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to smooth things over for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would be intended to help you get money back.
The new plan foresees the payment of a first part of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote by Congress.
In exchange for its help, Washington will get shares in the aid companies that will pay dividends in case of profits and that it will be able to sell again when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the possibility to delay the foreclosure procedures concerning the houses obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and on the cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest against this bill yesterday, on the part of both Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his constituents that &quot;clearly, Washington does not want to understand.&quot;
&quot;We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of the taxpayers &quot;.
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who is a small group cheerleader in Congress, presents the issues differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
&quot;Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to us to say: we ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to take,&quot; he declared yesterday.
At this very moment, in Europe, we had again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had given up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars). ) during the risky home loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
&quot;This is not wasted money, Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos declared yesterday.
Instead, we regain a voting right in the bank and influence.
It&#39;s just something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain. &quot;
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($ 75.5 billion) of property loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it is the one that would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with a charming smile freed himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have distanced him from the register of power that true sacred monsters have.
But what a great long-distance runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday, aged 83, from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the glorious years.
He is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he closely resembled and who was long considered a rival in the cinema, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make gorgeous children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, latest quality brand.
Because in it a whole country in love with the self-made man, the war fighter of the Pacific, wounded in combat, was projected, who at the beginning of the 50s studied drama at Yale, then frequented the Actor&#39;s Studio in New York, before to succeed in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who was classified second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, dubbed by a sex symbol, although he was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress Joanne Woodward .
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the show business that we do not know very well, also disappear with him.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman sent moviegoers vertigo this weekend, as his great roles collide on the black screen of memories.
More than a half century of the ever-changing American seventh art parades through it.
Many memories come back to mind as the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Tin Roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958 .
Closer to us (1990), we evoke her sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not keep all its promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This rogue, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano in Robert Wise&#39;s Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, which truly launched Newman in 1956.
This likeable mangaman in the sumptuous movie The Sting, Oscar for best picture in 1973.
A bitter and avenging billiard player in Robert Rossen&#39;s magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese&#39;s The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar out of nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
Young people know him mainly thanks to George Roy Hill&#39;s Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 on The Coen Brothers&#39; The Hudsucker Proxy.
With one last role as godfather to the Irish mob in Sam Mendes&#39; Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was kinky.
Contrary to several legends of the cinema who left the race quite early, Newman stayed a lot in the world of cinema, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendor and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, &quot;as a challenge that lives in&quot; underplaying &quot;and who judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers arrived for a long time without doing anything.
Yet he played the role of a young gallant less often than a fringe: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard, or desperate, whose features reflected the rebellions.
As a filmmaker, Newman revealed little-known sides of his true modest sensibilities.
His 1968 film Raquel, Raquel (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, depicted a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott due to an overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a play of modesty and sadness.
&quot;Among the many tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade in arms Robert Redford (they had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened:&quot; my life and my country were better thanks to its existence &quot;
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen a lot of his face reign over the jars of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a bad taste method, although it started as a gag.
The proceeds of these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: &quot;Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege to be there. &quot;
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What did the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory produce?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner, in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor&#39;s Office, they used the funds obtained in public tenders for their own purposes, justifying on many occasions the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in total some 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and partly in the pockets of private individuals.
The method, which was also made known by the researchers, was to justify the collection of the funds obtained in the public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no real execution, the different associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were false.
For this they obtained the checkbooks in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that in the name of which company the falsified invoice should be made was decided among others in that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for his consumptions and these served as a model to prepare the invoices that they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as the City Council of the Capital.
Most of these invoices were signed by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his &quot;field trips&quot; Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
Well, a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however the bill included one hundred and thirty people.
But the manufacturers of fancy invoice also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. Because in the bookkeeping of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor&#39;s Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the manager of said company, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecution and they showed him the invoices, he already knew that they were false documents.
&quot;On the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place.&quot;
He added: in addition to the formal problems, it did not agree that according to the bill one hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers were also not informed that the chosen travel agency in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that on the invoice for cash payment they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency invoice issuance practice.
In addition - as it became known during the investigation - VAT was also included in the document, despite the fact that trips outside the territory of the European Union were tax exempt.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. For the Jobb Jövőért foundation, since the services of said company are not charged with 25 but only 15 percent VAT, In addition, the hotel employees only issued machine-made invoices, however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the &quot;dispatchers&quot; made other errors as well, as in the case of a company in which they put in the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport which - it was learned during the investigations of the prosecution - the company founded as a consultant does not perform investment.
Likewise, due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was learned that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI, are false. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. Or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The forgers also did not pay attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. Of Nyíregyháza was in the process of being liquidated, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
Consciously issued invoices
Another group of manufacturers of false invoices are made up of those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice for a value of about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of the Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
Similarly, Biogate Kft., Currently under liquidation, was collaborating with Zuschlag and his accomplices, which in 2003 provided invoices for an approximate value of five million HUF to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyő association. Egyesület, with no real economic activity behind.
There was no movement of capital either, because later they canceled the invoices prepared but forgot to record this entity in their documents.
The next group of manufacturers of false invoices includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trio SL with fictitious headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. Of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 is under a liquidation process.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices for Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány on behalf of the company, collecting the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. And Jos-Investment Bt. Were founded by Romanian bricklayers at the express request of Iván Kubatov.
However, none of the companies functioned effectively because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company&#39;s registration documents, they issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y -Generated.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor&#39;s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri limited partnership to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért presented a contest in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
From the contest they obtained 500 thousand HUF respectively, but they did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
So that this is not discovered, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the search of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the defendants will probably relate in the trial - as they did in the Prosecutor&#39;s Office - the course of the falsification of the invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
Well, his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not been done until now.
The question is: what is the interest in doing so? Well, perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the Socialists reached an agreement with him so that Zusi assumes all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to alleviate his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but it was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no possibility for that.
Overlapping Psychology: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are prone to spending more money and overvaluing the product.
Neurologists and economists at New York University discovered the neurological-economic basis for this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this &quot;game&quot; by means of experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played the lottery, the other participated in an auction and meanwhile the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) system.
In both games the participants could win money, but during the auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the &quot;reward&quot; mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to the scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction from the stratum.
To support their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial monitoring study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the true value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they win, they would receive an additional $ 15 prize.
On the other hand, the third group received exactly 15 dollars before the auction, but in case of losing the auction the members of the group lost even that money.
Thus, the only difference between the two groups was that for one the success was highlighted and for the other failure.
However, testing the neurologists&#39; hypothesis, the members of the group playing &quot;against failure&quot; were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the &quot;winning&quot; group.
&quot;These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
Well, those until now explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so now we come to a third explanation &quot;- said Andrew Schotter, professor at the New York University School of Economics.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the patients do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; Liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogen, spread in two main ways: hepatitis A and E by food (for example with contaminated water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and fluids bodily (sperm, vagina humor, saliva).
It is advisable for travelers to protect themselves by vaccination against viruses A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by a poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice appears on the skin and the whites of the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and healing can take up to two - three weeks.
Annually one million people die in the world in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten infected receives drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of those infected do not know they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and many times the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, premature recognition, systematic medical control, is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world with chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease can be cured if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, thus the contagion can be suppressed and cancer prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their early recognition.
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The States of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization to the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis in the North American market: the three countries will support in total with 11.2 thousand million euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held consultations at the highest level with the president of the European Central Bank and the head of economic competition at the European Commission.
Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the crisis in the Euro zone in the framework of the international financial crisis that has been occurring in several waves for more than a year, therefore the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a certain sense can be considered as precedents.
According to the decision adopted in the early hours of Sunday, the three states will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the property that the Bank owns in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a part of its businesses, including mainly the activities - mainly insurance - bought last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis shares began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this Bank is too big to allow it to fail.
Shares in the company on Friday alone declined 12 percent, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Looking at current share prices, the total value of the group&#39;s capital on the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to company executives this is not real.
The Bank&#39;s management attributed the sharp fall in Fortis shares to the insecurities of the North American market in connection with the approval of the US $ 700 billion package plan.
On Monday the shares already showed a slight increase.
Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank&#39;s new CEO on Friday.
The Bank also sought individual investors, but so far no one has made a specific offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors did not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
So far there has been no panic among the Bank&#39;s clients, they have not invaded the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed how religious belief influences human pain - reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
In the framework of this unique experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all of them were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scanning technique, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of investigations in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis occurred as follows; They attached a sparkling instrument to the patient&#39;s left hand, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the experiment participants to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato from the 17th century and the Lady with the Ermine by Leonardo da Vinci from the 15th century.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary spectacle would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo&#39;s oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
The patients spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing the painting with a religious theme or the other.
Catholics affirmed that by looking at the Virgin Mary they felt &quot;safe&quot; as &quot;protected&quot; people, &quot;they calmed down and peace reigned in their hearts.&quot;
When looking at the painting with a religious theme, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo&#39;s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image that is so impressive, a similar effect can be achieved with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
&quot;We should find the portrait of a person for whom they feel very positively, such as a mother or a father&quot; - said the psychologist.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
&quot;The exercise of faith should and in many cases really does change our personality&quot; - added Wright.
After these formidable results, only one question remains: what effect would it have on pain regulation if the faithful were shown the Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of his stature?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On its tenth birthday, Google can affirm: it can be found both in people&#39;s pockets and in the sky above their heads; you know where they spent their vacations, which doctors they visit and what interests them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company&#39;s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, the skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times newspaper that Google&#39;s primary goal is to gather as much personal data about its users as possible, and this is necessary in order to meet the original goals of Google&#39;s founders: &quot;Let&#39;s gather in one system! all the information in the world! &quot;.
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that turned the world upside down is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question that what is going to happen in five years, Schmidt answered like this: I wish Google could answer questions such as &quot;What to do tomorrow?&quot; or &quot;What would be the best job for me?&quot; - however, the software will not be able to answer apparently so simple questions as long as there is not enough information from the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that while browsing the Internet, the searched keywords, the IP addresses and the pages to which they went at the end of the search are stored with precision.
Thanks, for example, to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can return to consult what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history it will generate much more personalized searches -in this same logic, will base the Recommendations, in which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned seeing Google&#39;s information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that not only do they keep, but in justifiable cases they also transfer all the expressions sought to third parties, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example in recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information from its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users who care about people&#39;s rights, in the month of May were relieved when the company together with the EFF, organization for the defense of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated in court that it was right in its litigation with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google cannot be forced, through any of the points of the constitution, to supply any type of information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to obtain, under the pretext of reinforcing the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and some thousand search phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor Nor are the full lists of web pages and keywords for the last two months.)
Thus, the opinion about Google is quite contradictory: those who fear providing their personal data criticize it because they think that their privacy, their private life is harmed by starting to use Google services, and they rebel against it as well as against multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the North American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, Internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the &quot;vanguard corporation&quot;, not their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the World , no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code or money for their applications, the code is open and the free program package is constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than practice. from the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks see with precision the very problematic relationship between people&#39;s rights and the Internet, which was produced precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then they can include them in a monitoring system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasa automatically appear.
We can know many cases from which it is clear that, for example, the girlfriend, when seeing the flow of photographs the next morning of mutual friends, finds out with whom her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night before or they can fire a company employee because He writes his honest opinion on his blog about the direction of the company: one thing is for sure, the definition of privacy has been completely revalued.
The &quot;online&quot; life of a person is what he shows of himself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of the youth of our days.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least tries to avoid Google&#39;s monopoly, can do so (starting for example with Scroogle that uses the Google search system, but leaves no traces).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to avoid being found, but Google&#39;s &quot;on-line&quot; applications, from text writing software to image and news reading applications, can be replaced with alternative versions which do not connect with gigantic servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion is almost openly waiting for the day when Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the surfaces of AdWords / AdSense advertising threatens the revenue of advertising agencies, while services that are being introduced more and more quickly cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for numerous other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, the top management flatly rejected the employee&#39;s protest after doubling the price of the company&#39;s daycare, they considered the unlimited number of feeding of the employees too expensive, but All this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to pressure from the Chinese government and the company, according to the agreement, leaked all information that violated good morals and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is ready to go, what is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to stir the world: while Some believe that Google&#39;s book and magazine scanning and archiving project will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be cited by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear its Health system, because in it we can create our own health profile complete, with previous analyzes, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, may provide a good raw material for writers of science fiction works, Scroogled, a novel by the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in an Orwellian way that future, in which a man from only Google data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to erase the tracks of the perpetrator of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
The police questioned two minors about Ózd&#39;s double murder who, according to well-founded suspicions, helped to erase the traces of the crime - said the spokesman for the Borsod province General Public Order Police on Tuesday.
The young women recognized the crime they were charged with, and are currently being accused of perpetrators of the crime.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The defendant in Ózd&#39;s double murder - a 23-year-old man - has been in preventive detention since Sunday.
He is accused of the crime of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday of last week he summoned his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then also killed the victim&#39;s 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared much earlier to perpetrate the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the scene of the crime.
The police analyze the weapon and the circumstances of its use with an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange from the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which in a few months wishes to sell 60% of the shares.
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the offer from Poles was the highest among those offered by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have offered offers.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange declared last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that with this, in the future the Stock Exchange of Prague
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders&#39; agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Banco Ceská Sporitelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. arl with 13.5 percent. hundred.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the deepening international financial crisis speak of a &quot;second September 11&quot;.
The global financial catastrophe is due to the US president - believes The Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the hastily made bill, whose objective is to solve this desperate situation. ..
Instead of a new &quot;Pearl Habor&quot;, of which the billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke, it is more correct to speak of a &quot;second September 11&quot;.
According to some of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo&#39;s opinion, it was the error of the United States&#39; political leadership that brought the world economy to the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system grows more and more and this will later have repercussions throughout the world.
Although Bush&#39;s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in midair - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored - notes the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still throw a lifebelt on failing financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayer money.
But if, as I dominate them, the bank collapses even more, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough anymore.
In the long term, the member states of the European Union need to put aside their nationalistic selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that concerns are becoming more and more real that, just as the North Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
Until now, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis that is passing like a cúme in the Old Continent.
The &quot;saviors&quot; will not have to immediately present hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be nice if they defined: in which cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car mimics the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method to develop collision avoidance technologies, if not by mimicking nature&#39;s existing obstacle sensors?
For example that of the bumblebees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebees provided the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-mimicking BR23C robotic car steering system, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions. .
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our protective safety capsule - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, director of technology for PR and research and development, at the exhibition.
An important role is played by the compound eyes of bumblebees, which are capable of seeing in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of compound eyes, the engineers used the laser length measurement system.
It identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle&#39;s microprocessor which immediately transforms into a collision avoidance maneuver.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle, imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by turning the wheels as necessary.
Unlike any existing system today, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
&quot;If this were not the case, the vehicle robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles&quot; - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
You must react immediately and instinctively, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the protective safety capsule, in a layer within which all kinds of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to avoid other bumblebees.
This process should be done in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed up, down or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bumblebees to avoid other bumblebees, here they only used rotary movement and acceleration as a possibility for the car robot, as well as braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means that they have a longer life than lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the capacity of data processing, much less the storage capacity.
This device in each second only has to process some input signals and react according to the case.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with instinctive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, thus using only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
Gigabyte or megabyte memory is not required.
This is the first step in developing the technology to avoid obstacles immediately, which according to Nissan estimates, within ten years will be able to be incorporated into series-produced models.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding existing obstacles on his way.
This very expensive child already has a name
The written version of the law of the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars has been prepared and will be applied in several phases in order to buy bad loans from banks.
In the first phase, half the money will be spent.
According to East Coast hours, during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, the leaders of the congress reached an agreement on the financial rescue package of 700 billion dollars in total, after several days of discussion. - reported Reuters.
We have achieved important progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the North American Congress, affirming that it only remains to formalize the agreement in a document.
The compromise made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking on the outcome of the compromise stated: this program will work and be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it&#39;s not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy bandwagon.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, that is, on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (that is, before 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European time ), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the bill called the emergency law for economic stabilization of 2008, the North American Congress will vote first on Monday and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - stated Tony Fratto, the White House spokesman.
The program is different from the Bush administration&#39;s original proposal to spend the entire $ 700 billion to buy shoddy credit fund securities.
Now only half of the 700 billion dollars can be spent, using 250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy securities of credit fund, poorly rated and the fate of another $ 100 billion depends on the president&#39;s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the chairman of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the 700 billion dollars will be able to be spent after a new decision by Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and credit fund securities, in addition to other &quot;poisonous&quot; type credits as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or directly - informed competent persons from the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson affirmed: the law ensures the necessary financial means in such a way that it can even reach 700 billion dollars to satisfy the urgent needs of the American financial system, be it the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could cause the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks that are in distress and await the help of the State will be able to count on the official limitation of their indemnities, which the American slang simply calls a golden parachute.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, in addition the limitations depend on the form of help from the finance ministry.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys at auction, an extra tax will be levied on the gold parachutes, unless the failed bank boss retires.
By buying bad loans outright, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that boss payoffs are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, the existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations refer only to the new contracts to stimulate participation in the program.
This is the first case in North American history that a legal limitation will be in force on the income of general directors - said the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Congressional committee, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since ultimately they will even be able to obtain profits with the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
According to the bill, in the next five years the president must present to Congress a proposal on how to return financial sector losses to taxpayers.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed reservations about the project.
This is not what the American citizens entrusted to us, that is, they are not protecting taxpayer dollars - declared the Republican Congressman from California, Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democrat colleague Mary Kaptur said: the measures were urged by the very people who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for the North American-Hungarian agreement on the exemption of visas to come into force around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarians residing there.
In his opinion, &quot;practically everything depends on the electronic access and control system being built on the other side of the Atlantic in time.&quot;
At the same time, he warned that the entry permit will disappear in the new system, but tourists must register before leaving the country of origin.
As of today, the Hungarian head of diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, presenting her with the Medium Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. .
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the financial rescue package for the banks.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major North American parties, assured on Sunday their support for the administration&#39;s $ 700 million bank aid program, while there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Finance Minister.
The representatives of the Congress and of the administration, after negotiations of several days of marathon type, in the early hours of Sunday announced: an agreement of principles was reached on the financial rescue package of the banks.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and unfreezing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, when economic issues came to the fore, Obama again gained a certain advantage and the McCain advantage that he had obtained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin&#39;s candidacy for vice presidency disappeared.
At a Detroit campaign rally on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass the bill on the $ 700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal includes those points of consumer protection, which he himself supported.
&quot;We have to act now and responsibly (...) your jobs, your savings, as well as entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are in danger&quot; - he told a crowd of 35 thousand people.
He did not miss the occasion to call McCain&#39;s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain explained that &quot;we will all swallow this with great difficulty (...) but doing nothing is simply not a viable path.&quot;
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission for the minister of fines and the limitation of compensation for executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain played no major role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister daily.
Congressional Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that congressmen will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
German-speaking area press review
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscientious voters became - says Der Spiegel about the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled &quot;The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents&quot; he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken office.
The Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who are turning their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem for the entire Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
The failure was not totally surprising for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that had been anticipated for almost ten years ended: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU scored 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the Bundestag elections of 2005, that is to say even during the much mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the province devouring its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were very wrong in their timing. However, secularization, the results of education and the settlement of North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
With modernization the possibilities are also increased and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscientious, critical and stubborn voters became.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks it was precisely the mainstream groups of citizens who were the ones who moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those with a high school diploma and the graduates.
Thus, support for the CSU was reduced to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily: &quot;Who with whom? In its article&quot; Party chairmen are very reserved on coalition issues &quot;- deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from meddling in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, the greens on the other hand do not yet want to consult on the coalition.
Elections have already been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders barely let any of their decks be seen.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the position of vice chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Schüssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
He said cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to meddle in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must be discussed without any doubt, within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
&quot;To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility from the government&quot; - said Haider.
Járóka: We must break the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities began in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also the current president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, member of the European People&#39;s Party for Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers at this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that Gypsy children are flogged and it is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organizations for the protection of social rights attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press bureau of the group of Fidesz deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labor market in the first place due to their low level of education.
&quot;Most of the young Roma have not finished high school and due to the poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant part can obtain a university diploma.&quot;
Járóka also highlighted that education, as a fundamental human right, has a determining role in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investing in teaching Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to widely raise awareness of these issues both among Roma and non-Roma.
For the earlier a gypsy student starts school, the more chances he or she will have to become an active member of the labor market; Through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
&quot;For Roma, as citizens of the European Union, we must ensure the right to quality education and guarantee the abolition of segregated and low-level education&quot; - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to immediately accelerate the processes of school desegregation, for that the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
&quot;We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights&quot; - demanded Járóka.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized annually since last year&#39;s Berlin meeting held in the sign of the &quot;European Year of Equal Opportunities&quot;, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at the European level and at the national level of the Member States.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies, when viewing drug purchase data, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
&quot;There are programs for the protection of personal data, which to the use of the data of the prescriptions in all cases is linked to the approval of the given person.
It must be in independent hands, because if not, &quot;we entrust the chicken coop to the fox&quot; - the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, designer of the program to monitor prescriptions.
Insurance companies make the price of the insurance and the amount of compensation dependent on the client&#39;s state of health and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent the client to a medical check-up and signed the contract with him, knowing the result of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer&#39;s identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies the list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the diseases and state of health of the patient. client.
For example, if you consistently take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that the level of fat in your blood is practically incurably high, thus you are immediately placed in a higher risk category.
Numerous versions of the program circulate, some even establish a risk number, so that the insurance company in addition to the administration hardly has anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is, for example, that some medications are multipurpose, for example certain substances are used both to treat headaches and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-increasing factor for insurance companies while the former are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process these data, which, before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, request the approval of the patient.
The authorities already force them to do this, although they have not received a fine for negligence so far.
Some companies lately also prepare the results of laboratory tests and combining them with data on drug consumption obtain more accurate information on the patient&#39;s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those that provide health services.
The bill that provides the right to the authority to control specialized companies for the supply of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that said person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the good will of the fox.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision will be made at the end of October on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the top of the Bavarian CSU, for the moment the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party&#39;s extraordinary congress to be held the last weekend in October.
The members of the much criticized duo hinted: they do not cling so much to their positions.
They were trying to reassure the angry members of their parliamentary group and grassroots organization, who one day after the &quot;Bavarian tsunami&quot; demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the peak of his career - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43, 4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had a &quot;monopoly&quot; in Bavaria that accounts for 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, the conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will no doubt have to form a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party&#39;s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber&#39;s possible successors, also has a seat in the small intelligence group that begins negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Free Voters of right about a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that Gabriele Pauli enters parliament on the list of Free Electors, whose performance against Stoiber was used for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly erased from the stage ambitious local politics.
The top leaders of the CSU are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also receive an active role, who until now has been moving the strings in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU described September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and for Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to jointly elevate the CSU that played a pivotal role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could barely hide her disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which of course is relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko&#39;s opposition: 110-0
After Sunday&#39;s elections, there will be no opposition MP in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexandr Lukashenko guarantees in the country, on the other hand, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained more by violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral result.
Although the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, made up of one hundred and ten deputies, has been without opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday&#39;s elections the opposition united under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) expected that Lukashenko , which for the fourth time renewed its mandate after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a consequence of the modification of the Constitution, this time it would &quot;allow&quot; the entry of some opposition deputies into parliament.
Thus the ODSZ abolished the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the opposition&#39;s expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took a loan to moderate the increasingly expensive import of natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale of Beltransgaz to Russia. , owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - he wanted to improve his relations with the European Union, which does not give Lukashenko and other high-level politicians entry permission for having a political regime considered undemocratic.
It was a sign of détente when the OSCE, when evaluating the electoral campaign, placed emphasis rather on positive phenomena and not on errors - such as the ban on participation imposed on a third of opposition candidates.
Yet Monday&#39;s primary OSCE report criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates were unable to appear in the press - and especially that the opposition was unable to be present at the vote count.
With all this, in the opinion of the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is felt: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus is theoretically a federal state - has already considered the two regions independent for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has started - he told our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that &quot;the regime is afraid to allow even one opponent to enter that weightless parliament.&quot;
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations upon seeing the results, rather it tries to convey its message to the voters about the need for economic reforms.
- This of course causes us many problems because we have to print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties before its distribution, but even so I see that more and more support the change among the elderly as well - said Milinkevich , alluding to the fact that the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, is not considered adequate even by retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the decomposition of social security that &quot;resembles the silence of cemeteries&quot; - said Milinkevich.
Russian observers, contrary to the opposition politician, called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: &quot;People do not believe in words but in deeds&quot;, so the lack of opposition is nothing more than the testimony of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Marseille Global Menu
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are reciprocal trading partners, this issue in addition to the other mostly global issues dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly to deal with cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great developing democratic power that should have more voice and vote in international affairs but the member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been discussed at the ninth summit that started yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana Principal Representative of Foreign Policy, received Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India with whom they reached an agreement to duplicate in five years, that is to say to increase to more than one hundred thousand million euros, its commercial exchange.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
Thus they legally harmonized the twenty-six existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so that air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India&#39;s leading trading partner, New Delhi is only ranked 9th among the Union&#39;s trading partners.
The summit turned its attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism - all forms of the latter - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pushed for, although both sides bear great responsibility for its failure.
The EU confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate program, that is, until 2020 it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least twenty percent.
India also agrees with this, as at next year&#39;s climate conference a global agreement should be reached and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wish to hinder the increase in food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - in a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to information from the news agency, the agreement would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international book show in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international book exhibition in Frankfurt expects for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 102 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as the guest of honor.
It will be the undersecretary of the Ministry of cultural goods and activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
An encounter with the stamp will follow in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present numbers, trends and prospects on the state of publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors decreases progressively over the total of Italian production, and in particular that for adults and adolescents.
Brunetta: &quot;From now on you have breakfast before starting work&quot;
It has never happened in the history of Palacio Chigi that automatic doors were installed to control the entry and exit of personnel.
But as of today, this measure begins against whoever signs up and then goes to the bar to have a coffee during working hours.
This novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
&quot;Automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services,&quot; says the minister.
&quot;Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opening.
This is Reformism, &quot;Brunetta emphasizes again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council is completed.
For Masi &quot;the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view&quot;.
No resistance has been encountered from the employees, says the general secretary: &quot;It has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration from them.&quot;
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta&#39;s word, which suggests, smiling, &quot;a good cappuccino at 7 in the morning is a holy hand.&quot;
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
from Rome, the minister declares that &quot;in three months the sickness absences of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is to say 60 thousand more people to work in a year.&quot;
And he adds that it is necessary to render the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, &quot;which wage dynamics - explains the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and well above the rate of inflation&quot;.
For now millions of public employees have joined to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
&quot;While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the lowest absenteeism from work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of &#39;lazy workers&#39; is continuously increasing.
Millions of correct and productive civil service employees in Italy have come together to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree. &quot;
In particular, the Tar will answer the exclusion of economic treatments added for illness due to service; the extension of the time bands in which the sick employee&#39;s medical control visits are made, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Work accidents, Napolitano: &quot;Crucial prevention&quot;
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, the Inail data effectively confirms that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice the number of deaths compared to homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the Italian provinces the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday in October .
&quot;The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,&quot; says the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, National Association mutilated and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of State expresses his &quot;great appreciation for the constant associative effort in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and the awareness of public opinion &quot;.
&quot;It has been manifested, a &#39;enough&#39;, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, on the other hand, daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamic&quot;.
Napolitano does not hide that &quot;there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is taken by the numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness of the young people who enter the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about the social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
For his part, the president of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has underlined &quot;how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each one of us and imposes on all the institutions a determined effort to urgently put an end to it.&quot;
&quot;The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not mean that the number of white deaths is equally impressive,&quot; remarked the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
&quot;We do not want, indeed, that this&quot; tendency to diminish &quot;is translated in less attention, because it is exactly when the attention diminishes that the tragedy explodes.
&quot;We believe that at a general level too little is still being done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli has highlighted - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of schools &quot;.
&quot;A further effort is useful - he added - as far as communication and public awareness are concerned.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency &quot;.
Mercandelli has denounced &quot;the progressive deterioration in the level of subsidiary protection provided for victims of work&quot; and the &quot;referral towards which the system has been moving in recent years&quot;.
&quot;The objective is to restore the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who have an accident does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time.&quot;
Mp3 players under accusation, put hearing at risk
Listening to music at high volume for a long period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission refers to, which in a statement released in Bruxel cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
&quot;From this scientific opinion - it reads in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than one hour a day having the device at high volume risks permanent hearing loss &quot;.
&quot;I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high acoustic levels may unconsciously ruin their ears irretrievably,&quot; says Meglena Kuneva.
&quot;From the scientific evidence - the EU responsibility follows - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and render this information in the public domain.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems in light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and keep up with the new technology. &quot;
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that this originates.
&quot;Scientists - concludes the EU executive - confirm that it is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine together with member states and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related devices &quot;.
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as the hearing damage that can derive from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to greatly limit this damage by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and the time of exposure to noise.
In his opinion, the Ue Scientific Committee points out that users of portable musical devices listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week, they exceed the limit currently in force regarding the maximum noise allowed in the position. of work.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the &quot;Commission for the future of the capital of Rome&quot;, which was established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will deliberate the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyzes and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the &quot;official bun&quot; of the Municipality and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
&quot;The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - Alemanno tends to emphasize - It must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, can later endorse themselves. .
There is no excess role position, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, when the works are finished, it will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporal end.
In June - announces the mayor - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome &quot;.
To whom the Commission accuses of being useless, given that its opinions are not binding, Alemanno responds: &quot;It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of its proposals.
If quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Politics is almost always squashed in ordinary management and in emergencies that manifest themselves again and again.
On the contrary, we want to look further and in the long term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future &quot;.
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that &quot;this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost Roman citizens one euro and it will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital expresses.&quot;
For Alemanno, indeed, &quot;it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap in level, of which we absolutely need, thinking with a united spirit of its future&quot;.
A future that, the mayor of Rome points out, &quot;will not be limited only to the current communal confines but will look beyond&quot; not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but &quot;also considering the role that Rome it can and must develop as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean &quot;.
Obama? The first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in passing as an independent: &quot;Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and had relations (as he also does today with private citizens) with the enemy Islam &quot;.
Attacks on Obama increase as election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: &quot;This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he thinks he will win the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators! &quot;
They are actually attacks that don&#39;t say much; They are attacks clearly of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there is someone who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in the Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the voting booth we will know well who the American patriot will give his vote to.
One side of the American mentality has been covered until the last.
&quot;Say what you want, we will think later where to put the cross, if on Obama or on McCain.&quot;
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before now, that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was kicked home from behind.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Equally, Iraq for the majority has been Bush&#39;s weak point.
Whoever will take over from George W will have an enormous duty to perform.
Usa, the economic collapse is also being felt for journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, the &quot;killer&quot; of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Although, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don&#39;t feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails over the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses carve a gap on the Internet, for many seen as the &quot;killer&quot; of the printed letter.
The &quot;economic pressure&quot; that journalists are warning has risen to 79%.
All 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope &quot;that it will do some good&quot; for journalism.
The biggest break in American journalism today is between who runs the newspapers - that is, the editors - and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some this has to do with &quot;job security&quot;.
Executives who think they will lose their job in 3 years are 47% nationwide.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The &quot;safe work&quot; at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In a huge nation like the US, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and it thus becomes a matter of &quot;take it or leave it&quot;.
Directors almost always receive good salaries, while writers can earn up to $ 10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to arrive at 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, &quot;get sick&quot; often throughout the year.
It&#39;s all a matter of weather.
UNIPOL: COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the field of the investigation into the counter-pact related to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process under his charge, last week, he obtained home release, transforming it into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent be able to travel the route from the provincial city to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The elites in danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the 700 million dollar salvation plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street to save the economy.
Yesterday&#39;s New York Times confirms that the current crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old soul of the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul On the other hand, conservative, hostile to &quot;those of Washington&quot; and to the world of finance, especially strong in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, in fact, that has become arrogant with the vote of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This just mentioned is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here only.
Both in the United States and in Europe, the crisis has long seemed to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that, with the new climate, solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in effect, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance which have, yes, strong financial relations with the exterior, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and the protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but it is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the game or they do not have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union, divided as always between the different interests and the different state strategies, cannot decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment the cut is reached, it is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which probably no market and no organization will ever be able to dispose of to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do the math every day. once again with the little immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, mind you, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever is sovereign, certainly has many more cards than who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a position without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second news that but heralds a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of inadequate relieved economic species with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the Western countries in increasing numbers.
It seems to advance always more, in different places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites until now on the rise, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the end. , to have made his own time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, manifested in an electoral &quot;revolt&quot; or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times. , from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Great Britain, to the rebellion of the American congressmen against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy, which has something to do with it).
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, some would say, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent what they are taking from today. form are the deep strata of western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and agitates potentially in excess.
In the face of all this, to speak of a &quot;mass rebellion&quot; today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn&#39;t.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like spider man.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to stick a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY - The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of the existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
&quot;The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,&quot; explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time &quot;it comes off easily from the walls&quot; explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALK THE WALLS? - &quot;This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive» adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk the walls exactly like spider man? Layers yes, but the researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electrical current.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also searching for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California scholars have presented an adhesive made of hair-like micro-fibers that self-clean dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time with some drugs, their absorption is altered, amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, the efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices being packaged that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicinal David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice was already under accusation because it was held responsible for increasing some antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological medicines to toxic levels.
DRUGS AT RISK - The same Italian drug agency had released the news in an information bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger derived from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drunk in the case of assuming a drug such as Diasepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the call from Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the State University of Milan: &quot;These discoveries in general are reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the informative notes of the same.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let ourselves be impressed, ask the doctor or pharmacist clearly, ”the expert from the Ansa agency stressed.
The Economics Novel to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration&#39;s decisions on the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the attack of September 11, 2001, in those days when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the United States. .
A forecast that sparked a lot of controversy and that for several years was reproached to the economy, but that has now been revealed to be accurate.
&quot;I am surprised and a little upset that the memory of the scandal of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom has quickly disappeared from public attention,&quot; Krugman had declared at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a &quot;economist of great value&quot;, but also a popularizer with a &quot;very aggressive style, particularly critical of the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration.&quot;
Open Office, echo the third edition of the &quot;anti-Microsoft&quot; package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that seeks to attract more and more users, from home to the office, to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year on the part of the volunteer developers, whose backs are watched by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: the welcome screen and the less rude magazine interface, other more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO standard version.
Attention also paid to the multi-functionality with the 2007 Office suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Some specific functions of some modules are interesting, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the graphic elaboration module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create &quot;hybrid PDF&quot; documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements inside the applications: in the spreadsheet, different users can intervene, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the I comment for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, above the clouds), and in the next few weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and was added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the subject of the free can be a hook for diffusion in homes, it is in the business environment that Open Office tests the suite, tries the big bet, being able to already count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And there is not even a lack of realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office is made up of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding Word video writing; Calc, is the spreadsheet that Excel replaces; Impress, for the Powerpoint presentation; Dbase, as in the case of the well-known Access, is the program that allows you to work in the data base; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that until today we have reached almost 3,600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure will be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third place and winner of the best climber&#39;s T-shirt.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L&#39;Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive third-generation Epo rider, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The tests on Kohl&#39;s blood champions are among those carried out in recent weeks at Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry&#39;s lab.
If the cross tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place to the Tour and will go against the two years of canonical disqualification.
Confirming the news of Kohl&#39;s positive doping to the third-generation Epo is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the news.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, winning the T-shirt for the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS, IS ITALY RACIST?
Italy as an emigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants &quot;received with hostility.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that it has dedicated to the debate on the issue of racism in Italy, based on the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was murdered the previous month in Milan for having stolen a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the &quot;northern paradox&quot;: the northern regions are at the same time those where there are &quot;more integration and more work&quot; but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most supportive top of the North league &quot;.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lega tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm of the change of climate in Italy.
Trend marked by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: &quot;Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedetto XVI in Congress has asked that the State and the church work together to combat racism.&quot;
Found the plane of Steve Fossett the millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, the millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, have been found.
The debris has been found on a plateau at 3,000 meters of altitude, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
the commissioner of Madera County, John Anderson, has dispelled the doubts that still remained: &quot;The plane has been located, we have sent a squad, and now we have the confirmation that it is typical of what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance &quot;has said in a stamp conference.
The commissioner has specified that no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surroundings.
The 63-year-old millionaire was presumed dead in February.
The American office for transport security (Ntsb) has made it known that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squad of investigators has been sent who has identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since 3 September in 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the border of Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents with Fossett&#39;s name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
The search for Fossett had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he had become the first Man to complete the turn of the world in a hot air balloon: two solitary weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the round of the world by plane and without stops.
Among his records, also that for having flown at 15,445 meters in height, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you don&#39;t expect
An off-the-charts Suv with an original and well-established design with sharp lines and set angles.
It is this, in short, Glk the last born among the &quot;compact&quot; off-road trucks from the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Due to its non-traditional content, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Glk suv will be unexpected and unconventional, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
The advertising campaign that will accompany the debut of the new car will launch an unprecedented form of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the central street of the Milanese shopping mall, Como avenue, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in a stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on Avenida Como, it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images you will have the impression that the car comes out of the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed into a single image.
Without a doubt Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will you be able to capture the interest of future buyers with this formula? we will see.
it&#39;s clear who the italian hooligan are
In the Triveneto, the prohibition of access to sports events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys of whom Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the &quot;Ultras Italia&quot; group that the Italian National has followed for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they had never met the rival&#39;s fans either.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these from Sofia have been added a small group (few units, actually) from the Campaign and from Apulia.
They have flags of three colors where the militants&#39; city of origin appears: Saturday night they have been removed so that they are not identified.
English fans are inspired.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets for the match available to the Italian fans: all already with the names, therefore easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those that had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had been prohibited from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have had their ticket and also the trip rejected.
Now the interior ministry hopes to read the acts that arrive from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or to whom has been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents frequenting not only Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Fortunately!.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others will be added.
&quot;We have to put out this fire immediately and not legitimize who behaves in this way,&quot; they maintain from the Ministry of the Interior.
Therefore, &quot;eyes wide open&quot; especially in view of Wednesday&#39;s National game in Lecce &quot;.
In Apulia there is also a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams that can also have a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, that is, the secret service, which deals with problems in stadiums itself.
&quot;The choirs of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria it is not a reato ...&quot;.
This is the thought (expressed in an unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (he has taken the position that before was Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been Trieste chief of public security where there is a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not unreasonable to celebrate the Duce, but the behavior of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
&quot;I am not a sociologist - adds No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes are attributed to the countries in which the event occurs.
Until now this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let&#39;s also talk about the whistles to Mameli&#39;s hymn: those too are not a reato, but if they allow they are not educational either ... &quot;.
Student victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants&#39; union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
&quot;The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study for a large part of young people due to the very high costs that the family would have to bear - explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani - in these cities, strong demand has totally deformed the market to the point of unleashing a generalized increase process even for residents. &quot;
Apart from the fact that in most cases the rental offers contain a series of violations: free type contracts, not registered, with no fee limit, linked sub-rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the review of the tax rate, can regulate prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) they ask you approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
Savings are made only if the peripheral area is changed: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in the Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed they serve you 300/450 euros, for a room it costs from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Polyclinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed they serve you 250/350 euro, at least 350 for a single.
in smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and non-community rents is more frequent, a further anomaly is registered: a 25/30% increase in the fee for foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic theaters
Historic cinemas close favoring Multiplexes.
&quot;A city without cinemas in a blind city is like a face without eyes.&quot;
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, a photographer, effectively shows what is happening in large Italian urban centers and also in provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono theaters in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime .
Almost always they are historical places, full of memory, to disappear, &quot;it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom one shared a piece of place and so much emotion&quot;, observes the director of the new Paradiso cinema, the film that twenty years ago cousin Oscar and the grand jury prize at Cannes won back, which told the poetry of a provincial movie theater and the nostalgia for the way of living the cinema that maybe lost forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed 316 traditional cinemas, and paying most of it are mainly theaters of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for its disappearance is the settlement of the multiplex, these three Italian regions are their own, which have registered the largest number of new meticones cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
&quot;The Italian exercise has developed irrationally&quot; observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, &quot;it would be useful if new structures were built but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its patrons are willing to be transferred to the meticones.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of the merchants: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view, that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector, it would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year ”.
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city to be concerned about closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect single theater cinema in the historic center than on the periphery.
Among the norms provided there are fiscal facilitation measures in favor of the managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the limited traffic zone and will have special rates for parking.
&quot;It is an initiative that I like,&quot; observes Giuseppe Tornatore &quot;and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna, putting other measures in place.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of the meticones, the traditional rooms have to improve the quality of the sound and the image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is an issue that was always important to me: the closure of the Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the &quot;New Paradiso Cinema&quot;, which I had already thought about for a long time. 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the closed Rialto or Quirinale de via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many shared emotions, so as not to see the posters blackened by dust, I turn to the other side ».
Ties between politics and &#39;ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
&quot;The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Piromalli cosca&quot;.
The accusations that the magistrates of the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate give the mayor and vice mayor of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his lawyer grandson, the boss&#39;s namesake, were also arrested, already convicted of a criminal mafia association and to compensate 10 million euros.
&quot;Disregarding any legal and moral norm, and of good sense,&quot; the attorneys write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to the lawyer Piromalli.
&quot;The mafia family would have been allowed - the judges write - to officially enter the interior of the municipality, facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.&quot;
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that &quot;agreements between organized bad life there are a lot&quot; in his region: &quot;There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist pressure from the &#39;ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean. &quot;
Those arrested this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the cutting of heads of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and the local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of managing the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor, of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
I appeal to the vice minister of the interior, who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even asked for the variation of the project of highway A3.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, there emerges &quot;the willingness to favor the demands of a businessman, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, standardizing the elections of the public administration on the interests of the mafia families&quot; .
When the energy is born from the waves, the greats take the stage
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet&#39;s surface and is being discovered now by the great world energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the greats like Chevron look.
The possibility of collecting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s together with the first oil crisis, investigations were intensified.
When the price of oil fell in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now that the environmental issues and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world&#39;s electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of ocean waves.
This amount would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And then there would be the currents and the tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an implant in the North of Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy there are always more and among these companies those who have always voted for traditional energy.
&quot;Chevron is studying the technology on ocean energy - has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the US oil giant to the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us&quot;.
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permit from the US energy commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is quite an important sign, considering that the US continues to extract oil in Alaska and recently President Bush has activated a plan to drill further.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy that comes from the sea, the total invested so far, although they are not detailed, indicate a growing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts speak of a technology still at the beginning, because there is no doubt that marine energy has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those Portuguese or Scottish are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a higher environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of boas joined together.
The force of the waves, which makes the boas move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure turns a turbine which in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through undersea cables.
For now, there are four implants of this type in development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, it could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping center and for a parking lot, using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that powers the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say in the Institute for the development of electrical energy, merits at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tides are more preventable than the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that approach the coasts, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for the 2009.
