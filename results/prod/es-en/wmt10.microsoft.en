Barack Obama to be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and check will be greeted, inter alia, by exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time you will meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected you between 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple planned a meeting with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon the visit will culminate in a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, even if the third president receives it in his office.
The White House has already announced that by receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which he doesn't forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
It is proposed to donate them charitable purposes, but it has not yet decided which particular organization.
During their full programme, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the prime minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the award.
He mentioned, for example, the feeling that he did not deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Nature defender accused of blackmail
The police in Litom-ice accused the president of the civic association Spole-nost ochránc-p-írody Litom-ice (Society of Nature Defenders Litom-ice) blackmail.
Last year she appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw appeals demanded money from investors for her own benefit, litomice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Society of Nature Dedefensors Litom-ice is Lubomír Studni-ka.
He is currently under arrest and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn't like containers too much to separate trash
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia you can find containers to separate rubbish everywhere.
What about Brno?
There it takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don't want to say that in Brno the garbage doesn't separate at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the town halls are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of rubbish, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET in the center to the right container?
It's almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I've found so far is in Moravské námstí Square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Don't be angry with me Mr. Onderka and his companions, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to mention, elsewhere it's not easy to separate trash either.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
Out of vagrancy
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I myself offered, after a party, to throw away several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Luckily, going to the tram, I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already overflowing with the container.
It's still the center of Brno, the most representative part of town, isn't it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics don't seem too interested in Brno's Socialists.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraleague, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is truly the worst in the entire Jihomoravska kraj region.
"Paroubek" budget took money from income and sickness subsidies
After the left, despite the government's view, added funds for farmers or civil servants, there may not be enough money in the budget for rent, sickness subsidies, or construction savings.
But not for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt everyone who rules in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and communists imposed the increase for some groups, they were committed to the government'sposteriority requesting a loan for sensitive expenses, income or sickness subsidies. "That means just putting the problems off for the future, it's laying mines," Janota says.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay ever higher interest and, someday, you have to pay back the money.
The state doesn't have much choice of getting money.
If you do not reduce social subsidies or state operating expenses, you have to increase taxes.
To all to those who added the left now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, also his children.
People don't have to worry about income or sickness subsidies, they'll get them. 1.8 billion disappeared from these accounts.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year, only 163 billion will be missing from the treasury, but more.
Despite Minister Janota's effort, debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer arrive by slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion to finish the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been concluded and where the construction process has already begun, the projects of which cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced either.
The most you can do is keep them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large buildings; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, warns Ministry of Transport spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
SSD proposed a solomonic solution for the decrease in funds: it will raise money from the dividends of the state-owned EEZ, and add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe or a bottomless sack.
Last year, 18 billion were allocated to the budget by EEZ.
Ecological damages are settled each year of dividends, served to complete the income account, or serve as a reserve for prepared income reform.
Moreover, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to award various compensation to victims of communism and crime, or to litigation costs, including in building savings.
It is unclear whether the State will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, Janota says.
The Minister will then have to save money within the spring or, at worst, take control of the government budget reserve.
There is also a hundred million left for the Státní pokladna (State Box) project, which is priced at two billion and has already been started. It should allow online monitoring of what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister doesn't find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With the push of a key, they happen in a few seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the objective of the US company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizing software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at once.
They will be able to switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and several days ago it was first demonstrated.
It will be released in 2012.
Smartphone virtualization is no longer any fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a RAM of 128 MB, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers throughout 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It's not just the ski lift maintainers in Krkono-e who care about snowless slopes.
The lack of snow means that people do not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That's why you can still get free rooms for all winter dates in Krkono-e, including Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the deals, check the prices, but they're still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they ask immediately about our opinion, whether there will be snow or mud this Christmas," said martin Jandura's Spindl.Info portal maintainer.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve on a New Year's Eve according to their expectations should no longer hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers in the city offer mostly weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they'll keep offering them, but soon they'll give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the spare rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a vrchlabí travel agency, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the places offered are still free.
That's why we've already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays," Ingtours director Petr Schiefert said.
Vrchlabí's travel agency can still also offer New Year's Eve in Krkono-e, but there are fewer vacanties.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year interest in winter stays is damaged by the lack of snow in Krkono-e.
People are waiting to see if there'll be snow.
Nobody wants to spend new Year's Eve on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will run out too," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Snokou; last year was harder.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," reported the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays are also occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázna.
On the contrary, at the most recent hotel in Janské Lázna at Christmas, half the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise to us, as we are about sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkono-e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that the hoteliers in Krkono-e will be looking forward to snow waiting.
Temperatures must drop on Thursday and, if there is precipitation, the mountains should snow.
But then again the temperatures will rise, said Hradec Králové's Jisí Jakubsk, from the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his long-awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the same text used several times as "just like in Iraq," but it also failed to use the title of the January 2007 Bush statement for his own statement, "A New Road Forward."
It was himself, who three years ago criticized Bush's idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country suffering from civil war. And that criticized it as "an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful, so that today there is nothing talk of Iraq in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor a much more favorable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even in spite of traditional subordinate relationships, subjected the undecided riflemen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40, 000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he couldn't think of anything better, so he at least deceived the general about 10,000 military personnel.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing about Obama's entire strategy seems like his goal, start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and completing this procedure in three years. Obama's entire doctrine generated more questions than the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
Political institutions, while formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin. Patriarchal tribal relations will remain behind him.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relationships, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum target of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama's strategy clashes with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to erupt.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "return home soon," will perform some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of troop withdrawal is pure irresponsible, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect statement of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the U.S. will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
Answers will need to be sought precisely when, according to Obama, America initiates the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution like this will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential election is three years away, and that's why there's still plenty of time to find another strategy, if it's a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will never receive cash bonuses again
Senior executives at US bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior managers will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum period of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to link bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest path to take, said former bank investor of JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs bank faced criticism after nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK$300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total sum of bonuses at the entity for this year, according to the Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $20 billion.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced Wednesday that it plans to tax in one go, with a tax of fifty per cent, bonuses for bankers over 25,000 pounds (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record figure, today received in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden this year's Nobel Prizes, in specialized categories and literature.
In addition to the four scientists, she was among the award-winning also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Muller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was received by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel prize in chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last prize, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by American Elinor Ostrom and compatriot Oliver Williamson for analyzing an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each winner collected the diploma, Nobel medal and certificate of money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million Czech kronor).
In the case of several winners in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel, the Peace Prize, was received today afternoon in Oslo, Norway, US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of being awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive on Friday morning The Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is planning his tenure in government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps also Janota's tenure in the cabinet, is supposed to be the themes of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
President Radim Ochvat's spokesman reported on the appointment.
On his tenure at the show, Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the left's proposals for transfers of funds and increased money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the social democrats' proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on one side and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of domestic policy. Because of this conflict, future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, the form of which was agreed in the spring by the SDP, SSD and the Green Party, are beginning to be controversial.
Critics say that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of thrifty measures, imposed in the autumn by Fischer's government to curb public indebtedness.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the state budget law; today he stated at breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians had long neglected "the serious problem," i.e. "the unsus sustainable deficit" of public finances.
According to him today they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can rely on a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president says.
SMER leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is appalling and that the government should think about its future existence.
The vice-president of the STO, Petr Necaas, said to TK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the SSD, SDP and the Greens evidently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
The head of the SSD, Jií Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by former Topolánek government. It will exceed 200 billion kronor.
On Wednesday, SSD said the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The popular ones were happy too.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some reviews say that the starring roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the boxing world Milion Dollar Baby, played the role of the movement leader for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, the fictional president of the United States, and even God in Evan Almighty. But he rarely represented someone who is still alive and, to many people, is as important as Mandela.
The former South African stateist spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong to the outsiders in the global measure.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story into theaters.
I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close as possible to reality," Freeman said.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I discovered that by squeezing his hand, I get his energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Francois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players dominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough rugby world.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally first met Pienaar at home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar in my life was: "In the film I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of the director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his review with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of splendour over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
Russia's Ministry of Defence ended up recognizing yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested a ballistic intercontinental missile.
The launch failed again. The "Bulava" missile, formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimír Putin.
Even his repeated presence in missile testing has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavah, in most cases, did not fly out or an air failure occurred.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulavá" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problems occurred at first.
At the end of the flight, technical problems occurred again in the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a boat that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulavá".
The Norwegians the same from the outing point did not hesitate that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that you can't just talk about a failure.
The first two stages of the missile lasted and the breakdown occurred in the third.
In previous cases the engines broke down immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely error-free, according to the management of the Ministry of Defense only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of nearly fifty percent is full of optimism to the generals and that's why they continue to claim that "Bulavá" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will run again at the age of 51 for a professional hockey match.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play Friday in khL's match against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was wounded, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov practices constantly and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to settle some formal matters, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP if Fetisov returns to the ice rinks, he will become the longest-running professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary striker Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, throughout the season, and achieved 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canadian Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes at the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Glory.
Hyundai met the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all supplementary work
The management of the car factory in Noovice agreed with the trade unions to cancel all the supplementary work.
Precisely because of frequent additional work, the unions declared the strike emergency on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vanak, the spokesman for the Hyundai auto factory.
Management, however, wants to agree with the unions for another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary work by Saturday, December 19, i.e. two shifts will be worked on, Vank said.
According to the Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to employees working Saturday's shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaaka, the company decided to change the way its employees are motivated by the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend The Christmas holidays in one day, Vank said.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and for the meal.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point in the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Vank said.
Employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted virtually every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the trade unionists must take place on Monday morning.
The head of the Petr Kucha syndicates said Wednesday that if they committed to meet the requirements and signed the document, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the car factory was aggravated last week on Wednesday, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for frequent additional work.
They also protested against poor pay terms and alleged harassment.
Management believed that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
Trade unionists in their statement of Monday's strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, who interrupted manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
With regard to supplementary work, trade unions require the company to minised it.
In addition, this year requires a remuneration of 5,000 kronor for this job.
The car factory in Noovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial manufacturing began last November.
Until last September it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'silenced' HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs already accessible.
AIDS disease can't be cured until now.
However, patients' lives can be significantly prolonged by a mixture of medicines that prevent replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If virus replication is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the drugs no longer work.
The work of the experts of three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, V-CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metalocarborans have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are composed of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way from all drugs used today, which is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work scientists find new, 'enhanced' compounds, prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of their link to the albumin of the virus.
Metalocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyedr cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are bound by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resilient virus
HIV proteasis is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteasis, HIV virus fractionation does not occur and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV proteasis, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a number of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV proteasis was performed in specimen, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metalocarborans are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Eezáová, the head of the laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic and Biochemical Chemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics in the Academía.
Fight over the budget. SDO attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDP Chief Mirek Topolánek said next year's approved budget is "appalling" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should think about its future existence.
The SDP statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say there's time for analysis.
ODS Vice-President Petr Neca said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of SSD, SDP and the Green Party evidently no longer works.
According to Neas, the prime minister has to decide whether the Chamber of Deputies wants to rely on the minority, who is trying to combat the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of the SDP and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Necaas warned.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the 2010 budget, however with the left's proposed amendments, for more than 12 billion kronor.
The Chamber of Deputies increased money for the salaries of state officials, for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the SDP proposals as they coverly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion kronor.
SDS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the government's wish that the amended budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and futility
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will re-evaluate the current situation.
He is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened resignation in the event of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out, he's thinking of staying in the show.
The reason is his disappointment at the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another struggle against the budget deficit, according to Necaas in government, they have nothing to do with those nominated by the SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, whether the chamber approves other deficit-increasing laws, such as those referring to sickness subsidies, income, or the amendment to the service law.
Topolánek: SDP-nominated ministers are not to blame
It's the business of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
SDP-nominated ministers have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the positions of lieutenants there were people belonging to THE TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
He stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it rests on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, you will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDP members.
I have not thought about that, when the time is right, I will take care of it, said to the journalists in the Chamber of Deputies The Minister of Defence Martin Barták, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of the SDP.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon went out to a European Council meeting in Brussels.
SDP ceded at prime minister's request
He stressed that the SDP on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask SDP Members to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he reacted to the question, if SDP does not care about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from the mandate, he knew that in the coming months it was mainly the Bolshevisation of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all that is positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new schedule of trains in D, fewer trains will run for almost the same fares
From 13 December on 13 December, some less-used fast and local trains will be cancelled or restricted and, on the contrary, some links will be reinforced.
The total extent of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule takes effect.
Most rates including the basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will be gained for example by the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, dráhy for this line will add a pendolino goal.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not run again to Bratislava.
On the Prague - Písek - Eeské Bud-jovice line, fewer fast trains will run, the Prague - Letohrad direct links will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight per cent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in and around Prague.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - Eeské Bud-jovice route and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - Eeské Bud-jovice line will be reduced to a few weekdays only.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It's about the 15th. Line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádracaí station.
The D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava, and the trains to the Uumperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
Please note that from 13 December travellers will not be travelling to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
This year's regional rail bill: 200 million more than before
Fast trains are commissioned and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, to cover so-called proveable losses Dráhy will receive four billion kronor in total next year, just like this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion kronor in total, and the state will help them with nearly three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local trains dohy have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always one year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that's why the prices of a large majority of tickets didn't go up.
Changes will occur only on one-day tickets - D Net and cheap eLyka internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card, the price of D Net will increase from 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price of eLyka will depend on the distance, until now there was the unique price of 160 kronor for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine armed people continue to detain more than 50 people, children were released
The armed have now abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines, including several primary school pupils and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 abducted.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in South Agusan Province.
They say approximately 19 armed people use the hostages as a living shield on the escape to the police.
Local negotiators are trying to arrange for the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed men belong to the New People's Navy (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police previously pursued the kidnappers due to violence, the cause of which was the settlement of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in Maguindanao province it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the 23rd massacre. November, related to the governor's election, there were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty, were arrested.
Muslim separatists also operate on Mindanao Island.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
RSA's story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora-en) is released in American cinemas, which captures a portion of the biography of former South African Republic President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the title role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Its full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela . He was born on the 18th. July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk's, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when preparations for the world championship in football are completed in the Republic of South Africa. At the same time, the media is shocked by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of starring roles by the "unre interesting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman however says, he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well to play it.
Many times I met Nelson Mandela in person, to - as they say - collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good, if through the movie we can remember Mandela's character and message.
It's a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. He portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first election presidential term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the lead also puts on the costume of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA won the World Cup at the time.
By entering the gram in the suit, which at RSA is regarded as almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white audience and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship will perhaps manage to help people unite and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
You will still see, if you improve the tense situation in the RSA.
White South Africans however are skeptical, as a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Brittany, said in a recent interview for LN.
The championship starts on the 11th. June 2010.
Lounsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of kronor
The fire has in the morning caught a transformer from the company Epes in a switch box near the village of Vakov in Lounsko.
According to Luká-Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters from the Stí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, however they later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company's spokestor, the breakdown does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million kronor, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire goes out.
According to Mandátová it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of the activity of Eps nothing similar happened, the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokestor of the company EEZ for northern Chequía, supplies of the electric current were not cut off, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. Epes psobí in the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, of the electric conduction of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It retains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy of the transmission system to the distribution system, and maintains the electric conduction of 4339 kilometers long.
Jansura to file a slander complaint with three hetmánes from SSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jansura today will file a slander complaint with three social democratic hetmánes.
It is michal Hasek from the Jihomoravska kraj region, Radko Martínek from Pardubick-kraj and olomouck-kraj hetmán Martin Tesa-ík.
He mentioned it in Twenty minutes in Radiournál.
Demand has to do with the company's efforts, maintaining regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with eeské dráhy.
All three hetmáns are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the raisins from the cake", however we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim, we are more expensive than Eeské dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of Eeské dráhy, which were set last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the Student Agency society, he said for Radio-urnál Jansura.
He mentioned at the same time having the tests of all regions. According to him, they have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
He considers this complaint for the continuation of Mr Jansura's media show, which serves as free publicity for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other hetmáns to do so as well.
I suppose, it will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion that Mr Jansura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses lying and false arguments, Haek said.
He announced last week that he would invest several million kronor in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures in the regions.
He told Radiournál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign would be conducted against co-corruption as such.
He started the campaign after the regions agreed with eeské dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the commissioning of approximately 150 billion kronor did not convene a shopkeeper.
Similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
He claims to have been threatened by a member of SSD, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't let him, we may lose our bus licenses.
He ran as an MP for SSD, I know, what lord it is, I'm not going to say his name, Jansura said today for Radio-Urnál.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococal vaccine from January will put an end to the usual customs.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, opinions already appear that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are complete.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also already clear about the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
Children born since 2 August last year will be able to receive the pneumococal vaccine free of charge from January.
The condition is not to have received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier need to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth months of age as a child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily let their children be vaccinated against pneumococcals.
Parents however paid for a dose of 1600 kronor and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate younger children.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend on vaccines of 300 to 450 thousand kronor annually.
However they will save on treatment, which is needed for un vaccinated children.
So far the state has spent approximately 500 thousand annually on all vaccination of children.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and sepsis.
From pneumococal infections in our country every year 28 children not over the age of 10 die according to hospital research.
In addition to the Czech Republic, pneumocal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be mandatory?
However, at the same time opinions appear, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January it must be covered by insurance companies and volunteer.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, for example Rudolf Kalovsk, the head of the civic association Nahlas, said.
Its association has long spread pneumococal vaccines.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand we are happy, to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovsk mentioned.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination procedure.
At this time we don't think about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr.
Voluntary vaccine has its downsides, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians Odborná spole-nost praktick-ch d-tsk-ch léka-Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children would receive the vaccine, it may be reasoned about reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," Cabrnochová says.
Experts hope that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies be vaccinated against pneumococcals.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, and then save on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about buying vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "take money out of health insurance."
Doctors will therefore have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid for by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40 thousand per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, Cabrnochová says.
The son of an American artist involved "in the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million U.S. dollars (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta Sr., 81, is famous for his depiction of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police officer claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta Jr., 52, told police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta Sr. denied granting such permission.
Labour party defends tax increases in budget
Ministers defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "wasted" an opportunity to show his seriousness about deficit cuts, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% cap on public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Cholera for Social Security
Unions have lamented that low-wage workers are punished by a recession generated by others, and warned of future "problems."
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by about three billion pounds per year, has infuriated the business community, which claims that this is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase from April 2011
Economy to contract more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonds
The 1 point increase in corporation tax for small firms was derailed
Tax breaks for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the estimates of the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns £30,000 will lose £90 a year and whoever earns £40,000 will lose £190, while a person who earns £10,000 per year will win £110.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions," but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that fiscal rises and spending cuts outlined were a "grain of sand in the desert" compared to what was needed.
"These are big numbers. It will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour party's forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to borrow and how quickly the deficit is reduced, have been called into question after the Minister of Finance was forced to change the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy was likely to contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while the loan order would be £3 billion above previously estimated.
"Opportunity wasted"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party's "debt crisis," said that the projection of loan applications for £789 billion for the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, dodging "cynically" the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Shadow Minister of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had a chance to do it and they've wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour party insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek further short-term deficit reduction.
But Liberal Democrats said the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like "sand castles."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcements, such as rising inflation from some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the Minister of Finance exposed to accusations of electoral maneuvering, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour party insists that people are being provided more need it and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that adjusting public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence in the future.
"This is really putting the pain off for later," said its director, Robert Chote.
"All major announcements will come after the election, whoever wins," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant for Deloitte accountants.
"This was the false pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
FBI investigation into "arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
Pakistan's US embassy told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it's investigating whether they're the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, USA, last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about men.
Three of them are reportedly of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
"If you're American citizens, of course we're going to be very interested in the charges for which you've been arrested and what kind of circumstances you're being held back in," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the sights of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on arrests, Reuters news agency reported; but he said the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorism infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people."
Families of the five students reported her missing in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian "abuses"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been just as poor, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential election held in June.
A man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with raping him.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials have said such criticisms have a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and the dozens killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election provoked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, says that during the protests, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak's detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International cited the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer scientist, who claimed he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the outcome of the election.
"They often punch me in the face" in his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head. They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said some protesters arrested after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed he was held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had established committees to investigate the malaise of post-election and government response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the parliamentary committee's inquiries had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
He made a ski slope in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a race track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope at Brandon Hill Park was a short jump ramp, facing a 100-metre-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite scary.
You can see it under a beautiful view of the lights of the city flashing.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, real talent," he added.
Prizes were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After Thursday afternoon's event, the snow will be melted.
Even they and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a Lay State.
At a time when Swiss voters have called for a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the continent's most openly lay societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France's 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly worldly issues, he argues, things in daily life that worry the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, professors and intellectuals, none of them of renown, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation seeks to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern lay society.
They fail to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the Purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defending secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are probably treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to lay republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives "an adjustment of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most heartbreaking panorama
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it the life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have focused on newly opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear, in "On Thin Ice."
Aware of the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of courage by confronting the white bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, struggling only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, caught while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of the area in the realm of a wild adult. The weather is almost never adequate: a Singapore-resident polar bear turned green by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the massacre continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimo Snowmobile Indians use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters to the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a breathtaking look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
It's not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering journeys in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines drew a map of the quick ice laces that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite scans and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resilient individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within Arctic ice, made up of splashes of salt water that compresses as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice is removed, what is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months ... these could be us
Marines among the 6,000 who place crowns on Arlington graves
Pfc. De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, it was a day to pay homage to men and women who were once standing in their boots.
In a few months, from where we're being boarded, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd want someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place crowns on veterans' graves in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, kicked out the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year severing in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military personnel and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit, Wreaths Across America, that has extended the event to other states.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 kronor at the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked through the cemetery's wide meadows and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves in World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don't get as many visitors as the new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, while bringing the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, was virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 kronor to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud names sculpted on the stones, while others leaned over to see small black and white plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son's grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Gunner Sergeant. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor distributing mobiles and laptops in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
Specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost anything deemed "dangerous".
All so-called counter-re-violence activities, including light protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a fledgling blogger community, run by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sanchez has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permit has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor can likely cause tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a "slow-paced" approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to break the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete action, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; are mostly used for text messages, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes like drug trafficking.
Berbena said she couldn't provide any more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly misguided.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobiles for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, cuba itself", a reference to the site of Raúl Castro as leader of the country , to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in a day.
It stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries were beginning to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, demonstrating that they hope the case can help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who roam the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube internet video site.
Saifullah led the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case, said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al Qaeda commanders that men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
They were therefore ingested for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the towering mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered as part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men were not unmoved and were even trying to get proper approval to access the Al Qaeda camps, when Pakistani law enforcement authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who they are trusted.
Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
The organization's recruiters act as guards, not letting go of those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to holy warfare, and those who might be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is looking with particular attention at aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent enormous appeal, due to their potential to gain access to American goals and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years regarding those they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruiting model how many have already followed? Kohlmann said.
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate "action"
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets demanding that negotiators working at the city's Bella Center Convention Center take bolder actions for the weather.
Protesters said 100,000 people took part in the event, but police estimated that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that read "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish declaring, "Earth says "enough is enough."
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travels Peru, her mother's home country, made me aware of the harrowing issues the country must deal with because of the impacts of climate change that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great manifestation, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to circumvent it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of the use of masks or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near Copenhagen's main canal, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as called, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the TELEVISION screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China's chief negotiator on the climate.
When asked if he thought the event was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I wasn't really aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
It noted that it depended on each other's perspective to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this showed the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Evidence reveals persistent racial differences
Last week's federal scorebook on math performance was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the best-functioning systems in the country, the gradebook showed that fourth and eighth graders ditched at a faster rate over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent Figures of the National Educational Progress Assessment is the persistent performance difference between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
Average scores for white fourth graders in D.C. over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The performance difference actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-grade African-Americans remained essentially fixed, down a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
Average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE was unveiled in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely been reduced to 58.
Some education attorneys in the District expressed concern last week, as advances made by Rector Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by addressing those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I'm not jumping for joy over a two- or three-point difference, said D.C., Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By Accumulation), who has a daughter in fourth grade of the Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a regular critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of test scores is that the city's high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what's worried is that we're not de dedicating the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of under-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high- and middle-school students who did not master the basics of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday math, a math curriculum from kindergarten through sixth grade, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced to the District under former Superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by THE ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to lessen the difference.
Here's some kind of rugged dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the objective can have political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the black and white middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, are confident that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element in ending the performance difference is to extend the year of traditional public school, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It is necessary to reach almost 200 days to have the strength of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which she sees as an "indicator" to seek a greater increase in the next convention.
Making higher education a part of more future
The tour bus arrived at gettysburg University with a loud resused.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, descended and blinked for a moment in front of white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela's parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! This is where I'll be! Graciela exclaimed, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Gee, really, you said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the school's low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is which one.
While there is growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduate from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country's workforce.
Those who look at the highest-yielders say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Tour of Graciela Universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to run college readiness programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in restoring Iraq's oil industry, maimed by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away having bid on only two of the 10 auctioned deposits.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in opening Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the forefront, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, heightened by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdrew, probably prevented U.S. oil companies from taking more strong risks in Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have strengthened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main deposits.
We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological powerhouse, said Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies preselected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the barrel grant that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda's main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile attack on Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a major al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have passed away Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan Province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft of the CIA-operated type inside Pakistan's illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, an official from Pakistan's civil intelligence agency said, talking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited uns specified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking military planner of al Qaeda, who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He devoted himself to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks on the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to al Qaeda's senior command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen rapidly into the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a well-known name for some Americans, but that does not in any way diminish the threat posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led uns piloted aircraft strikes has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a tally by The Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit.
The decline is perhaps due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
The UN's highest envoy in Kabul about to resign
The united Nations top envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign his post in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was hurt by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghanistan presidential election.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the US timetable for military withdrawal beginning in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparedness of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
Commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also lobbied the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, working with Afghanistan's political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply keeping a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so I had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that you'd better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential vote and of covering evidence of mass electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said the accusations of Galbraith, who was fired, "surely hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also pushed for UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, stating that this would increase their confidence that their money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations to his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN procurement regulations undermine his ability to attract talent.
So the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and can't go on.
Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran for its failure to engage in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long journey in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he argued, in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population at large.
He argued that "a package of incentives and disincentives" would be needed, "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be actually less safe with nuclear weapons," because "their people will suffer enormously" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face "credible" consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the directions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
Speaking in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he would renegotiate on the restriction of his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his enriched uranium reserve, in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because Iranian command is divided on the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I believe that Iran's hardening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that has not been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline of December 31 for Iran to respond to proposals, before rethinking other options, including continuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "devastating sanctions."
In a statement made in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday "unfounded and baseless accusations," by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities, and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers , "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning, before flying to iraq's oil-rich Kurdish region, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-sharing.
Gates urged both sides to diminish the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates' words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve its security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them on the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to incentivize young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: By no means.
We have already given all our time and energy only for one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the policy of a single child was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously plump children, spoiled only children, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors," a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six of when the policy became effective, according to the Division
Demographics, while the number of 60-year-old residents and more is expected to exploit 16.7 per cent of the population by 2020 to 31.1 per cent by 2050. This is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and more posted nearly 22 percent of registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said fertile couples must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate future labour shortages."
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, though) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
Gradual relief
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and employment discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed politics for its contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in policy enforcement.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have performed abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on single-child politics.
In 2004, they allowed for more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are unique children, and in 2007 mitigated many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Peking University's Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to incentivize more births.
Almost overnight, posters ordering families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very un overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that they observed a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign launches, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Caolu Municipality in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want more children.
They want to give their first child their best, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided to them by the government.
Without a social protection net, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see single-child politics as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
Yes, we're being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she was too: "We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We're not used to taking care of others and we don't really want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more bluntly.
For parents with two middle-class careers, who reduce their birth rate, he said, it's about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between the age of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents' struggle during the early days of China's experiment with capitalism and don't want that kind of life for themselves," he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from the parents, he argued.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment", and the strategic "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best day care centers when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group outlines plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging stances and mutual recriminations, drew renewed attention on Friday with the dissemination of a document that envisages ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a time-running negotiation, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Drawn up by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to cope with short- and long-term global warming.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized an 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 per cent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their own over the same period by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also stimulated the talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years, to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday featured the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated the conversations last week.
U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make an agreement without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that America's top climate negotiator lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically cope with global overheating.
With the future economic trajectory of the world's major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that major powers are discussing who should afford the costs to limit greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold large emitters accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, argued Ulate, who also works as regional climate change advisor for Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, even if most major participants say that the talks will produce at most political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States developed a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most exceptional issues before heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran down the corridors of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, so they could delimit the claims to be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute mess of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists who play the guitar present evening shows mocking the countries that they say are being sold, and preliminary proposals are passed from hand to hand instead of via mail), poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice President for Global Policy of International Conservation.
Heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225 kmh train redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5.13am, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train exit that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 kmh, when it passes like lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas station in London, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transport, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected remote areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would shorten, and the shift from planes and cars to the railroad would reduce domestic coal emissions, as well as alleviate congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning, and fears about environmental damage can still slow Britain's high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as the Times learned.
This will provide you with a detailed next stage itinerary planned for the high-speed network.
The new line that links London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impact can be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within 25 metres of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The favored option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"This seems to be the most beneficial option," said a railroad member.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over a current hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 kmh, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to withstand trains 400 mt long, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital's space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to suit the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made until after a general election.
Even if you launch the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first trains would be forced to leave fast lines down existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point needed to ensure a change from aircraft to trains, a benchmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face off with the mortgage for an orange grove of £75,000 from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange grove he built at his constituency home.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that deputies were living "of rations," increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said the requests "couldn't be clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a double-decker house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby houses have sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange grove."
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds of his London property to his constituency home, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately 1,400 pounds per month in mortgage interest, as of March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than £1,800 per month.
Mr Duncan's Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage interest rate did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the loan of 75,000 pounds.
The standard BRE variable mortgage rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, a type it is now at.
The most recent document issued by the Authorities of the House of Commons shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request £1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as President of the House Opposition in September, after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that MPs had to survive "rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live by rations and be treated as m**rda."
He said: "I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don't. "
The MP, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole shaped like the sterling symbol on Mr. Duncan's lawn in protest, after it was revealed that he requested 4,000 pounds over three years.
Last night, when asked about the increase in the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved by both the salary office and later Legg."
He added: "It's not about evading and delinqueting or infriating the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn't be in any way clearer or simpler."
Come those who have faith, to see the Advent calendar of the Brighton Beach Palapa
Brighton's palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using carols as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 5.30am to 6.30am every day, with stuffed cupcakes and punch served for free.
The carols chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a HOve TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid cleric from the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christianity society."
"Why do we wait as a Church for people to come to a strange old building? I believe that the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
"The idea of the Palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to test and represent that through spirituality."
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested this Saturday in demand for an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
About thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded through the icy Danish capital in demand of an agreement to be reached by the United Nations Climate Change Conference by Friday. It would enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization of climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
Incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke shop windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
Riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, she said, are especially members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions in which hundreds of militants were arrested "without distinction," stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold."
The fairly peaceful demonstration left Parliament and took towards the Bella Center, the seat of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to enter.
A stage was set to host the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu led a candlelight vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by coach and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with sky-sucking shots responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call for Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate."
Today we take to the streets to seek compensation for ecological debt on behalf of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino member of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: there is time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry out, watercourses that you can walk through like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure in anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world."
The Asia Pacific region, which gathers numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red dresses and wearing scarves with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters calling for strong action against climate change were formed.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
Dozens of people were concentrated in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; However, Tbilisi denounces "fraud."
Some 131,000 people were summoned to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008 by control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
Polling stations closed at 5pm GMT.
According to the leaders of the Abkhazian Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before closing.
The first interim results would be announced saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in the race, including the outgoing president, Sergue Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the counting of votes.
These elections are a sham.
For his side, Georgian President Mikhe-l Saakachvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the full Russian occupation," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladzé.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory from 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following her separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand dead, Abkhazia attempts to demonstrate through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, declared to the AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who headed to the polling station at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a nice white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large planks show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin in different locations on this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian leaders who came to control the development of scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and particularly the decision to recognize abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexe Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes Russia control of the Abkhae railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus a vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a run-off will be arranged two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
About thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts until 18 December delegates from 193 countries, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
The fairly peaceful demonstration left Parliament and took it to the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
Protesters stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without trying to enter.
A stage was set to host the guest speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu led a candlelight vigil.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke shop windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP reporter reported.
Riot police surrounded them quickly and intervened firmly, throwing several of them to the ground.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, noting that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already performed during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, last April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was wounded in the jaw with a dodle, and four cars were set on fire near a busy house during incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We extremist groups didn't take our eyes off them, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by coach and train from the big cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, most with sky-sucking shots responded by forming a first morning rally in Copenhagen to the call for Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "justice and climate."

Oxfam, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which gathers numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, kicked off the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, some 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed red dresses and wearing scarves with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the City Council of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters calling for action against climate change were formed.

The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that it will be broadcast in the Sunday News (JDD), according to his French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" from general secondary education reform, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific high school.
From now on, all high school first students will have four hours per week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "hypocrisy is enough" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The General and Literary Teaching branches cannot be subramas of the C, he goes on to stress even: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged that they had eliminated history and geography second in high school."
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven Frenchmen out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government's project to eliminate compulsory history-geography education second in high school C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of removing philosophy from high school C's second program.
Luc Chatel also advocated the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) convened a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they said sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will take an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admissions test on their ability to teach, explained the Minister.
They will also do internships in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in internships.
If you do all the proposed pre-contest practices, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in National Education".
He also confirmed the project of removing the school map "before 2012".
At The Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Group on Climate Development (GIEC) invited by ulm Street's Higher Normal School, accepted on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, opened the conference conference "Ernest", a day composed of a series of presentations by fifteen-minute experts, filmed and open to the public, reported an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that attracted people and convey to them the desire to know more, explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22 years old, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish of the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from the experts in their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who exhibited without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people.
Part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record."
Videos filmed during those conferences will be online on the school's website starting December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is planned for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, action is planned
Prison guards' unions on Friday called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the new year-end holidays, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd guards' union) asked off-duty staff to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block" them to report the theft of their beings.
The prison CGT (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization", since it calls it "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first guards' union, the Federal Prison Autonomous Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury."
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased greatly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but say that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last minute of the day, the Chancellery reported that Micchale Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guards' unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by staff to function and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a package of measures to keep this situation from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours from taking place again in the future.
December's pay will then be low, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous performance and target premiums, and who "always blame budget demands," the Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It is a real scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille said outraged, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convenings".
The staff will not come to work on Sundays and corresponding holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threat FO Rhane-Alpes-Auvergne.
The moment we are increased by tasks and missions without taking more action, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salaries of the staff, estimates the CGT penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, not all regions have the same thing, as some are luckier than others.
But either way, the result is not as expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-Fran'ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than he gets
US President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first Family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous TV presenter, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: "I make better gifts than I get."
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast Sunday night, President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate New Year's Eve parties at their prestigious new residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be from the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the show transmitted in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: "No way, last year I gave you nice gifts," she said, provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before humorously replying to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the home, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday again operated, RTL claims he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was again involved in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" resulting from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims that the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again involved Wednesday night through Thursday at Cedars-Sina's hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors found "injuries arising from the operation" of herniated discs performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in that same city noted, stating that such injuries "needed a restorative operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace of mind by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would communicate within 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday nevertheless agreed to undergo an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications."
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will have more certainty about their condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced to it after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Monceau Park due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered Cedars-Sina's Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection arising from Delajoux's intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday's close friend, explained Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad time," but assured that there was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
He called me just before I traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was foolish to get a twelve-hour plane ride after such an operation, it's not possible, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, sought to reassure that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled."
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had had "colon cancer" surgery after a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been over commented on. Fans and journalists noticed the musician's difficulty moving around on stage.
In mid-November, his close friends even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Cups of long pool, won an international title on Thursday in a distance for which he has particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane swimsuits were last allowed, only three world records were surpassed when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m freestyle, a mark he owns in a long pool (20.94).
In one of the two queen distances of swimming, in 50 m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman prevailed with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a first internationally.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world record (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I was going to try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that from 1 January will be banned.
These swimsuits, the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the wearing of the swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark by 400 m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second-best time of his career (3:34.55), against Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up in depth in this race.
I knew I wasn't going to be able to break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: A sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold Thursday at $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, announced Sotheby's art dealer.
This 2-meter-long panel by 63 cm high dates back to the third century BC, and its price had been estimated to be between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is a rare piece, since there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told the AFP Florent Heintz on Tuesday.
It sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bid by buyers, no doubt, a Spokesperson for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy, pointed to the AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous Borges family collection in Rome, then appeared successively in the home of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her particular Parisian mansion, and in the home of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétaina sees power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérése Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to move Honduras' overthrown president Manuel Zelaya, to his territory, whom the coup government denied safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of the transfer, stated the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya back to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
To grant him safe conduct, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to arrive in Mexico as guest head of state in office.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from office (...), they wanted me to submit my resignation," Zelaya said Thursday at Radio Globo, in which he usually makes statements since the start of the political crisis that has been in the central American country for five months.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Minister of the Interior of the Coup government, Oscar Raúl Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya responded in an interview on the Telesur network, whose headquarters are located in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya's departure mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around brazil's embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
That reflects the marginal nature of this government in the face of international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela's Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must be brought to justice for the crime of "high treason," according to the coup government.
De facto President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected. This choice was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed rising on Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures are a true witness to the economic revival of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the tech-based Nasdaq 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We received good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass".
For Avalon Partners' Peter Cardillo, investors focused mostly on U.S. trade balance figures, "reflecting an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6 percent from September to $32.9 billion in October.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The great novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular exports of goods, which reflect the growth of major economies trading with the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the research company Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States unexpectedly increased, with 474,000 applications filed.
But over the course of the past four weeks, the average number of new job applicants "was the lowest for a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield was 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond yield was 4.492% against 4.408% on the eve.
Cuba: more than a hundred power supporters boo the "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of Supporters of Cuban power booed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted in the street by supporters of raul Castro's government as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of such detainees, an AFP journalist argued.
The Yankees die, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted with their fists aloft the militants of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by officers dressed as civilians who came to "protect" them.
On the eve, a similar demonstration broke out against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also rushing to demonstrate thursday for International Human Rights Day, was arrested by civilian-clad police officers, an AFP journalist reported.
The officers forcively put the dissidents who were booed by government supporters into the vehicles, according to that journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances only lasts a few hours.
The "Ladies in White", awarded the Sakharov Prize 2005 awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, purges a sentence of 20 years in prison.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call opponents "mercenaries" or "agents" on the payroll of their declared enemy, the United States.
A rare fact in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government militants against the "counter-revolutionaries."
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alienated man murders an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (High Of the Seine) on Thursday at the busiest time of the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor would have beaten an old man with two knives, and for undesired reasons, an old man, in the pharmacy or in front of him at No. 85 on Jean-Jaurs Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
As a result of the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 was killed in the hospital, according to a head of the Alliance police union.
Then at or in front of the pharmacy, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, in his thirties, got in the way and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elderly man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a blackout and was admitted "in shock," a police source reported.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped down Jean Jaurs Boulevard.
Apparently randomly, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: a thirty-year-old man, and a forty-strong man.
At night, the crime scene was still unclared.
He was armed with two butcher's knives that he had crossed in his back, explained at the site a head of the Alliance union in the Seine Heights, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alienation, according to the testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, explained.
A crowd jumped on him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Two municipal officers, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were punched, according to police testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very significant wound to his abdomen, he told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person arrived about 35 years old, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the High Seine Judicial Police (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his provisional detention he has not said a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of hospitalization.
According to another police source, it took six policemen to dominate him at Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "any deranged of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the case to be dismissed
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski's lawyer again on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, Western United States, to dismiss the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of "The Pianist," reported serious procedural errors at the time of the events before three judges of the Second District of California Appeals in 1977.
Hummel stated: Claim that the charges should be dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "proved chilling."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (who has passed away since) would have spoken to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before sentencing, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But wells eventually declared in late September "lying" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in the event that the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the arguments put forward at first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear in court.
The 76-year-old boy fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence for "illegal sexual intercourse" with a child under the age of 13 was handed down.
Since then, he's never set foot in the United States again.
Los Angeles District ViceFiscal Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "has to be here to appear at the hearing."
With this cause, do we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of fleeing?" asked Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor, even if he despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also highlighted "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel wasn't the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client no longer supports being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house in prison in his cabin in Gstaad, awaiting eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed aimlessly this Friday, in a market that is being debated between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the dollar hike: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the tech-based Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index advanced by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is getting smaller and I think it will stay that way until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market views on the soundness of economic revival," Charles Schwab analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence visibly recovered in December, 73.4 vs. 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were slowed by a further advance in the dollar that reached the highest level of the last two months against the euro, which "leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3,540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bond yield was 4.497% against 4.492% on the eve.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates are in the final stretch to fulfill her dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Sportswoman or even Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real stir.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw so many things and lived countless experiences, said astonished Miss Sierra Leone.
This ninth-time event in South Africa will air Saturday live from Midrand to North Johannesburg from 5pm (5pm GMT).
Impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived it twice, says Miss Mundo Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of re-discovering "breath-taking African landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, Miss World candidates focus on the pageant.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned bollywood stars.
Every woman's dream is to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declare Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
Candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, swimsuits.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a Miss World committee manager Steve Douglas will host the event.
South Africa proved capable of welcoming the world with warmth and pride that are difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Like last year, candidates did a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met south African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Something unusual for a head of state, miss Sierra Leone observes.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (South-Party) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd get to know.
She'll probably be back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," according to his son David
News about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, he told the press David Hallyday when he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13 h local (21 h GMT).
The singer's son, relaxed, said he would move "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sina's hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday for an infection resulting from the herniated disc operation on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment to him," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already undergone a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sina's Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday for an infection, following a herniated disc operation on November 26 last in Paris.
The singer underwent surgery once again wednesday through Thursday night due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by his daughter Jade, to witness a school event, confirmed an AFP photographer.
The Head of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salp.tere hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the international private clinic at Monceau Park in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
There's talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus argued that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too quickly to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem making the trip, as I was operated on twice as a herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he indicated that the singer had apparently "gone without a cannula, with nothing", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed from a brain haemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted of justice on several occasions by malapraxis, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Order Council, and is "far from recommended."
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
It indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause hemorrhagics and, portanto, did not need drainage," he added.
Either way, the singer's tour, whose health problems have multiplied since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, to resume the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I find very risky, Camus stated.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) association, controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of Francois Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offer) on the acronym of the former Giscardist party, encouraging him to withdraw it from all support, in the penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the acronym UDF, as he believes that Francois Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after reaching out to his left.
Moreover, the Minister of Defence, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the CN.
In support of its management, it received the help of Deputy Hervé de Charette (former UMP, present-day NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the OFFICE of the UDF association, controlled by Francois Bayrou's friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue an injunction to the Minister and the Congressman, encouraging them to give up the acronym and transfer the property rights of the brand to them, subject to legal demand.
These last few days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, write the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Francois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it correct to continue using the movement name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter hold.
As you know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the UDF name from all media, as well as from (its) website".
It also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) trademark to legitimate successors".
If not, justice will be used to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they states that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Center does not have, according to them, any right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to create an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when she registered the trademark", she was no longer "a member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It takes advantage of the lack of registration of the acronym UDF in an outrageous and fraudulent way to do so on its own.
This indiscretion is becoming a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC's strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make its own name than to try to leave anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Francois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to put the artist Francois-Marie Banier on trial to determine whether, as multimillion-dollar Liliane Bettencourt's daughter claims, she took advantage of the octogenarian's state of weakness to expose her to a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of show stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered liliane Bettencourt, 87, to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
L'Oréal's heiress and main shareholder always refused to submit to such reviews, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Physicians appointed on Friday must submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered states of weakness and during what periods.
I think he'll take it.
I'm going to talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as she left the hearing.
For his part, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer Olivier Metzner was pleased with the court's decision.
It's great news (...) The expert will show that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been criminal proceedings against Francois-Marie Banier, a multifaceted photographer and artist, accusing him of having taken advantage for years of her mother's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the merits of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas were sometimes a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she distrusted Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once to twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I could never speak to Francoise again."
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office considered, once again, that the applicant was not in a position to appear, all the more so since a guardianship judge refused, in recent days, to give rise to its request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to stand to justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardianship.
No one else will be able to appear instead," said Public Prosecutor's Office Representative Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule after the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Management revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a question of employees sticking to "values" determined from above as it was before it was about imposing products designed by factory technicians on consumers.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies of conquering the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are unrelated to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
Employee demobilization can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&amp;D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) "requires that all parties involved (...) have proactive behavior and a forward-looking vision." it needs a commitment on the part of employees that completely opposes the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we called for a managerial revolution, which would be to put employees at the center of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls are of relative use
Will internal opinion polls, such as Orange's questionnaire among its employees, incite the management revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many laps, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
-Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
Because they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the ancient behavioral theory that American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and which the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "commandos" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management stance, unacpathed to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies implies adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists of integrating into any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from Motifuncional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies showed that they judge their company on the basis of a pre-determined doxa that allows them, through their image of the company, to evaluate what the company offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilization factors, company managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate the management of human resources "on site".
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for "fair war" Obama receives praise from right
This Friday, the American right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "fair war" against America's enemies, hailed Obama's speech Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the obama award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, Ms. Palin, the main figure on the right wing of the Republican party to USA Today newspaper, said, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, set out, on Thursday in Oslo, to justify recourse to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama adversary, Newt Gingrich, felt the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really good, the former president of the House of Representatives was pleased, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich stated, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some regard as a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free or able to deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush's speeches and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world," as he "always does," he "spoke like an American president" in reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they didn't create and who don't do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few not very convinced right, a Bush-era falcon, former UN ambassador John Bolton called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and unspired" on the National Review Online website.
To the president's left, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying recourse to force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel prematurely, called his "superproduction" speech especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "delivered the speech that was necessary," the New York Times estimated, judging him "both bleak and uplifting."
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three marathon negotiation sessions, the road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat posed by Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "glad" by the agreement, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, negotiators said goodbye at dawn on Friday in hopes of quickly signing the text in agreement later in the morning.
Although three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew with a slam.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 o'clock was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6pm.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "was feared to disrupt new year-end parties," Bussereau said.
The text envisages a 4% increase for lower wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate goes up from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there should be no further outages or blockades in the supply centers.
But there may always be some dissatisfied rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal," although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages given international competition."
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) declared, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement."
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also envisages an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will allow, above all, to address the issue of extraordinary pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a 100 million euro drop in employers' burdens" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 rectifying finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it "on the same terms."
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, first, to the undertakings affiliated to that organisation and, secondly, to the entire profession, should the Minister of Labour make an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations could only delay the process.
FNTR reported that it was a "naive business", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset some of the CO2 tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to contradict those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, the Unostra lamented.
For OTRE, the agreement puts at risk "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months".
RER A: weekend conflicts, unions dissatisfed with RATP proposals
The conflicts in RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday's meeting, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and ratp management, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 8pm, at the rate of one train out of two on the central stretch (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were glad that "RATP strives to serve large stores."
RER A crosses the Parisian city from West to East.
The RATP stretch runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains circulated at peak times, and almost no train at valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder on the platform thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially for the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time."
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement.
RER As operating the SNCF from or bound for Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, of a meeting held with management on Friday afternoon will be analysed.
The director of the RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That's not what drivers who claim a premium they're owed want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT said outragedly, noting that management "was unable to solve a problem that SNCF and the road sector had already solved."
A new meeting is planned on Monday for "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of exercise of the profession," ratped.
Which also led unions to say that the company "didn't care about weekend users."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who until then refused to engage in dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, after unsa and the Indépendants have made a notice.
Unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions in this line that has one million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves prokurdo party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main prokurdo party, a decision that immediately provoked angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that harmed the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kilia told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a majority of seven votes were needed to obtain the dissolution, Kili's said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Turk and Ms. Aysel Tugluk, are removed from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Therk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of party assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament before being non-partisan-labelled parliamentarians.
The decision stems from a procedure launched by Supreme Court Prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal-inkaya in 2007, accusing the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that DTP is the legal political showcase of PKK rebels.
However, the party claims it has no "organic ties" to the PKK, but refuses to classify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict intervenes at a time when the government reaches out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to a escalation of tensions in southeastern Anatolio, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Acalan degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large town of The Southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
Law Enforcement threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters dropped Molotov bombs or slingshot stones.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, he stated that the decision of justice would "deepen discouragement."
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurda, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
That's not how anything is resolved, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel said.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks of recent months.
Snowfall can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is by no means something that wishes to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in winter of the FES
But with it your employees can learn to test and master all of the vehicle technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time over the weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case the FES acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as it snows profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-sections with large salt vehicles come out, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstracae.
But also the accesses for the fire brigade, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstra.
FES service starts around 3 a.m.
They should be covered approximately 1,040 kilometers, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts around 3 a.m., "with it the tracks are free until peak-hour traffic begins."
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30 a.m.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for salted vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it is up to the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Strae also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the inconvenience is generated, Brauburger knows well.
Around five o'clock in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly dangerous points and cruisers are cleared.
Usually the FES could not take care of all the bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 hours does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these quickly become slippery, the salted vehicle starts up as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Cradle of the Dinosaur
The Tawa hallae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-metre-long, 1.50-meter-tall animal running on the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Journal of Science.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at the time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea at the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis team member of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they gathered in total the remains of five specimens.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt is an exceptional find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not quite share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
So the experts are discussing, for example, on when saurios were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: carnivorous theropods including Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and birds, quadrupedal sauropods known as "long neck" and their relatives, and Hervorous Ornithischiabi (saurios with bird pelvis), to which they belong, , the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, nesbitt says.
For example, in Tawa's skull found evidence of air pockets, such as those also possessed by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to airbags, bird breathing is more efficient than mammals.
In Tawa's case he also found the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of later giant sauropods also possessed airbags and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs previously known lived in South America, researchers deduce that saurios first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages were originally separated and spread from South America throughout all corners of the Earth, which at the time still formed a unique land mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say the team found along with Tawa to find the remains of two other not closely related theropods.
All three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line of reptiles to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of mesozoic remains an enigma.
Meanwhile, in the Triassic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurios.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct on the triassic boundary towards the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction that dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to defeat the opponents in the area.
Success stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact brakes the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and had since led to a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna and Berkeley, California participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino at Goethe University in Frankfurt reverberated around the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
The university's president Werner Muller-Estler evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike, because the walls and artworks were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police commando".
Eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "the delegitimization and criminalization of protest" and deviated attention from the content.
The Board of Directors has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers require the immediate withdrawal of the court claim.
Most occupants have not caused property damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
The young people of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
Protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, says Verdi's national youth secretary, Alexander Klein.
Hessen's Minister of Sciences Eva Kohne-H'rmann (CDU), defended, however, the actions of the university's rector and the police.
We're grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in an Aktuelle Stunde broadcast Thursday in the Parliament of Wiesbaden Province.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism, said Peter Beuth, delegate of the provincial parliament by the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying students' arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has filed a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of Moscow's ten districts, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted Riedberg's scientific headquarters in Frankfurt, the university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Close Collaboration Protocol" in Frankfurt.
The Vice-Mayor of Mexico Juri Rosljak and the mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises from the Natural Sciences Research Center will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to major Russian companies and research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortia Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Socialist Planning" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") was named after the landscape of wooded mountains, in which research facilities were set up.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not positioned high enough at all.
For the supporters of the project it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
So the law. S21 is much more than reducing a railway station, without a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-W'rttemberga region a decade of chaos from irretrievable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered 19th-century engineering fossils, acting as brakes on modern rail traffic, as it once took an enormous amount of time to engage locomotives from back to front.
Roll, stop dry continue the journey; but that's the way it should be done.
And that's why the terminals should have disappeared: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is located approximately halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be started, even though the visions of the 80's are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost unpayable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course also have no more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's cart at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new stretch built ICE towards Ulm will already be initiated.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it that way.
The railway continues, too, because the risks of the Republic's large individual infrastructure projects are carried by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, equipped with many green areas, probably from the designer's computer-generated graphics.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At the time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably greener than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the Ministry of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometers of long rails across the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 the slow-pace layout has been built.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator properly.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the ruling on the airport.
The federal government leaves it pending in the regional parliament of Wiesbaden, if it is going to file an appeal in the face of a ruling on the night flight ban of the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to legally investigation the VGH ruling, more than 400 pages, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had founded in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport, the land state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as envisaged by the federal government, would not be reconciled with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until January 4, whether to file an appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive appeals to the nation's Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schofer-Gombel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections. Otherwise this could be taken as a lack of word.
It's quite difficult, if you're allowed to keep your word, said green chief Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We keep our word."
Minister Posch rejected the recrimination of Schsfer-Gombel, that the federal government would be trying through misrepresentations of law and tricks to still get its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally unimpeachable decision, said Stefan Muller (FDP).
As the opposition represents it, it would never have been his group's claims about the night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks return the aid provided.
Big U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state ties.
The Bank of America returned at once the aid provided to it by the Tarp bank bailout fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately EUR 30 billion).
And the Citi group also plans to return state aid, according to a report by the US CNBC.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised approximately 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had quite a few means, among others for the sale of items.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis thanked American taxpayers on Wednesday night especially: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The bank house had miscalculated the investment bank's absorption effort at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to free themselves from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported from a source of well-known circles that the US bank could announce by Thursday the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had returned their aids.
Quick choice
In the end it was all faster than thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative council of the ZDF (German television channel) pressured editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can introduce a successor.
Last night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF's main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially so as not to anticipate the procedure.
But surely it also influenced not to further damage the director of the ZDF Markus Schochter, if this proposal would not be approved on the administrative council either.
Frey, the candidate of Schachter, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the close of writing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, he failed on the administrative council with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schachter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because most of the Union on the administrative council had already indicated weeks before the election that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the president of Hesse's government, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument that under Brender's direction the ZDF news members would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests over this, in which he scoured political influence over the ZDF.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had even meddled in the debate, who called Koch's conduct unconstitutional.
But it didn't do any good.

Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Romanesque politics, pedagogy and philology.
He then worked on the station "Sodwestfunk" and in the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed for the ZDF, in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Next stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 Washington correspondent; until 1998 director and driver of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy at the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The Green political party announced a constitutional demand after Brender's dismissal, which was still elected on Wednesday as journalist of the year by medium magazine Medium Magazin.
Koch's opposite on the administrative council, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that federated states should change the ZDF state convention in such a way that the director's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A retreat of pro-ZDF control guild politicians was ruled out by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended himself to the administrative council with a clever move: he heavily criticized the guild for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, both Schéchter was able to appoint him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, and the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the position to a supporter henchman.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded anyway to left-wing liberals.
College careers clear
Partial success for students: After a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor's and master's degrees.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the test load: basically each module in the race should end with a single exam.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and we want to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam results between Universities inside and outside Germany.
Federated states are committed to making structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of federated states diverging from this should no longer exist.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the rectors of the universities are continually talking about the improvement of being able to successfully realize and conclude a career (studyability).
Now for the first time there was talk of a specific content.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam", it is said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "sensible reduction of the burden of examinations" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studyability" must be the decisive criterion in configuration.
Modules and content should be thoroughly examined for unnecessary student restrictions in choosing..
courses.
Students would have "the right to more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative."
These rules would apply to new races, but also in examining existing races.
These must be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country-level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is installed by the federated states.
Ministers of education and culture urged the federated states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
Until now only Rhineland-Platinada ensured that additional means were provided for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement student tutoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam and foreign offices.
The Land and universities intend to have EUR 10 million for these purposes.
In early 2010 the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single exam should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should become more flexible, in addition it is necessary to guarantee the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all careers about their "studyability".
This Thursday the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions of study in the state of the land.
In addition to the praise there were also criticisms about the decisions.
The federal board of directors of Juso (Young Socialists) university groups required that the configuration of education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" by ministers and university rectors.
No later than the education strikes, students as the main students involved should now be able to have an opinion as well.
The chairman of the Board of University Rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, supported the students: "We need the experience of the students," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with which hrK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union requires a legal right for each student with the Bachelor's degree the possibility of entering a later Master's degree.
In addition, federated states need to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are enough study places for Master in the future with the best possible conditions of study. This was reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
Federated states have to find a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master's degree, the Ministers of Education made no comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Muller
"Entering and leaving Germany becomes virtually uncontrolled," says the first line of a poem by the lyrical Werner Sollner in unbalanced language fragments, in which he thematicizes the arrival experiences of Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a german-English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader at a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
He was given several literature awards, in 1993 he taught the memorable poetry lessons or talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum at Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said he talked a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, he read a statement in which he admitted to im's participation in the Romanian secret service Securitate against fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
In conjunction with some of those present in 1989, he had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
"Therefore, I am someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against the Securitate's attempts at fear," S.
The lyrical Werner Sollner is IM Walter.
At about the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Muller and her unelike literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that demonstrates the chasms and evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Sollner is, as far as it is known so far, is not only an author, but also a victim.
In his Record of Securitate IM Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after the confession of Sollner, and emphasized the positive influence on him ofIM Walter.
He had excused or defended him in all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
"I feel the moral need to make this statement," he said.
His statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, Herta Muller wrote as early as July in the weekly "Zeit", having read her own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and know in some cases what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the Securitate's handling of the control files is still quite fuzzy.
Systematic clarification has been boycotted and difficult in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the Securitate (CNSAS) files, corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather flushed.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Muller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite great. In this interview a former head of the Temesvar Securitate spoke derogatoryly about the decorated.
"She has psychosis, " in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without laps in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, unavoidable questions arise with the Sollner case, as so many times when there are silent faults.
Why right now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to the confession of Sollner hopes that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the cravings for knowledge and not so much by the adjudication of guilt and by shame.
For the genesis of Herta Muller's work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of Stuttgart's VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, he gave the impression that an elegantly dressed outer service member was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration , in which the manufacturer of sporting goods had distributed samples.
The bald characteristic man had hired a chauffeur, because he did not yet know the city.
Moreover, he could also have driven the car himself: at the end of the day, there was no alcohol at stake, and neither was the 55-year-old drunk with joy.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work would begin again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the eighth round", namely in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 triumph against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against relegation."
The "most important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evident again, after the rapid three goals of Marica (5), Tr'sch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw
The champions' round eight (first leg matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December at Nyon.
So joy was kept limited by the fulminant entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the so-called savior, who had soon inspired Stuttgart's bewildered profis self-confidence, willingness to surrender and a taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their strengths, I edested them to be more thrown, explained the soul repairman Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer had an effect.
He deployed a certain magic, Babbel's supporter Jens Lehmann accepted, "when a new impulse emerges in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a pause of several weeks due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the perceived "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the new boss's way of working: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what had evidently been lacking when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, sports manager Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the win against a defence weakened by lack of relays and totally oversteal of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 the sad awakening had arrived, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We haven't gotten over the problem yet.
That Heldt did not feel like celebrating on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at its headquarters for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the board of directors, who had decided to change coaches because of pressure from teenage fans.
Also that his day off after the games had been eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt re-arranged, and announced consequences for the zaguero.
They probably won't be friends forever anymore, the two quadrennies.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without previous efforts with the replaced coach's team, the spectacle of great play and battle force would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important participation in success," Heldt and Lehmann said in uniesono; and also agreed the man in the plastic suitcase.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Burning duel in Bern: time and time again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judges' trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat American Kevin Johnson on Friday night to Saturday in Bern by unanimous point decision (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already a two-time world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knock-out that everyone had hoped for could not be performed.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of about 17000 spectators at the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimetres lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging time and time again from the world champion's punches, so Klitschko could not decisively lead his dangerous right-handed target.
Generally speaking, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely hit the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who lasted twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as "horrible zombie," who "can't do anything."
At the weigh-in, the champion let himself be provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so that he could see his eyes."
Fourth win after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of nearly four years, he then defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had regained "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he later defeated In his title defenses Juan Carlos Gómez, of Cuba, and in September Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only took one hit, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to bring together all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 metres tall in November.
In the previous summer, Haye had canceled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
Supposedly, the company touting him is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Front attack of the opposition: the head of the green group, Jorgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar because of false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and leftists demand explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the most recent revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), for having publicly deceived him.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast on the ARD television channel, the head of the Green group, Jorgen Trittin, said that the minister had "knowingly not told the truth" about the deadly bombardment of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without regard to the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of NATO's report, which Mr Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it had been made known that this attack was not only about destroying hijacked trucks, but also intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. airstrike, requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left on Saturday urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and if the chancellery, army, and information service have approved this new strategy, they demanded J. Trittin and his green colleague Renate Konast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected criticism.
The chancellery exerted no influence over specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also been expressed about the Ministry's presentation of the grounds for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on convoys.
It had officially been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it transdied that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report of a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
So far he has received no response, he said.
The ministry did not express itself on Saturday regarding the criticisms made to it, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's committee of inquiry, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
In a state of wakefulness, some people see images and hear voices that others don't see or hear.
It is not only in the case of the mentally ill and the drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can give ourselves unneeded to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during vigil, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often regarded in the modern Western world as a madman or a drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or the drugged.
It is our imagination to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality.
Dreamlikely modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of new Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, shamanic states of possession, and psychosis and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of communication neural substances in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over it
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a state of wakefulness, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the depropositos, crazy formations, and mirages of it".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
Its body is two dimensions and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red grimaces like blood, deformed, grinding teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him in heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pains all over his body.
Raucous, malignant voices echo from the walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires from the stereo, ties them to form a hanging knot, and secures them to a hook on the ceiling.
It rises in a horn and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump.
The rope's loose.
Let it be a lesson to you, shout the voices in a chorus that bursts his eardrums, "go to the clinic and have them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
The cause of it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, for three years he's been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
Schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he is overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
That's why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remain in principle as is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the esttachment from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it's still an unknown why our brain makes cabriolas.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to temporarily lose touch with reality.
But not everyone develops psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinants.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain's neural maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of psychosis when there is already a prior disposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis by interfering with the brain's transmitting system.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says professor in psychology Erich Kasten of Lubeck.
Feeling a hallucination as pleasant or not depends frequently on the point of view.
Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analysed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The Unreal World in Our Heads), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
These include, along with psychic disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's and head trauma.
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or under-inhibited; when our brain warms up, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of loves or other avoiding brain states.
In j'ngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an, mindestens einmal im Leben eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. He was 16 years old, living in a small town in Western Mecklenburg-Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it wasn't for those images and the voices.
Sometimes, during recess, it happens that a clumsy boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her in surprise; nobody, other than her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a slightly strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She's awake and she sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When in class he sometimes cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he visibly and audibly explains the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for the dream to come, which is often late and sparse, she cannot tell if she is awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, yell at the figures.
Her parents and friends haven't told them anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. He's 20 years old today.
She passed last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
It's been a year since the hallucinations disappeared.
Ever since she's come into contact online with psychologist Kasten, she knows she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or undergoes a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while they will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and takes care of it for entertainment.
Sarah K., the only child, was afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man dad calls since he was using reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected as Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," Kasten says, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, so they seem so real."
Kasten also classifies nighttime fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses Hospital in Dusseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that can subsequently not differentiate from being awake.
Dreamlike conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or illness, such as in patients with polyrradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being fully conscious. die bei vollem Bewusstsein eine motorische L'hmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world due to total and permanent motor incapacity, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of his own and imaginary that is decoupled from reality.
A form of a limit situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change of world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbeatable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of soul rescue.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on multi-day journeys following an operation of heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immersed himself in a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was prostrate in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watched over his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorbike kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with firn snow and met a Korean mobster.
He gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so it describes your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental travel are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience will dilute the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and narcotics consumption show how fragile the inner reproduction of outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Each modification of the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten sums up, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
The children will take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen has come to an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding company will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they're trained to do it.
You can't put your children in front of 7,500 workers if they're not skilled enough for it.
That would wipe out the children and also the company.
Burda released on Thursday that he will retire from January of the chairmanship of the board of directors and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for the technology.
Later, he took care of the treasury and with it came responsibility for the company's assets. After the departure of J. Todenh.fer he also took over direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member occupies the pinnacle of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who was currently 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding company will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family businesses are also not safe from decline: "This has always affected families who let themselves be infected by the desire for capital search, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That's never been my strategy.
I've never had "delusions of greatness," Burda says.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don't want to play time in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything you - in terms of beauty and well-being - can wish for, at your fingertips.
This is what El Corte Inglés seems to have proposed, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai - which is responsible for laser hair removal; Spaxion, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teteria stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to ride your own beauty party with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and having a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxión.
In total there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and newest facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as cavitation to combat cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of customers, offering them a totally personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to correctly perform our exercise table.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles in the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 at night.
Varied necklines
Christmas is coming and it never goes any further to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It's not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The power company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, have created the 'LIVE Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville add to the project.
They are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The power company Endesa already has signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include energy-related activities and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has assets a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Shoemaker sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Government President's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the exercise to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closing some of our main production plants," the president of the government said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, it recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernize existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government demand support measures, in reference to the 2000E Plan, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the President, this plan has reduced by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Hall will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.

Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportsmanship
Mazda wants to show that sportsmanship is not at odds with respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system - dubbed i-Stop - a device that is at least currently only available with the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation Mazda3 stands out for the good grade achieved in its entire ensemble.
The finishes, the completion of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we check that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
Also, the feel of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Continuing with the set formed by the instrument panel and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with lots of buttons and knobs and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the one also presented by the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing the cabin, this Japanese compact has more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine and six-speed manual shifting.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, its reduced rumours, for the performance and for achieving contained consumption.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those that do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this gasoline-powered i-Stop, both for its high running comfort and for its contained consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, that is, the one that incorporates a greater number of serial elements.
From the standard equipment stands out especially the lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates blind angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on an oversized screen, parking sensors, independent climate control, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
In addition, as if that were not much of its equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive headlights bixenon and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for its behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not make many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 150-horsepower engine.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the proven version -Sportive-.
In return for this high figure, Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L. A. covers the red sensuality carpet by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' in the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as it usuals, opted for a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even being able to see certain types of attachments or browse the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the year's products.
Seeing it on the street is harder, really, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone's data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times as much for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It's just as limited as its American counterpart, but it comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price of about 12 euros per month includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone already know what it's like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately search for a coffee shop with WiFi (or a Fon connection) in order to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly appealing and would have to be up and running for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print.
The European Commission's repeated ear pulls to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have had little noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (it is curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets such rates means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other internet queries.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that's what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a purchase option with lifetime access like the one Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my mail on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it's a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
Michelle's fetish color
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the First American Lady.
If you have already attended Barack Obama's inauguration as PRESIDENT of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, you have chosen it to accompany you in undoubtedly the second most important moment of your life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - greenish yellow with bright reflections - the two times the attire consisted of three pieces - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurium.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the inauguration it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
Accessories have also varied: half-heeled green shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a pick-up on this occasion, loose mane the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Fertility and work history of women in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women between the age of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study notes that there are many differences in the onset of couples and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an uns stable job, start partner coexistence first, advance first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and motherhood, and have less offspring.
"Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time than their life trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work done has a lot of influence on motherhood but less on the schedule of pairing," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that differentiates women's age by getting married and having the first stem.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age at which they marry and at which they have the first child.
The difference also remains between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education have been mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 on average respectively.
"Another division is also established among women according to their level of study.
While those with elementary studies marry and have their first child before achieving a stable job, those of medium or higher levels reverse this sequence and prioritize obtaining stable work as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child," Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is worth it, too
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to her envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will become an image of different products of the brand, intonating the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noél', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous signings of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spain's Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetic brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its highest representatives - designers and models, from yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, named Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's poker
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Póquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through his literary life (and, in cases, also the other).
It does not do so in predictable and fearsome genres (biographical semblance, life and work), but seeking something similar to the ignition core of the creative character.
The trip has its excitements and Vicent does not save scares or illuminations.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and readings.
Here are some snapshots.
About Albert Camus: "In its pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, pulse that I felt without giving it name: pleasure against fate, guiltless morality and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in the intellect, between helplessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that came close to killing him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he conjuded the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of doom."
About James Joyce: "The Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north wall, from which the best mountaineers take off again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weirdo.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was heir to a county landowner and others who was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insmented cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to bring his echo to the bottom of the 20th century night under his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she got down on her knees and prayed, 'God dear, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after war,/ after life fed up pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted normally that she would tell her that Edward VII spied on her among the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
It has never been the case of such a patient man and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness."
About Pius Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to get Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man's fame to serve as his own pedestal?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 walked past her and our dog, a specimen of mixed breed, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilos of weight and, without a word , they kicked him twice that left the dog badly hurt.
Our outrage is capital because we didn't find the fun in a free assault on a small, helpless animal, which by the way, was tied up.
To this we must add the suffocation that caused a lady who walked quietly and who, when he incredulous these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at five o'clock on any Tuesday afternoon through a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station that we doubted would do much good and not generate susceptibility, just to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Outrage has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people to consider it fun to mistreat for free a helpless animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don't know where good education and respect for animals and people have stayed.
Michelin and Fesvial together by wearing the helmet
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among younger motorists, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of avoiding head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and stated that it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet on the motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
Finally, Michelin highlighted that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
Up the sale of light commercials
Nearly two years later, the light commercial vehicle market starts to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employer of the manufacturers Anfac and that of Ganvam sellers.
The good data, not osbtant, should be quarantined as the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly poor, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite last month's uptick, the enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% lower than in the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold in addition to all the vehicles that make up the tailor's drawer of light commercials: passenger car derivatives, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Likeever, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, although they are also acquired by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
So to the restrictions of closed tapping of bank loans, other factors must be added, such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In view of this picture and unlike passenger cars, aid for the purchase of the 2000E has been of little use.
They can be benefited, in addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, from Ganvam they recalled again the need to devote special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists (trucks and buses).
The sellers' association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (of passenger cars and 4x4).
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with ABS brake anti-locking and will go through ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they already are in all new enrolment passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a gap period is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian protection although, by the way it works, it can also help prevent many collisions by scope.
The emergency braking assistant does is increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the trampl given by the driver.
But this one doesn't always hold that pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the car component manufacturer Bosch, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brakes before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum to the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four claims with harm to people would be avoided - when so-called the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via radar or camera) detects obstacles and alerts the driver, in addition to acting lightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays Opel plan until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been notified by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - on the 8th probably - according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will need more time to conclude the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, GM Europe's new president, intends is that each of the points in the plan has previously been agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of countries where there are factories, to be delayed until early 2010.
By contrast, GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is not strange to this that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but takes on the option of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to China's Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if not sold.
Behind the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To unpack his latest, and jewellery-faced, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 kilos, leaving the scale at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to do without, first of all, the automatic roof that has been supplied by a canvas with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, another 15 'fall'; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, gained 7 kilos more; riding sports bacquets another 12 and with light 19-inch, five tires.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system provided another six kilograms and swaps the door handles for some fabric, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the dual-clutch PDK shift, the test was performed on a unit with the six-speed manual box, mainly on california side roads, on mountain stretches with really twisted paths
Your behavior can only be described as unimpeachable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, quite the opposite: we haven't tried such a small, lightweight model in a while transmitting so much safety in the corner, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short gear for as long as necessary, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and repress his engine...
Whatever we ask. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it needs, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very accomplished and can be boosted with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the bellows of the engine, already previously released in the Panamera.
Acceleration capability is brutal, either from standing or in recoveries.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the potholes well.
Electronic aid barely made an appearance all the way; and that in one of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, already well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be released in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate with Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer produces her malota face with as much contumace as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia gives a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant 82-91 win on their visit to Maccabi Electra's complicated court, despite the numerous kills that Dusko Ivanovic's team had, and in this way he is in the lead of his group, following the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples scored was the best of his team (29 rating).
The Vitorian team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although they had to suffer until the end to claim victory.
In addition, the big hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match began face to the Azulgranas, who stood from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Vitorians were from the perimeter already foreshadowed that they had jumped on the Israeli court with their wrists warm.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavés team opted for Barac's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with dicks and applause on his return home, to further expand his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'minus six' valuation already foreshadowed that this was not going to be the Brazilian's best night.
But the match, despite being on track at half-time, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians that on their court no one wins, and with 'Elijah's hand' squeezing they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning the luminous (50-49).
More drawbacks
Ivanovic's, wounded but far less dead, needed to spin a couple of plays right to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring rent (54-67), which managed to make up the premises at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The alaveses came out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign themselves and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's did not rush, they defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already owned and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent the Unicaja from being battled
Unicaja lost sharply in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Euroleague Group B, in a match marked by the casualties of the boxmen, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and also by the rival's entity, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and on a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, daessled the locals 12-18, 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of unicaja, although the arsenal of locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, at which point an action, fighting conato, between the two US bases Beverley and Williams, resulted in the disqualification of both players.
The Greek ensemble began operating showing its superiority within both zones, where English epivot Joel Freeland's injury drop and Carlos Jimenez's three personal fouls were lasing out of the boxmen.
Between the interior players and Lithuanian eaves Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An impossible comeback
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, was superior and even came to match the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the leadership of the group stagger.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last kill of Scottish epivot Robert Archibald, injured during the match.
Despite all the drawbacks the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis's contribution, it left some hope 66-57, 31st minute.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when it pressed and given its superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
Croatian epivot Nikola Vujcic managed to trace the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and unicaja went out, handing over the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application of Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.

In the week that the application has been in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels underpaid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to Trovit's data from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 euros gross annually and a French one, 31,059, compared to 24,000 received by a Spanish one.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by that of dependent, with 14,725 euros; and the operator's, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets date on Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set deadline for Manuel Zelaya's tenure at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed President shall leave the diplomatic delegation by 27 January 2010, when he would officially complete his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, business manager of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date from the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to find another destiny."
The broadcaster also quoted the former representative, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 election (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya claimed that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, e this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was eventually thwarted by Zelaya's rejecting the status of political asyle that was intended to be imposed on him by roberto Micheletti's "de facto" government.
Thanks a lot
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, uncertainty once again reappears in the markets, which should come as no surprise as it is its natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by an uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with direct asset purchases and indirectly by giving free bar of liquidity at rates close to zero for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended and, without questioning its heterodox liquidity policy, begin to pour some sand into the gears as the ECB did with its auction a year next week.
Investors therefore doubt the world economy's ability to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond spreads have rebounded, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge of choice by investors, causing an expansion of eurozone countries' spreads from Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability but that was where Standard & Poor's arrived and threatened a new down revision of the Kingdom of Spain's rating.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not go wrong to silence moral hazard advocates who were once again trying to raise awareness of those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of restricting credit on job destruction, when what needs to be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving.
However, dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to rebuild power in the emirates and greece we've seen it before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government pulling the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durao Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments earlier this year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and make its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of normalization of transient risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be as expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt spreads widen just like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If European spreads decrease and ours continue to widen, then it would be Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our forward indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to upwardly review their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, they return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur much life expectancy to their warning.
Again, it looks like it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, driver friend".

The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain's energy strategy is debated these days in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some brushstrokes of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, provided that nuclear power plants are kept open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be used to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and in international interconnections
From 2020 on, the issue changes and power will have to be increased.
Its commitment focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 mw new, however, with other "support energies" are needed.
Galán, who believes that the sustainable economy bill just passed by the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to incentivize the consumption of domestic coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his view, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "one-off" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
Either way, Galán believes that investment decisions, while long-term, must begin to be made as they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus 'handling' at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for onshore airport services, Switzerland's Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, from which the economic terms have not been transcended, lasts for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Center
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Acciona contests its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for its first concession highway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water management company.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel worth A$1.7 billion (about 1.047 million euros).
Frenchwoman Bouygues and German Hochtief are her rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a motorway builder and concessionaire.
City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, in a business plan guarded by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids next May, the projected investment amounts to A$1.7 billion (EUR 1,047 million) and three consortia with a notable presence of European construction companies compete in the final phase.
The group dubbed Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spaniard in contention, and his companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
The Northern Direct consortium plays against Acciona's team, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium to have passed the screen is the so-called LBRJV, where the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Spanish civil works firm Razel, share capital.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large works and privatizations, but it entails a clear difficulty of entry if it is not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
AcS has barely achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance to the sector, in which it already has an outstanding presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies responsible for lifting and managing the Adelaide desaller, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention now is to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link, is called to link the western Toowong Highway with the ring road in Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometres of tunnel. This is the biggest action to reduce congestion in Brisbane's traffic.
The timetable set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be finished until 2016.
The tunnel began designing in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute A$500 million (308 million euros) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who yesterday announced a contract with the Government worth 154 million.
AcS is going to enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fiber-optic wired broadband network.
This performance will provide quick internet access to 400,000 people and give German work for 18 months.
In addition, the company has transferred the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. Work was yet to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, it will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC wins 64 million tunnel in Slovenia
FCC, through its alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia amounting to 64.5 million euros.
The firm gets this contract days after taking over the expansion works of the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in the construction of tunnels.
Work is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will run for 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore awards Renfe advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to Ms Rushmore for approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that ran for the Renfe-convened competition of which four were finalists, including TBWA which was responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
Fine of 63 million to France Télécom for curbing competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a fine of EUR 63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to that institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, price plans and consumer loyalty programmes outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for locking up its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore repeat offenders.
App store
Moreover, the French company's mobile subsidiary has followed in the light of other operators and opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UNITED Kingdom.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barca since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth clubs that have won the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spaniards) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out well from this cast.
The white club has been the third on the continent that has pocketed the most money for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, who has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the reigning champion and the last winner of the defund European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also billed the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has made the most money through the Champions League, despite having won more titles than any other (five, for the four from Italy, the three from England and the two from Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by UEFA's complicated money-sharing procedure.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money UEFA will dedicate 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atletico Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just because they were there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each party they contest.
There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for tying (400,000 for each team). The eighthfinalists will receive three million each; eight quarter-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be pocketed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, up from the finalist's 5.2 million.
Thus, as fixed payments, a club will deposit at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barca, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also the variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spaniard is one of the main ones, and has four assigned seats.
The previous year's champion gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third, and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year's edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group yesterday broke down the details of the share purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require you to launch a public takeover offer (opa) for all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and would be paid with an interest in this postponement of 1% per annum
Yesterday Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa's offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 directors.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV claimed not to have been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If done, disbursement would reach 611.7 million when sos' capitalization is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of purchase and the judicial swings of their former managers, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group's chairman.
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the coming months Sos will reveal further diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, the former directors Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared at the National Hearing yesterday and stated that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
CNMV authorizes Paternina exclusion opa submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the opt-out step presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation on the understanding that its terms conform to existing rules and consider the contents of the explanatory prospectus submitted after the amendments made on 2 December "sufficient".
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been frozen, which could not be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, from which it specified that the price was fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New tools to peritate cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a claim are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No claim is the same, and calculating parts costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Calculating annually the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including construction ymano parts, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of tiny
That's why almost 100% of experts use such systems.
Service providers and solutions for claims assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided to them by manufacturers, and then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of valuations are made with their products.
The other firms competing in the field of appraisal and information development tools in the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of them provides them with the information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that more versions, variants and engines have been released in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car goes to market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult task, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and introduce its price.
In addition, each model is made a graphic image "smart" where you can "click" different parts of tourism.
If it's an advantage model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes too fast.
If it's a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that runs, they exceed 99%.
To carry out documentation work and the elaboration of databases, Audatex has eight centers throughout the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros per year in developing these databases.
Each month 2.5 million data is included, and customers receive updates every other day.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer varied products.
The most common use focuses on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for managing scrapping parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of those used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but it does offer it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support they can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the star product being AudaPlus, the standard claims valuation solution, aimed at experts.
Includes cars, motorbikes and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint railings.
This tool is paid according to usage, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which performs thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the vehicle moons, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional internet sector that allows you to bid on vehicles declared total accident.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or knowing deviations by brands ormodels.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a certain brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of the automobile
The Gt Appraisals Guide is your historical reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at a rate of 20% per annum in the last three years, and in 2008 they invoiced 10.8 million euros.
Early last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and in 1979 settled in Spain.
According to company sources 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange, and now its shares are trading for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Online auction of crashed cars
Last October the Solera group bought Autoonline, an internet platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special accident vehicles.
The transaction amounted to a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, scraps and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market each day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been desused cannot be re-circulated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as a spare part.
Cars of historical value can be discharged even if they have been de-desused after farcific arrangements.
Four-step workshop budget
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, find the spare part, create a budget and generate budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals that to a greater or lesser extent they tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, an internet-connected computer is required to use it.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its rack number, an actual graphical image of the model in question appears, and then the required replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a tidying tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented system does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the client can finance.
The company Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inner face.
