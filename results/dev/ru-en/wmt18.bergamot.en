Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) in the implementation of procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of their obligations by customers in the implementation of state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not receive payment for already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem to special control.
Because businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who concluded contracts that were not backed by financing, tried to evade the borrowed obligations of payment and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the whole country.
Since 2015, 9.7 thousand have been introduced in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders by the Prosecutor's Office. submissions, according to the results of their consideration, 4.5 thousand were brought to disciplinary responsibility. Officials, administrative - 533, to investigative bodies for the organization of procedural inspections presented 75 materials, 46 of them were opened criminal cases.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
And these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of non-payment of multi-billion contracts.
Fable debts were led by numerous, systematic delays in paying for services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
Here is a characteristic case.
The head of a small company won a tender for the provision of services on social transportation for several million rubles.
The person has invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled the obligations, but the money put in time has not received.
The result is an increasing financial person from wage debts, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not apply for help to the prosecutor's office.
Now in some regions the problem was maximally leveled.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, revealed by prosecutors of subjects of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the prosecutor's office operates in the mode of manual anti-crisis management.
The Prosecutor General personally conducts visiting meetings with representatives of the local authorities, on which all the violations and measures for their immediate elimination by prosecutors are thoroughly dealt with.
Such operational meetings were held this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation regarding the establishment of administrative responsibility of the customer's officials for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in the procurement for the provision of state and municipal needs, which was signed by the President of Russia last week.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will complement the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation with an article, which provides for a fine of 30 thousand. up to 50 thousand rubles for violation of the term and order of payment of goods, works and services at state and municipal procurement by the customer.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, he will be disqualified for a period of one year to two years.
All prosecutors of subjects of the Russian Federation have already received instructions to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
A group of civil rights protection announces a warning on travel to Missouri
The National Association for Promotion of the Progress of the Colored Population has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri due to discriminatory policy of the state and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads as follows: "The warning for travelers of the National Association to promote the progress of the colored population, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on African travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly careful and exercise increased caution when traveling the state in connection with a number of dubious incidents on the racist soil, which recently took place throughout the entire territory of the state.
According to the National Association for Promotion of the Progress of the Colored Population, the group has prompted the recently adopted Missouri law to announce a restrictive movement, due to which it became more difficult for people to win claims related to discrimination, as well as the fact that the law enforcement agencies disproportionately often choose their objects of minority representatives.
"You have people who are violated by human rights.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of the skin, they are beaten and killed," said the newspaper "Kanzas-City old-" Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Promotion of the Color Population of Missouri.
We hear complaints often than ever before.
This is the first warning of this kind, announced by the organization in relation to the state of the United States.
The group referred to such incidents as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had ended gasoline during his trip to the state, and the police of Missouri arrested him without making charges of crime.
The warning also mentions the recent report of the General Prosecutor's Office of Missouri, according to which the probability of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 percent higher than for white.
"The purpose of the warning is that people are aware of the situation and warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take with them the money for a pledge or inform relatives that travel through the state.
According to the latest FBI program on hate crimes, in Missouri in 2015 there were 100 hate crimes, which makes the staff sixteenth in the state according to the number of such violations.
Also, the movement warning is a response to the new law of the State of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to initiate a case against a legal entity in connection with housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) issued warnings for travelers in Texas and Arizona after these states adopted new laws of immigration control, according to which local law enforcement agencies were prescribed to arrest people for violation of immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, had to increase the number of racial inspections.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department in relation to other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
Unknown shelled a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters with reference to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Egypt.
During the shooting, two people, including one policeman, were killed, three people were injured.
All wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed people in the car opened fire by law enforcement.
One of the intruders was detained, the second managed to hide.
Rosturizm supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable tickets
The head of the Federal Tourism Agency Oleg Safonov said in an interview to the TV channel RBC that "positively" refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage transportation in non-refundable air tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage, can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage," - he stressed (quotation on TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, you will not have to pay for the carriage of outerwear and mobile phone in hand luggage.
"It would be correct to calm all our citizens and tourists and say this, say that it is to outerwear, to an umbrella, to the mobile phone, to the ipad or even some computer will have no relationship," - said the head of the Federal Tourism Agency.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm on free baggage transportation with a non-refundable air ticket.
It is about the fact that airlines themselves can determine the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-refundable rate.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on the protection of Baikal that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to determine the sources of funding, plans and performers to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full-fledged recultivation of contaminated territories.
RIA Novosti quotes the president as saying: "It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the most of them are worn out."
He also added that the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the appearance of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by the organizers of the recreation.
"I want to emphasize this: not everyone in a row to check, here too, you need to know the measure, but it is - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office announced the reduction of fish stockpiles in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental supervision.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin during the direct line announced the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas of a special regime of protection.
The problems with the conduct of economic activities he was informed by the inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergei Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the borders of the Baikal water protection zone, but the Buryatia government recalled that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulations.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will appear in Ugra
In the village of Sosova, members of the community of indigenous peoples of the North "Rakhtyn," together with residents of Berezovsky district take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location - the river bank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a way for fishermen a way lighthouse.
According to representatives of the community, the construction works will be completed this year, now there are domes installed, there are church bells.
The gaming ECM Fleet provided transport support.
The Church is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, since it is revered by the Orthodox Church as a patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosovo, the fisheries gives the settlers work, feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in school essays about it as a local attraction.
Disneyland with death penalty.
Why do Singapore comply with the laws?
I talk to the local businessman Chang, sitting in the snack shop in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, but rather smolders neatly store in an iron box captured from the office.
After the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - to it a hundred meters - and throws the bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place - 500 local dollars., - reports Chang.
You know, since childhood, I just reflex has worked out: you can not throw a fantik from candy on the pavement, instantly fined.
And now, in general, everywhere video cameras.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, as if in the museum.
Chang says: three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted the graffiti wall of the old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to spanking.
What?!
Imagine.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the buttocks and spent a week in prison.
In general, bodily punishments are not uncommon.
As in Singapore, the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws are combined, the observer of "AiF" was versed on the spot.
No one thinks of abolishing the death penalty here," explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been spitting on the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this issue.
If a person transports a large batch of drugs or trades them, he is put on a gavel.
In 2002. 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport: he brought 400 g of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even Pope Rimsky.
However, the guy in the end still hung.
After that, the drug-couriers our country diligently travel sideways.
The point is: in Singapore, it is necessary that the laws are obliged to comply with ALL in a row, not only modest and poor people.
It doesn't matter who you are a millionaire, Deputy Prime Minister, a well-known artist or a resident of the European Union.
The option is one: if you find a halve of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, just amaze you are given - how many in this city-state of bans!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly according to the recipe (!) doctor.
The tourist on arrival gum will not take away, but it is necessary to glue the "rubber" in the subway, stick a fine of 1 thousand. local dollars.
In four days I met two people with white signs on the neck: "I rubbed."
For thrown by the urns, in addition to a fine, often sentenced to the "link to the wipers": a week to clean parks and beaches.
6 thousand rub. pays a "criminal," who forbade the water in the public toilet, and when trying to cope with a small need in the elevator of the apartment building works a special detector - blocked doors and sent a signal to the police.
Among the very exotic laws - bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of a houseplant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires smokers can not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5 thousand. Singapore bucks.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how old, you will definitely break something.
This is not true at all - trying to assure me Mohammed Kabir-Kadzharia, the owner of a local travel agency.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and over the past twenty years I have not seen someone to be attracted for their violation.
Why do they keep?
That citizens do not relax.
Observance of the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if a minor sells cigarettes in a kiosk, everything will be punished on the chain: the store owner will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will receive sticks on the "back part," and the seller will also be put in prison and put in jail.
It is thanks to such severe law of offense in Singapore that is very rare.
Is this justified?
In the seventies we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, went as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for a year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows: if stopped, the policeman will not let go for a bribe, impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years will be sent for a grid.
Many foreigners in Southeast Asia seem to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993. American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States has terrified the total wealth of residents, "frightening clean airport" and "cultured nature."
Say, such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and surely scare to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, catch if you go in the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the area "Little India," and suddenly - "break of the template": at the bus stop lying plastic cups.
"What about it?" - You wonder.
But so, - grin the Singaporeans.
Every thing happens.
Not for every such "crime" will catch on the spot, but you must know: if you are calculated, do not anoint - because you have violated the law.
Most often this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But do you know what?
In the Vietnam Ho Chi Minh city, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
In the heart of Paris is full of dirty homeless and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage into the urns.
Singapore, thanks to the set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws became the quietest, clean and safe city on Earth.
You think about it.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia no one was fastened behind the wheel until they began to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with laws.
And we must think that in Russia people in Russia would also be happy with clean streets, the lack of garbage in the subway and welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Here are bodily punishments - thank you, do not.
In the rest of the laws of Singapore at least cost to look at them.
Nothing saint?
Now Trump's White House has now targeted the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it begins to fight statues.
The Americans understand this as much as everyone else - hence the deliberately theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologists of Trump's government, undoubtedly knew what he was doing when he had made a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Akosta about the president's proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
We will be honest, Miller did not attempt the statue itself.
The hordes of the owners of promenade boats and artists, depicting the Statue of Liberty, would lynch it if he tried to do so.
But he tried her sense, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when Emma Lazarus's verses were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at the Akost: "I don't want to go into history here deeply, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller correctly explained the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really about history.
This is about the present sound of the astonishing words of Lazarus, the only one in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / Unhappy wastes of your abundant shores."
Never before have "unprivate wastes" been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literature - he made it clear that Trump is not waiting for these people in America.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is really a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who fought to put her words on the basement of the statue after her death, - understood very well that they were doing a completely political act.
The sculpture was supposed to denote the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - a female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she received a completely different name: The Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of the poem and the image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, though the right ones change it back.
The gloomy Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist, who announced Trump's coming, argued in 2010 that Freedom did not invite anyone, rather she - the early neoconservative, carrying the flame of America lying in the darkness of the world: "Freedom goes forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to illuminate the path in the United States."
Against the custom of Limbo here really got to the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus's great creative achievement was to see her as she would have been seen by the exhausted, unhappy, but full of hopes on the decks of the ships after long and often heavy sailing.
This means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue is answered by words of hope and hospitality, which they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch is needed not to illuminate the path, but to kindle hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake appreciates the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eilid Doyle recalls the time when there were only two Scots in the UK
Neil Blake, Director of the Athletics Federation of the UK Athletics Federation, said that a of 16 people, the Scottish part of the national team at the World Cup will make a "significant contribution to the game of the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the beginning of Friday London Championship 2017.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special" and the Athletics Federation of Great Britain should take this into account.
"We know this and try to understand and will support as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I talked to people at the Scotland Sports Institute and they think it's due to what they've done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they have done, it is necessary to work.
British Athletics Federation: with what they did, it is necessary to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why circumstances have arisen so, but it's quite brilliant."
Some of the Scottish athletes claim medals, including Laura Mourre and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Fach at a distance of 5000 meters; and Eilid Doyle the team chose his captain.
"Eilid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," says Blake.
"Many athletes, whether they are Scots or not, and from where they live or train, left this room, feeling pride and mood to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eylid had put in it were remarkable."
The winner of the silver medal of the Commonwealth Championship, which at its fifth World Championship will run a distance of 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 Scots in the British national team - it is "unbelievable."
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Championships was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Ahead is Laura Muer, specializing in the middle-distance race and beaten last year five British and two European records.
It will run for 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will participate in the 1500m race, is another Scotsman, who should pay attention: behind him he has a successful season, which was victories in the qualifying competition of the British national team and the Annual competitions.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup, when besides her the only Scotsman in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she is "unbelievably proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will qualify for medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the national team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a great honor in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you chose - for me it is a very special thing," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who entered the national team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all - held athletes, who will seek to get on the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Yes, I think she was not bad.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to take home World Cup.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from fans and take advantage of what we will again be at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful. "
Blocking critics on Facebook: you don't have to go to a public position if you are not ready to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, irritated.
But he did not shut his mouth with his critics.
As far back as 1783, Washington said: "It is possible to take away the freedom of speech and us, the deaf and dumb, will lead as sheep to the slaughter."
Now I'll go over to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should have tried to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties sued him for it.
The subordinate governors called this claim insignificant, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But this is also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to Hogan-like guys.
He is a surprisingly popular republican governor in a democratic state.
He is in second place in the rating of approval among 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stuck reactionary.
He demonstrated a firm hand in state management and commitment to his principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as a primary way of liaison with his voters and with jokes demonstrates his head bald after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the Governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and is conducted by the administration staff on taxpayers' money - it is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Amelia Ches, spokesman, defending the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments is just their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and hitters who are malicious on the Internet.
The "post" spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, businessman, pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
Pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan - Catholic.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Raman from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by the lack of his reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the section of comments to the article in Post.
"I also do not like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say that it is a so-called recruitment, instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of dissatisfied citizens."
The fact that the subordinate governors call "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call "an active life position."
In the era, Facebook is easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before, when it was necessary to send people, collect and burn newspapers with critical leaders or arrest and shut the mouth of the protesters.
But this is exactly what is happening now, only in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned on his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge from Alexandria James K. Kasheris, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the county Laudon violated the First Amendment by banning the voter in his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bavin complained about the American Union for the protection of civil liberties for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
At Washington's time, the era of available postal expenses made about the same coup as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters severely collapsed his authority.
And even then Washington dealt with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Yurikol," "Valerius," "Belizarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online project "Docifications of Washington," his cabinet was blocked by petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he did not try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreement with it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for household amenities in the club 'Renaissance'
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for everyday conveniences for the next three days, when the club "Renaissance" in East Lotian will take the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who was the leader in the club "Archerfield Links," and moved in the direction of the final round last year, until he lost Paul Ilsu, attached to the new place and serves as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the club Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it comes to success with this event," said Rafferty.
The players will see this field at his best moment, it is in a magnificent state.
Jerry did a great job, organizing this place.
He is an ardent adherent to this game and is proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field.
The Englishman Ils is looking forward to defending the championship title for the first time, despite the fact that he won both the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's really a special feeling," said the player from Southport.
"I failed to try to re-coupe the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Return to this corner of the world - magically.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back, and for me and my wife Sharon was a very special impression to win last year.
It was indeed a special time, and we shall always remember it.
Returns to the fight on the native land of Gary Orr, joined the European tournament for senior athletes after he turned 50 earlier this year.
The event will be the first public to appear in Scotland with the time of the tournament Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Opena in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a bit more important," said the inhabitant of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden.
I played with great pleasure again and I showed a good golf.
I am pleased with all things that are so far.
On the field to this trio will join the former winner of the tournament "Masters Ian Vusun and champions of majors for senior athletes Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chepman, Mark James and Mark McNalti.
Orr and the former captain of the "Ryder Cup" Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmaire and Ross Drammond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs 5 pounds per hour if one person in the car, and 10 pounds if two or more.
All revenues go to the British prostate cancer fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
The peculiar tunnels above the highways, capable of absorbing carbon oxide thrown by cars, are already being tested on the roads of the UK.
The transport agency of the country, according to the publication Autocar, reported on the positive results of the test of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-metre high-rise tunel is built of some new polymer materials that are able to absorb the harmful substances contained in automotive exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce the road flow, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and upgrade the park of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all pollution of the atmosphere is on transport, and the unsatisfactory air quality becomes the cause of up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moscow City Court changed punishment to disabled Mamayev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the sentence to the disabled Anton Mamaev, convicted of four and a half years in a penal colony, to a fine of 200,000. rub.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the term with a suspended sentence, explaining its request that Mamayev's disease "prevents his stay in prison conditions."
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a penal colony for a robbery, the victim of which was a former Special Forces fighter.
On July 19, the court released a man from custody at the polling station in pre-trial detention.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian land of gold."
When preparing dinner, Bardin Degei does not use the stove.
She even uses a pot rarely.
In his wooden house in Enaratali, the capital of Paniai district in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which is called "Honata", right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred bell tower is taken out and eat impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the earthen floor - she has no furniture, and it is here that she does her work at home, such as washing clothes with muddy water from the located swamp.
The room serves as a bucket in the room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and therefore she was not instructed to work in the field.
Mivinity here is common.
Of course, working until late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are also soldiers.
"No one decides to walk around the village after five evenings," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at the daily life in the top of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote publicly, raising their hands in front of the occupying troops.
The existing movement, which advocates independence from the Netherlands, quickly turned its anger against the government of Jakarta, which retains severe control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and the Western Pope, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarolali is the city as remote as the abandoned; the road here includes an hour and a half flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, in Nabirus, and then a five-hour shaking on a hand car.
There is no public transport here.
A city with a population of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses, surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel painted rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few of Indonesians, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners got here.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries Papuas la the pago worshiped God by the name of Uga Tayy.
There were other changes.
"We were unusual to wear this clothes," Degei says, showing his bright, hand-weted turban, dark skirt and a bright shirt.
"Previously we wore only leaves on the body.
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28% of its population lives beyond poverty, and child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it is also the Indonesian golden land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, located in Phoenix, is located in the Phoenix company "Freeport McMoran," is only sixty miles from Pania, a mountainous province of approximately the size of New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
Only in 2015 the company "Freeport" produced here gold and copper for about 3.1 billion dollars.
In addition, Papua can boast of forest reserves, the cost of which is estimated at 78 billion dollars.
These wealth, however, entails one misfortune for the Popes, ensuring that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia retain their suffocating presence here.
According to the New York Times investigation in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, the company "Freeport" paid almost $20 million to local servicemen and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The requirements of the greater autonomy by Papuas threaten the existence of this golden vein and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969 more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed by the Indonesian military, and thousands have been raped, subject to torture and deprived of liberty.
According to the Asian Commission for Human Rights, mass murders in the native inhabitants of the Pope in the seventies of the Pope in the seventies can be considered a genocide.
Only last year, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose all," published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese, contains evidence of the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture - especially frequents, as stated in another report, rape and electric shock - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because the incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, who is engaged in research in Indonesia for the Human Rights Watch.
The drawers lingered, as Papua's resources attracted the influx of immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5-million population of the province consists of Christians, but demographic indicators change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands - Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan benches, ?varungi, sell roasted chicken and a mixture of vegetables ?gado-gado, served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to withstand competition.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market than the natives of Papua," explains Abet Jou, a twenty-four-year-old native of Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, because of the work.
"Because of this, the natives of Papua - mother-mama (women) Papua - lost their market sales.
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known among the people as Djokovi, swore to engage in inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter got the support of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel loyal.
Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Djokovi, expecting that he will fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice," says Jou.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration of Djokovi Panaya survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street and sang Christmas anthems near the fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
Frightened children told them that they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended at their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were chasing the children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers fired at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Eimo, was so beaten so much that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone squeezed the government building of the election commission, which was not far away, and the next day the situation became worse.
About a thousand Papuas men, women and children gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed a wave, the dance of the papuas tribe than the phouldge: they ran around and portrayed bird singing.
Some protesters began to throw stones into the police station and military base.
When the situation was heated, the soldiers on the internal radio communication were ordered: "If the crowd has resisted more than three times, shoot them - so it sounded, as stated in the official document, which was seen by the correspondents of the magazine TIME, but which was not published in the local media.
The fifty-six-year-old Eremias Kayame, the head of the district of Kygo Koto in Enarotali, felt the approach of danger and called for peace, addressing the crowd with a request to disperse at home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned, I suddenly got into my left wrist," he told the magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayama still does not know who was shooting, but he says that the bullet flew from the ranks of the soldiers gathered.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he adds.
The local resident of Alfius Jouva hit three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it is," Johanes told the journal dying gloomily, who, like many Indonesians, enjoys only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.
General Yotge Mende, senior police inspector Papua, told reporters that his officers were just defending their base because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the police representative of Papua, Commissioner Pujo Sulistico in 2015.
It is a matter of life and death.
According to the data of the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news about the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi said an ardent speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and swore to deal with the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be settled immediately, so that it will never be repeated again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security Viranto said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately went excuses.
"Most of the violations occurred long ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or at the beginning of zero.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be done, - he said.
Then Viranto gave up his words, speaking with the magazine "TIME" on June 5 in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to consider complaints to Papua.
Instead he said, "All things will be done through judgment."
Viranto, whom the United Nations accused of crimes against humanity in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already settled, including the incident in Pania.
The Pania's victims" families met such statements with gloomy distrust.
"During the last three years I was asked four times, but there have been absolutely no changes," says Johanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid that the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobbus also expressed the opinion that the residents of Pania are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he had been beaten by the military after he had helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired at villagers in the neighboring Paniai District Deiyai.
During the clash between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and another 17 were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Daw, who drowned while catching fish in a river flowing in a river, died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the construction site owned by the company.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who in response made warning shots.
But the locals claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation," said the magazine TIME, twenty-nine-year-old Dominga Badiya, who lives near the hospital and saw how hastily delivered the wounded.
"I have been hiding at home for two days."
The Parliament of Deiai demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to be answered, and the mobile police brigade was withdrawn from this region.
Pinai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development causes dissatisfaction with the tribes of Mey, moni, tribute and a dam, scattered throughout the greened central mountainous areas of Papua.
Many have joined the "Driving for the Free Papua" (OPM), the rebel army, which claims to defend the rights of the Popes by being satisfied with sporadic attacks and raids with kidnapping people on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top executives of OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yoga and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
Thousands of people have been arrested and unfoundedly detained by the military under the pretext of protection of national independence in Pania in recent years.
Some did not return.
Among the population of Papua Paniai is considered a bakery, forgotten place.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for local residents.
Bread to the same degree is definitely inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly, notes, as well as some fruits and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of which can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually retain most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten tubers of note are only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality between indigenous Papuas and new migrants has increased, which arrived in large quantities after the introduction of new flights to Nabie Airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually given to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuas rarely have enough money or necessary skills to lead their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... "Such as there is no work, no money," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain tough.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Eskyudi and Basel Lonshan were deported from Papua for insufficient coordination with the relevant organizations, despite the fact that they were given rare permission to conduct video recording.
According to Felim Kine, Asia's Deputy Director for Asia, the promises given during the election campaign of Djokovi, to abolish the restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists, trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and the Western Pope, face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of media attention means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is mainly limited by the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tong, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - appealed to the UN Human Rights Council with a request to investigate the "diversific and widespread violations" in Papua, including shooting in Pania.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
Representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia Arramanata Nasir waved away from the statement of the group, informing journalists in Jakarta that the "in Indonesian still has a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide the evidence of human rights violations.
The locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Dutch Human Rights Ambassador Kiis Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the locals broke the silence, praying: "We want freedom," as the source states, who also attended the meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but Papopaas say that it is unlikely to vote again for Djokovi.
"Jockows" is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in shooting in Paniai," says Gobai, chairman of the council of the tribe.
He wants Djokovi to know that Paniai residents, except that they are in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are immersed in poverty, and education and health care they have in a pitiful state.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papuas, consider their voice, given for Djokovi, the duty that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of shooting in Pania brought to execution the last symbolic act of disobedience: buried the body of one of the victims on the plot of land directly opposite the police and military section.
Knowing that justice will probably never triumph, they at least will not allow the guilty to forget about their crimes.
"Killed a member of our family," says Jacobus, without lifting his head.
"What else did we have to do?
The fire covers the Dubai skyscraper for the second time.
The fire encompassed one of the world's highest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to hurriedly leave the seventy-nine-storey structure of 337 meters.
This is the second fire, which was carried through the high-rise building, which is called "Fakel" - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no human casualties were reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to come down from the fifties," said the resident of George, who called George to the agency.
According to the Civil Defense Department of Dubai, firefighters extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government has reported that it is working on the provision of asylum to the victims.
The incident can return to the agenda the security of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the administration of "Fakela" after the fire there in 2015 it turned out that the most affected was the plating of the external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said that the system of isolation and plattering panels of the building Greenfell Tower in London could accelerate the spread of the fire there in June, as a result of which about 80 people died.
The growth of the tourist flow to Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
As follows from the data that the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee received in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, the services of hotel companies in the North-East used a total of 20 519 local and foreign tourists, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, and foreign - increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12 525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the region the number of Russian tourists - by 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from Russia stayed in Ida-Virumaa hotels.

Five Military Killed in Afghanistan in Car Explosion
At least five servicemen were killed during an explosion in the Afghan province of Gilmend, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the police, the night before near the military checkpoint in Girisch county exploded car mined.
We know of 20 dead.
On Friday morning in Girischka there was a new emergency.
Armed criminals attacked the exchange office.
The skirmish between the attackers and the security forces continues.
The diver shot a shark on a video of his biting camera
Divever and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) captured the video of the shark, which bit his action-camera GoPro.
The video posted on Facebook a division of the American Maritime Fishing Agency in Massachusetts, whose employee is the Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape-Code Peninsula in the northeast of the United States, Necn specified.
The man during the scuba diving tried to shoot the shark on the camera, which was held on a special stick.
Seeing a person, the animal has sailed to it with a length of more than three meters.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
The collal explained that the predator acted in this way to determine whether the gadget is edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of the marine animal was for scientists in a novelty.
The reason for the mass brawl at the Urals military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived to the Elan Training Center, where a mass brawl took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this fight have already become known.
According to the public Mash, which appeared on the VKontakte page, contract servicemen of the Ural military unit number 31612 brutally fought because of the unfilled bed.
It all began with the fact that the private name of the Sayan demonstratively ignored the order of the officer to refill the sticking sheet.
The officers from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Sayan supported the first company.
In half an hour 140 young guys were defeated in the barracks of the bed and sinks, knocked out the windows.
More than ten people were injured in a mass brawl.
The Central Military District denied the information about the ponozhovshchina.
The study showed that at least one fifth of passengers in the United States carry prohibited items on the plane.
The study showed that more than 20 percent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried in their baggage on board the aircraft through the U.S. Transport Security Administration checkpoints prohibited items, including at least 6 percent landed on the plane, having prohibited knives or other sharp items.
Almost 1 percent reported that later they found that they accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covered by more than 1000 people, also showed that young passengers are more inclined to violate the rules.
Among the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly with something that is prohibited by ATP, 19.7 percent were millenniums compared to less than 15 percent of members of the generation X.
Consciously past the staff of ATP most often carry food and water.
More than 3 percent admitted that they specifically carried out sharp objects through inspection, and 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted that they deliberately carried prohibited medicines into the plane.
The company said that it studied passengers across the country to find out how many of them accidentally carried smuggling through airports, and how much they did it consciously.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - drag smuggling through the inspection of those who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATP rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantity.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATP could be considered prohibited for transportation of books.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA Head Pruitt refuses to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama to reduce emissions
The day after the lawsuit of 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama, designed to reduce the emissions of substances that pollute the air and lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that now his agency is more than in previous administrations, listening to the needs of regulators of environmental protection of individual states.
He did not mention the claim against his previous position, filed in the federal appellate court.
The dispute turned around the period of October 1, to which the states should ensure compliance with the standards of 2015 on the ozone at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that it would postpone their compliance for one year to give its department more time to study the plan and avoid "non-compliance with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
Pruitt, who, before being appointed President Trump for his current position, was the Prosecutor General of Oklahoma State, was long known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental norms.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of norms that were opposed to the chemical or gas-oil industry.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Piitt to return to the same standards.
Last month, the US Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the head of the EPA exceeded his powers, trying to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by the Obama administration, requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that by changing the course on ozone standards, he simply fulfilled the obligation of EPA to cooperate with the states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of new standards.
"In previous EPA administrations often could not meet in time, then waited for complaints from groups of activists and from other persons and discussed the terms in the course of the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who filed more claims against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through court trials, and we take the set deadlines seriously.
We also take our statutes and the power he gives us seriously."
However, the EPA statement says that Pruitt may reuse his "authorities to delay and other legal powers" at some point to make sure that the norms of "jcyjjdfys on a clear course and all available information."
Republicans in Congress insist on a broader revision of the rules relating to ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the rules of 2015 for at least eight years.
The Senate has not voted on this issue yet.
New York Prosecutor General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said that the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The change of the EPA course - after our claims is an important victory in the fight for health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who were directly affected by the smog, covering their cities," Schneiderman said.
The claim of New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaver, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
The ozone at the ground level occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants and other sources enters the atmosphere in response with sunlight.
The resulting from this could cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change of Pruitt's course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it was needed to achieve this completely logical step from a man who is instructed to protect the air we breathe," said Laurie Beard from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and the protection of those who pollute the air and their special interests."
IAAF Congress Extends Removal of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted for the extension of the removal of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, the Congress supported the IAAF Board to restore the VFLA, which issued a report on Monday, in which it recommended to leave the expulsion in force.
For the extension of the withdrawal voted 166 people, against - 21, reports TASS.
The IAAF Board report said that VFLA has made significant progress to achieve the conditions established by the Council for the Restoration of Membership, but these conditions have not been fully met yet.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Cup in London, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the championship IAAF.
VFLA was subjected to perpetual disqualification by IAAF in 2015.
Then a report of an independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which spoke about numerous violations of the WADA regulations, admitted by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the latest report of the IAAF Board in the article "IAAF has extended sanctions against VFLA."
Insulting defeat
As part of the 3 rounds of the Fonbet-Pervenities of Russia among the teams of the New York "Khimik" held a trip match against FC "Kaluga."
A little more than 10 days ago, rivals played among themselves in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" did not give way to the opponent, but a second relaxation at the end of the match led to a grievous goal and fiasco.
After a recent defeat from the Kalugians with a score of 0:3, many predicted in advance the easy victory of the owners.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the New Yorkers forced themselves to take into account and acted from defense, but from a position of force.
In 1 half Kaluga more created and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexei Sirotin, who several times reflected dangerous blows and his actions gave partners confidence.
Unfortunately, the attack "Chemistry" lacked effort and luck to impasse the defense of "Kalugi" and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to take place on counter courses.
Novomoskovskians more actively played in the attack.
Anxiety ringings for our team were mistakes in defense, which allowed the Kalugaans to create a number of sharp moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, "Khimik" intercepted the territorial advantage and conducted several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaluzhan played its role - they more competently and cold-bloodedly held the ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, "Chemist" moved the ball to the corner, serving which the owners of the field without resistance moved to the goal.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemist" demonstrated a good game, but suffered a grievous defeat.
Ahead of our team is waiting for another trip - August 11 at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov New Yorkers will compete with the favorite of the group "Center" FC "Ararat," which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come to support "Chemist!"
Place and time of meeting of New Yorkers - 18 hours. 30 min. near Magnolia store (East, d.2, corp.).
The composition "Chemistry": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romaschenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogya (Oreshkin), Dudati, Ryzhi, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to the published transcripts of telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico about paying the wall on the border
The newspaper "Washington Post" published the transcripts of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with the president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieta Trump insisted that he would stop publicly claiming that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The U.S. President scolded him for publicly speaking against the wall, and, according to leaked information, he told him: "You can't say this to the press."
Trump started his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that will make Mexico pay for the project.
In the published interpretation of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Ternbull also found a hot altercation.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement, according to which the United States should accept refugees traveling to Australia, is ridiculous, disgusting and ultukope, and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, it would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump completed the conversation, saying Ternbul, that it was the most unpleasant conversation for the whole day.
The bodies of tourists killed in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The aircraft belonging to the airline "Russia," on board which are the bodies of Russians killed in Abkhazia, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
On the site of the final point of the board will meet employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the City Hall, told journalists Deputy Minister of Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamir Akhba.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the republic said that all the expenses, which are associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia, took over the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed its readiness to pay the relatives of tourists killed as a result of explosions flights and accommodation in the republic, but relatives sent only a power of attorney to the republic to the right of the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky Gudautsky district in the warehouse of missile-artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the republic thundered two explosions, after which they began to detonate large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there.
As a result, there was a ignition of the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency killed two citizens of Russia - Elena Polyakova born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were brought to medical institutions of the republic with injuries of varying degrees of severity.
Currently, there are seven people in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
A big jury will take up studying the Russian influence on the U.S. elections
Russia's Special Prosecutor Robert Muller convened a large jury in Washington, which will study the influence of Russia on the election of the US president in 2016, according to The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be studied by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are enough to charge.
The convocation of a large jury gives MBller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury board, which started the work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son of the presidential candidate Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016, previously promised Muller himself.
They have already been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. previously said that from the meeting with Veselnitskaya he waited for compromising the headquarters of the candidate from PDM Hillary Clinton, but no exposing documents were presented, and it was finally about adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that Trump's statement Jr. about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump senior.
The White House specified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which would be done by any father.

Murder Mors Ford: Activists will lose Lynch's trials on stage to call for justice
Ford Mercury, 1948, passed the audience in the village of Monroe in Georgia and roared to the small bridge Mors Ford.
When the car, in which there were four black passengers and a white driver, came to the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main man - middle-aged man in a thin strip suit - lingered with a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those who sat inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" "The man snarled."
"Put it out of the car!"
The piercing screams tore the silence when the young black man was pulled out from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a scenery.
But when Roger's neck was thrown a loop, almost all the spectators really held their breath.
Since 2005, the activists have returned to the bridge Mors Ford to re-locate the night when in 1946 the dollslane lynched two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted for these murders.
"It's amazing that during all these years no man has been arrested - although we see them next to us; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a spot on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
The 71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgian Congress, who fights for human rights all his life.
For him, the performance is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the residents of Monroe that the injustice has not been corrected.
"We want investigation, we want to finish, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must achieve justice," he says.
"We cannot go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
Coroner covers a sheet body of one of the victims of lynching at Mors Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI obtained by En-Bi-Si News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in the lynching.
But no one was charged.
Although suspected of decades remained free, human rights activists say that the city has always known two related motives of lynchingers: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court decision for the first time allowed black citizens to vote for primaries, which were to take place that summer.
Approximately during the same election, according to the FBI, the black man Roger Malcolm hit Barnett Hester's knife in a fight, a white landowner - in a kindness, because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to be born was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landlord, paid a pledge of $ 600 bail to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they rode out of the prison and came up to the bridge of Mors Ford, the crowd of lynchers surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," this conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
"It is also obvious that there was a collusion between the law enforcement agencies of the state and the city, which not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed the evidence and hid the identity of witnesses."
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt to vote," he says.
"They were killed to send a signal to black men in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same."
For almost ten years, Kassandra Green has been leading an annual performance that reproduces the lynching at the bridge Mors Ford.
Her performance is visual, he captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism, which, as many would like to count, is no longer in America.
It is difficult to look at him and turn away even harder, but Green believes that this is the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I have experienced."
The rehearsals of this year began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest of the black - gathered in the room and listened to a review of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but he says that the role has not become easier.
"I think I've got dirty because it's not the man I'm," Marbo says.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to return at that time."
In the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectacle begins with the fact that Malcolm, furious about the fact that Hester sleeps with his wife Dorothy, screams and pushes him.
"I said, nowhere, get out of my house!"
Screams the Rascon in response.
A blow is being distributed.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are terrified by laughter.
Green laughs the loudest of all.
"What is" - Asks Ascona.
He is concerned and embarrassed.
I'm overplaying?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites were saying "niga'."
"Yes, "- laughs one of the black performers.
"You must be borne a solid 'r'."
And the energy in the room also changes: discomfort is replaced by the feeling of partnership.
Everyone has to do everything correctly, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of four killed people.
The scene begins first.
This time, when the Rascona speaks the word for the letter "H," it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The performance ends cruelly and quickly.
Cries, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of actors and performs the sad song of Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted through the word.
In a hundred yards from her fifty spectators wipe tears and pomp.
Among the audience is almost equal number of black and white.
One couple came from Soby, New York to see the performance; many live very close.
They all had a heavy spirit of Georgia for almost eight hours while Brooks was driving them into the pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the killings remained only history, but now that they are at the same place where people swear, it seems that their ghosts are immediately in the air.
When the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and immobile bodies, and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," mutters one little boy, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly everything ends.
The actors throw ropes off the neck and wipe tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, a man in a costume that played the main doll.
Nick Rascon embraces two other actors and suddenly, weeping, falls into their embrace: the emotional load of the performance finally hit him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You have had reasons for this."
Later, the audience sit down to have dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta is actively discussing the play with a black pair, which they just met.
Denise Daplinski hardly searches for words to describe what she feels after the performance.
"It is hard to listen to these terrible, terrible words, and actions... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think that lynching is still happening," she adds, "only now it's called the police that the police are shooting."
In another corner of the room, Tayron Brooks took full attention, who remembers his work as a human rights defender for food.
He says that he has already begun to plan the presentation of the next year.
"The production encourages us, because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it may happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."
The court fined Navalny for violations of the "agitation work day"
The Simonovsky Court of Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300,000. rubles for violation of the order of organization of meeting.
Opposition activist was found guilty of an administrative offense under Part. 8 st. 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offenses of the Russian Federation "Repeated violation of the order of organization of meeting."
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky Court of Moscow Khyzyr Mussakaev finished considering an administrative case against Leonid Volkov - the head of the staff of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000. rubles.
Judge Mssaakayev assessed the distribution of leaflets on the "agitational cleanup," which Navalny's supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Seeing the agit materials that followed the participants of the cleanup, the police found that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to pre-require permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuyev requested the termination of administrative proceedings due to the lack of corpus delicti and pointed out that the police allowed certain mistakes in drawing up the protocol.
At the very "agitation workday" Volkov was not detained, but he received an agenda that obliges him to come to the police department to tell about the event held with his active participation.
The same agenda was received by Navalny himself and another oppositionist - Nikolai Lyaskin.

"Pirson" cuts another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to return the business to life
On Friday, the British educational group of companies "Pirson" announced that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72% due to the beginning of another restructuring program aimed at combating the problems faced by their business.
These jobs reductions, which, according to John Fallon's CEO, will mainly occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, are added to 4,000 jobs that were reduced during the previous restructuring.
"Pirson" announced that it plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) in May during the third cost reduction program to try to return to life a business that hit a rapid transition to digital learning methods.

Attack on convoy in Kabul: Soldier Nato died as a result of an assassination
According to information received from official sources, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, as the NATO statement reads.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the Karabakh region.
This explosion is the last of the bloodshed of Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday as a result of the explosion in the mosque in Gerate killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion that took place on Thursday evening happened when a joint convoy with the army of Afghanistan was attacked with the help of a man-bearing self-made explosive device.
According to the report, all the wounded are in a stable state and receive treatment in the American military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for NATO forces deployed in Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017 in Afghanistan there were at least 1662 civilian casualties, and about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, the bombing of the suicide bomber on the car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia district in Kabul.
Taliban said that they made the attack.
On May 31, as a result of a powerful explosion in the city center, more than 150 people were killed - this is the most serious terrorist attack in the country since the troops under the leadership of the United States in 2001 were removed from power by the troops under the leadership of the United States.
Violence accentuates the unsustainable situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether it is necessary to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting the troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the attacks in Kabul, which took place over the past weeks, also created a crisis of public trust in the government, its lines of conduct, and especially to the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency after lawsuits cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the law on air pollution
The US Environmental Protection Agency has abolished the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama era law, according to which states should limit emissions that pollute the air, a day after 15 states sued the agency because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called ozone measurements - 2015, stressing that this step shows the agency's readiness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness towards them," said Scott Pruitt, Head of the Environmental Protection Agency, in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environmental Protection Agency to postpone the measurement of ozone, in which the existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced, so that it meets the stricter standards of air cleanliness, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the Federal District of Columbia filed a lawsuit stating that this intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to roll back a wide range of decisions concerning the protection of the environment introduced by the previous President Barack Obama, within a broader program aimed, according to Trump, on brilliant economic growth.
But the actions in this direction caused resistance from the democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on the health of the population.
The website of the Environmental Protection Agency says that the use for breathing air containing ozone, can worsen the function of the lungs and enhance respiratory symptoms, for example, asthma.
Association of European Businesses Opposes New Anti-Russian Sanctions
The Association of European Businesses expressed disagreement with the US economic sanctions against Russia.
According to AEB, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement says that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so it is impossible to limit the principles of free trade.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of states and governments of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow to separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to limit the movement on the embankment in Pskov
Pskov people's elected sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the city Sergey Surin about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Great River.
Members of the City Duma Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Veverkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, the control of drivers will help to make this territory more calm and safe.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the signs "Pedestrian track" and freely ride along the waterfront.
It turns out that the overhaul and improvement were carried out in vain.
Sports and playgrounds because of the cars become uncomfortable.
According to the Pskov information agency, in the evenings the central embankment is patrolled by employees of the motor-tair of the teaching staff and guards.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes smaller, but the entire movement does not stop.

The Head of State added that it is impossible to "create conditions that hinder the continuation of the enterprise until the impossibility of paying taxes."

Mike Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasily Lomachenko and Mike Garcia, who, apparently, are steadily moving to hold the most exciting match in boxing weight up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, while Garcia, the undefeated champion in light weight of the World Boxing Council, walked along the corridor to greet Lomachenko, World Boxing Organization champion in the second light weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over Erien Broner's former world champion in four weight categories on Saturday, both boxers are among the top five boxes, regardless of the weight category.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How is it, champion?"
Good luck to you.
Lomachenko defends his belt in a duel with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on the channel ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be just right.
"I used to be in the light weight," said Garcia.
I went up to the category for Broner's sake [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not so large.
I am not enough for 140.
I want to go down to the light.
And he needs to rise to the half-legal [up to 135 pounds], and then we will arrange a fight.
This is what fans want.
Let us give them this.
Lomachenko agreed.
"Box needs this fight."
Climas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy he adheres to Lomachenko to make his debut fight in weight 135 this year later this year to appoint a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in fighting with the winner of the fight between Jorge Linares and Luc Campbell after the title of the world champion in September.
"The fight can be on the PPV, because all the fans asked for it," said Garcia, expressing later the willingness to fight on the channel, which will offer the best financial conditions.
We are the main names.
No other names will cause such interest.
As soon as they are ready...
Garcia said that Lomachenko thinks the stunning boxer and maybe visit his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia praise and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three weights from Riverside looks very slow, forgive, Mike... you asked for a knockout.
Garcia said he focused on showing the strength of the strike, and then the boxing.
They both said they felt the tension before their own fight.
This battle must take place.
No other battle is so much interest and conversation.
"I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: I waited for one of the top boxers, and here he, Mike.
It will be a great battle.

New results of tests to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden published
The latest results of the test of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not everyone trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Forensic Agency (RitsmediciverT) began to conduct tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make an assessment of age in the asylum process more accurately, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized for failing to determine the real age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
At the moment, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Judicial Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as people 18 years or older, and in another 25 cases, the Judicial Medicine Agency assessed that the test was probably 18 years old or older.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is likely to be less than 18.
Tests are conducted only in cases where the age of a person is doubtful.
According to Johan Geransson of the Forensic Agency, the results are in line with the results for the past months.
We do not see a big difference with statistics for the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate," he said to the portal "The Local."
The high proportion of cases in which people were valued as 18 years of age do not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, most likely, the age of the tested is 18 years or more.
However, having considered 581 published results, the newspaper "Svenska Dagbladet" found that in 243 cases, a person openly stated that 18 he will be executed this year.
The method of medical evaluation of age, which is to make the X-ray of wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and give them for analysis to dentists and radiographs, also caused criticism in some authorities.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Karoline Institute, Claude Markus, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have passed through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I have had reasons to think about it, and I don't think you need to use the methods of measurement that are being used now.
Biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can't determine it with confidence, we shouldn't pretend to be," he said to the newspaper.
However, Geranssen from the Forensic Agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, we can say that the risk of mistakenly take the child for an adult is small.
We face the biggest risk when a person will soon be 18, in this case, he is about 10 percent.
I will think whether to run for president
During his working visit to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin assured that he is ready to think whether to run for president in 2018, Interfax reports.
This statement was a reaction to the request of residents of the village Cheremushki in Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential elections will be held, we all ask you to run for this post again."
"Well, I'll think, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, Russian President's spokesman Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements by some media outlets that Vladimir Putin's campaign headquarters will be headed by Anton Vaino, head of the presidential administration.
Peskov called these assumptions "not based on anything, hypothetical reasoning."
Peskov said: "As long as there are no staffs, until the creation of staffs is far from being, it is far from the election campaign."
"Until it is on the agenda," said Peskov.
Western Virginia Governor Says He's Moving to Another Party
Western Virginia Governor Jim Justis announced on Thursday during a meeting with President Trump, which moves into another party.
"You like it or not, but the democrats have distanced myself from me," said Governor Justis.
"Today I tell you with many prayers and many reflections... Today I tell you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you, remaining a democrat governor.
The rally exploded with applause.
"That's why tomorrow I'll change my registration to the Republican," Justis added.
"As a coach, I would tell you that the time to play differently."
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement will be made at the meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a margin of 42%, and Justis did not support the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justis, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited coal business from his father.
Its fortune is estimated at $ 1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party on Thursday evening issued a statement that the "Transition of Governor Justis to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere with the fact that it is working to make our country a great one again.
"Given only 15 governors and control over the least number of state legislatures in history, the statement of the governor Justis is just another rejection of the party, which has no leaders from above to bottom and is not able to find a positive, unifying message," said the representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party Ronna McDaniel in a statement of CBS News.
The cat heavyweight nicknamed Mr. Krashavchik found the house thanks to social networks
The pet of Pittsborough (North Carolina, USA) has built a cat named Mr. Beauties weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
It is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a cat photo was published in the pet's account on Facebook asking to find its owner, because "he was clearly someone who used to feed."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's face can become a new meme.
The publication gained more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15 thousand comments.
In the comments dozens of people expressed their desire to shelter Mr. Krashavchik.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to deal with his excess weight.
In an interview with the radio WNCN American said that she had already had such an experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs a little more than five.
In July, Reddit users paid attention to the cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
The post with a photograph of the animal collected more than 68 thousand views.
The commentators noted that she could well make a career in the model business.
Cove praised Shchisren's apology of Russia in connection with the doping scandal
International Athletics specialist Sebasian Cove praised on Thursday what he called sincere apologies from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but repeated that now is an inopportune moment to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
Russian representative of the Athletics Federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin said at the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championship in Track Athletics, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to all the athletes, who had been stolen in the competition gold and silver medals.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to preserve the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the found evidence of the use of doping funded by the state.
"I thought that today's response, today's report was very sincere," said the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations of Cove to reporters.
"All the advice and the whole congress liked... That the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing its best to take care of the perestroika of the federation.
Cou said that he also liked that Russia agreed with the criteria for its restoration.
"I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of a special commission, according to which it is not time to restore Russia in rights," said Cove.
"In the next few months we have to do everything to settle this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the stained system, - he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will participate in the World Championships in Track and Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements are yet to be met to restore Russia.
As he reported to reporters in London after a report made at the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out in sufficient volume, and the distanced coaches are still calm to do their job.
Court Arrests Ukrainian Journalist Suspected of State Change
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky was put under arrest for two months, reports SBU.
An employee of the online publication "Journal Zhitomir" is suspected of state treason by posting their publications on Russian websites and infringement on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbarbarous policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The Patrol Ship "Commandante Borsini" entered the territorial waters of Libya, then together with the Navy of this country to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was made by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed it with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control most of the country's territory.
The Libyan parliament, opposed to the Cabinet and the Libyan parliament based in Tobruck, accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army Field Marshal Haftar gave his subordinates an order to counteract Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another military vessel to the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the negotiations of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the recognized Europe Libyan cabinet Faiz Saradzh.
Italian authorities went to establish a naval mission to combat illegal migration after the statistics on the number of illegal people who came to the country from Libya in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the resources for the reception of migrants have been exhausted.

Two leaders of the Ukrainian team in athletics suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povkh, specializing in the short-distance race, excluded from the national team of Ukraine at the World Cup 2017 in London.
This was reported on the website of the Athletics Federation of the country (FLAU).
This decision was made by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings against athletes.
The coach Sergey Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects athletes in the use of doping.
Povh - bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the World Championship 2011, European champion-2010 in the relay 4 to 100 meters, Zemlyanka - the winner of the European Championship in 2012 in the relay 4 to 400 meters.

How the financial rules of football will affect the move of Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not interfere with the posting world record transfer Neymar from the Spanish "Barcelona" to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may come further along the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body controlling European football, in whose authorities to prohibit teams to participate in the prestigious tournament "League of Champions."
From the rules of the financial "Fire-play" introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that "PSG" will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
"Barcelona" paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) only for freeing the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
"PSG" can definitely fork to hire Neymar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, taking into account the funding of the team from the rich energy of the ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of players, but they have to equate them through legal sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FSEI was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
Former French footballer believed that clubs that climb into huge debts in their pursuit of success, in fact, cheated and risked ruining in case the banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, "FSP" stopped focusing on the debts of the clubs and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model, which was originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential, and then seriously spend, in order to improve the team and create a world brand, became a difficult plan.
During this three-year period of 2018, clubs may suffer losses of EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini was dismissed with shame in 2015, his successor to UEFA Alexander Cheferin is still determined to restrain excessive expenses.
"Difference, "FFS" is alive, and we will be moving forward, will tighten the rules," said last week to the agency "Associate Press" Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFA in UEFA.
Although "PSG" will pay the redemption of Neymar's contract at a time, he may distribute this amount for the reporting at the entire term of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer price can be shown in annual reports as costs of 44.4 million euros in the next five years.
During the first wave of sanctions - FP - in 2014 to the PSA, as well as the most severe sanctions were applied to Abu Dhabi "Manchester City."
"PSG" was fined 60 million euros (at that rate is 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of his team in the Champions League during the season 2014-1015 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to outwit its financial inspections, blowing their income at the expense of companies related to the owners of the club.
Although the Qatari company could sponsor PSG, but if the amount of funding was considered exceeding the standard market prices, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legal income.
This is what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding "PSG" by the Tourism Office of Qatar was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings in the PSG could be paid by the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar-2022 deny that Neymar will become the ambassador of the World Cup, and such maneuver could easily be found inspectors of UEFA.
The past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, the faces familiar with the situation, UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with "PSG" about the transfer of Neymar.
They communicated with the agency Assoshied Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation of "PSG."
According to the latest reported report, in 2015-1016 PSG's profit received more than 10 million euros when the turnover of 522.4 million euros.
The reporting for the last fiscal year has not yet been published.
"PSG" expects that the arrival of Neymar will be a favorable ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and t-shirts with the team logo.
The club assumes that the turnover will grow by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players leaves, the Spanish league tried to prevent the transfer of Neymar, saying that PSGI will violate the financial Schfeier Play.
This is an obvious case of the "Financial doping," with the club and the state, - said the Spanish newspaper "AS" President La Liga Javier Tebas, bearing in mind that the ultimate owner of the PSG is Qatar.
The coach Arsenalak Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares the doubts of La League about the funding of the club by the state.
"This is all the consequences of shared participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football in the last fifteen years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with the financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The president will determine the order and places of taking an oath
Where and how new Russian citizens will pledge fealty to the Russian Federation, the president will determine such amendments to the second reading to the corresponding law developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the order of taking oath in the law.
Children under 18 years of age and incapable will be released from the solemn oath, as well as incapable, follows from the amended text of amendments to the bill "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation" (there is at the disposal of "Izvestia"), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of an oath when entering into Russian citizenship instead of formal signing of documents on June 6 during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The MPs issued this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading into a bill envisaging the abolition of the decision to extradite citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted for a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, for public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (part). 2 Art. 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for hijacking an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if this act is associated with terrorism (part). 4 st. 211 Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, the logic was as follows: by drawing up documents for citizenship, a person signs under the promise to comply with the Russian legislation - getting on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
In April, the bill was submitted to the Duma by Duma leaders Vladimir Vasiliev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (Just Russia) and Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies accepted it in the first reading.
Last week the State Construction and Legislation Committee approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the order of taking oath will be established by the president of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation," indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - a list of places where the Russian coat of arms may be placed, was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state authorities of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could be the Registry Office.
Those who wish to obtain the citizenship of the Russian Federation will make a solemn oath after the officials check their documents.
But a Russian passport will be received only after taking an oath, follows from the modified text.
A week ago, the project said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn from 18 years old, not from 14.
There is a rule by which incapable or limited capable, as well as those who cannot utter, read or personally sign the oath text will be released from taking an oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and "other persons,"
Also, the updated bill outlines a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukrainian citizens, which are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by granting for this a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the statement will need to be handed over to Russian officials.
The refusal of "foreign" citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is stipulated by an international treaty or if it is impossible "due to persons-free reasons."
A group of deputies, including First Deputy Speaker of the Duma Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrahov (all United Russia) proposed the corresponding amendment to the law.
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is not realistic, it is simply impossible.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for a decision on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the day before the head of the Duma committee on state construction and legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (Yer).
In addition, the text clarifies that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who in writing renounced "other" citizenship and handed over their previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons beyond its control" it has not ceased to be a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are prohibited to occupy positions in the municipal service, to be hired to the facilities and in the organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with double citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law must come into force on September 1, 2017, by the time the necessary acts of law should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes niche in the "Fighting American Summer" and "Comrade detective"
The current iteration of history nostalgically recalls simultaneously the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; about the era of the grandeur in the 90s (approximately at the time when the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made a comedy sketch "State for MTV"), and about himself - that is, about 2001, before her stars, as Elisabeth Banks, Emil Paul and more serious.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the elevation and embodiment of our epoch with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise it seems anachronism.
The "First Day of the Camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of absurd humor (including the original story of the speaking jar of vegetables, voiced by X. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached the age of majority; thanks to this, the impossibility to return to the joke becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have already played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and his parody is more systemless and includes riffs from stalker films of the 90s such as "Hands rocking cradle."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many storyline moves are the same.
Kindness Coup (Showolter), now the writer, has not yet achieved reciprocity from Katie (Margherit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still did not part with virginity.
And there is still a crazy and nasty conspiracy, which involved Ronald Reagan (also Shouolter), who is now instigating George W. Bush (a proven parody performed by Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is deviations from it.
It is especially amusing to see the eternally young Radda, who sings Matt Dillon's song from the "One," whose character, the former big man Andy now looks old man.
To bring this franchise success could be accidental in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up," until it comes to the point that, in my opinion, it would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American summer: twenty years later," where in the last stage the whole company would go to the film on the premiere of the movie "Hot American Summer."
The "Comrade Detective" in Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from the "Americans," "Explosive blonde" or even "Blesska" with its images of the struggle between the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak with director Reese Thomas depicts a telefilm: the Romanian police drama of the 80s about two policemen in Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - Gregor's life and idealist Josef - are performed by Florin Piersik Jr. and Cornelius Ulic, and voiced their dialogues in English Channing Tattoo (as well as executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are several visual jokes (police officers spend time watching a match on chess, as Americans could watch football).
A team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slayt, Nick Offferman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevinyi - allows you to play interestingly in "guess a voice."
But the "Comrade Detective" is so held for the credibility of the awkward propaganda drama - there is even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are tightened, and it is not very and often funny.
If it had been shorter, the "Comrade detective" could better cope with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Josef come to the American embassy, two thick men are sitting in the entrance hall, two thick men who are absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
This image to the imaginary spectator of the Communists says that Western culture is capable of making obligatory littering out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do so with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup in football between "Spartak" and "Lokomotiv" will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the president of the Russian Football Premier League (Russian Football League) Sergei Pradkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, according to RT.
He also added that by now there are almost no tickets for the match.
The match "Spartak" - "Lokomotiv" will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, "Spartak" - the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Lokomotiv" is the winner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufa residents cleaned the furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
Recently 37-year-old Ufamets, who has a furniture company, turned to the police.
The man announced the theft of expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to its production.
Profit thieves were instruments with a total cost of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, punch, hydraulics, winch.
The guards of the order began to search for criminals and soon went to the inhabitants of Blagoveshchensky district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic, the accomplices infiltrated the territory of the enterprise, broke the front door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment the first car service.
The case of theft has already been filed against them, and the law enforcers managed to return only a part of the stolen tools to the legal owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words on the relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev about the relations of the two countries.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that having adopted new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared a full trade war to Russia.
Commenting on these words, Nauert admitted that the Russian-American relations are at a "low level," but noted that it is necessary to look for "regulations for cooperation."
"Look at the truce in the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," the diplomat RIA Novosti quotes.
At the same time, the representative of the Foreign Ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that the sanctions are equivalent to the trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, US President Donald Trump signed last Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document was unsuccessful and contradicts the American Constitution.
Dior "grows" roses from amethyst and quartz

Trump finds culprits of deterioration of relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump made a sharp criticism against the members of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
"You can thank the Congress, these same people can not even give us medicine," the President wrote on Twitter.
On the eve of Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
They, in particular, will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House issued a statement by the president, in which he pointed out that the law would not allow the United States to conclude profitable transactions and will bring Russia closer to China and North Korea.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
Belarusian entrepreneur Viktor Prokonenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision by RBC's intention to "concentrate on other our planned investments and projects we are working on."
According to Mr. Prokomeni, such a step will be "the best investment of time," despite the investment attractiveness of buying a daughter of Sberbank.
Mr. Prokokenya became the main contender for the purchase of a unit of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guceriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko introduced sanctions against their subsidiaries in March.
One of such financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - became Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of blackout in the Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation called the cause of blackout in the Crimea.
The head of department Alexander Novak made clarifications about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to the accident in the territory of the Krasnodar region.
The truck hit the power line in an accident, resulting in the disconnection of the Cuban and related Crimean networks.
Power failures in large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Specialists eliminated the problems within a few hours.
Initially it was reported that the cause of blackout could be abnormal heat.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that the interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation forced rumors of possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that the economic growth will remain slow, and the interest rates remained unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
Experts of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 against 2 for the preservation of rates at 0.25%, with fewer members of the committee this month supported the increase in rates, because the weak economic growth weakened the support of the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to increase by 1.7% interest in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income will continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in autumn.
However, the bank warned that the rate hikes in the next few years will be necessary to control the inflation caused by the Brexit, and said that the costs of loans will probably have to rise stronger than expected in the financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of a huge set of measures for the development of the economy, launched a year ago due to the Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close the urgent funding plan for which it lends to banks, although it announced that it is now to provide another 15 billion pounds within this plan.
In the protocol on the decision on the rates, the bank said: "According to MPC's main forecasts, the growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the near future remains slow, while the pressure on the real income of families continues to affect consumption.
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to suspend inflation, it will be necessary to tighten the financial policy, in a few more amounts than the markets expect.
At the moment, the markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and one more in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all the increases will be gradual and limited.
The bank's forecasts for an increase in this year and the next year are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank kept its forecast unchanged by 1.8% in 2018.
After these news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent disappointing growth indicators weakened the rise; GDP then rose by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, the growth seems to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's last inflation report gave little reason for the joy of the household, which hit high inflation and insignificant wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before decreasing.
The bank added that the financial policy may prevent the profits in the next few years, but expects that the wages will recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also focused on growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods, which is due to the low exchange rate of the pound, which will offset some of the lowered consumer spending.
The decision was made a year after last August rates were reduced to 0.25% after the shocking results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which caused the fall of the pound.
According to the bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully affect prices and economy.
Before the bank made its last decision at rates, the noise around the proposed rate hike increased, as inflation was increasingly pressured by the households that were experiencing strong pressure: three specialists included in the committee asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this fall was expected and in the coming months again compensated.
According to the bank, a higher indicator compared to the planned 2% is a result of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of the company Mortgage brokers, said: "If we take into account the recent fall of swaps, apparently, the mortgage market will again become even more competitive, as creditors require business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market looks particularly favorable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as the refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of lack of commission, as well as with a low rate, becomes popular, more than ever.
State Health Service will write a disputed drug for HIV 10,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to the "revolutionary drug for the prevention of HIV after the battle in the High Court on the financing of the drug from the State Health Service."
The National Health Service of England has announced that the pre-exposition HIV prevention (PrEP), a tablet taken before sex, which, as proven, reduces the risk of infection in people at risk, an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year probation period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the test after the Court of Appeals supported last year the decision of the High Court, which stated that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay PREP despite its statements that it should be financed by local authorities.
This step, announced on Thursday, was named the most important innovation by Simon Stevens, President of the National Health Service of England, and the National Administration for the Control of AIDS (NAT) called it a turning point.
Before the full launch of the program throughout England by April 2018, veneral clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to start registering people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-expositional prevention (PrEP) is a course of HIV-positive drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
According to studies, PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, there are enough certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to receive the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are unknown whether their HIV status is restrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and attached to general practitioners in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal clinic participating in the program.
The program will cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England this week after the international tender for purchases signed an agreement on providing the drug.
The study was built in such a way as to assess all the possibilities of PPE by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and use on a large scale.
This is the most important innovation to complement and strengthen the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another landmark in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the biggest health threats humanity faces.
Deborah Gold, President of the NAT (National Directorate for the Control of AIDS), said: This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is competently targeted to people in need of care and at risk, makes it possible to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at the HIV risk group, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new discoverer of new opportunities, the use of which a person can control himself without discussing this with his partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now, first of all, it is necessary to take care of the test to quickly unfold across the country, and that none of the HIV risk groups will be forgotten.
Now that we are provided with a PUP experimental drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at the HIV risk zone.
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgeson said: "We are very welcome to the beginning of the trial of PrEP, it is very late for months of delays and delays by the government.
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stopping the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us closer one to a full understanding of the benefits of PPE.
Now it is important that the test be developed as soon as possible across the country to protect people at the risk group on HIV and to advance us to stop the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution to support the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth Congress of the World Congress of the Tatars (VCT) adopted a resolution in which he noted the importance of maintaining the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a positively recommended form of organization of supreme state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "has played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
Recall that the agreement between Moscow and Kazan has been in force since July 24, 2007 was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and to maintain the name of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation, which has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only position called the "president."
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining international driving license
Traffic police departments experience a shortage of international driving licenses (IHU).
To get such rights, you have to wait for a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on vacation abroad on their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licenses remains contradictory.
The IHU was introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international law are recorded in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic in 1968, but in the countries that ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as well.
However, in fact, it all depends on specific police or rental offices: some require IHU, and someone is sufficient national rights.
In order to be safe, international law drivers still receive, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize neither national rights nor MIA.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all traffic police units, reports "Kommersant," conducting a study in a number of regions.
For example, in Moscow in the UGIBDD units are simply not issued, forms are not enough for four months.
You can make an appointment on the website of public services, but there the turn has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get "for technical reasons," without going into details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already encountered the problem, in social networks, such messages are increasingly appearing:
Irina Burmistrova: " Guess why it is impossible to get international rights in Moscow?"
It is correct, because in all departments of traffic police ended blanks.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question to knowledgeable people!"
It is necessary to obtain international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, all the time crammed far forward, on the site of the coupons do not give out (the button is, but the ticket can not give).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in the Spat time free to the fig.
Did anyone try to receive in another city?
Will work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the forms of international driving licenses have changed, so the units of the State Automobile Inspectorate are delivered new forms.
This may be the reason for the deficit, however, it is unclear what changes are being discussed, and this has not been reported before.
The forms are purchased by the Special Purpose Center in the field of road safety (TSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivers them to the traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with JSC "Goznak": in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand were produced. In 2016, 15 thousand were purchased from MVU forms. In 2017, the forms, 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with LLC "First Print Court" for the production of 70 thousand. forms.
There is a theory that the CAE just did not have time to conduct a tender, which is why there is a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to go on their own not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, it is unclear, so people are reinsured, so there is an agiotage of demand for international "cup."
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
Such a proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The international driving license (IHU) of the new model is valid from May 31, 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Minister of Justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko said that he does not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the Observer portal.
No international company, even a self-respecting, will not put a chatter or nut, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia regarding the Crimea.
"That is, according to my deep conviction, there are no prospects for this project," Petrenko said.
He added that he believes that Russia is unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build less large-scale objects.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to collapse.
"That is why I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that turned out to be so short-sighted to join this project," the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of a vault of the automobile arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch coast completed the enlargement assembly of the road arch of the Crimean bridge: its vault is closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"Once the bridge builders have prepared for installation on the channel poles of the railway arch," the information center of the project reported.
In April, Minister of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and Krasnodar region.
In Spain, dismissed an official who has not been to work for 10 years
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to civil service) was to possess the chief of the Spanish official Carles Recio?
A permanent walk stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still fired.
But not by his immediate boss.
What only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
The inhabitants seem to have long been used to all the chals of the "servant of the people."
And yet, officials all the time manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, the "sensation" was granted from Spain.
There, an employee of Valencia's archive, Carles Recio, managed to not go to work for ten years.
At the same time, he regularly received a salary.
And the whole solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
And now the "miraculous times" of Mr. Recio are over.
He was dismissed by the decision of the legislative assembly of Valencia.
The investigation revealed that the malicious promulgator every morning came to the office at 07:00 to be noted in the electronic system.
And then he went home.
Once again he appeared in the workplace at 16:00, to again note in the system that he left.
And so 10 years.
It also became known that all his free time stunted drawing comics at home.
Now deputies of the legislative assembly of Valencia think how to punish the immediate chief of Mr. Resio, who could not help but know how to "actively work" in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges are offered to protect against chairmen
On behalf of Vladimir Putin, the Presidential Human Rights Council has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of power.
The LCC proposes to limit the powers of the chairmen of courts and to introduce their election.
For the courts of appeal and cassation instances of the SPH wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals within the presidential order.
The SPH has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian justice.
This work was carried out on the instructions of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the members of the council.
At the meeting with the Council members on December 8, 2016, including certain cases of arbitrariness, as well as the problems of public control in places of detention of citizens were discussed (see. "Sh" from December 9).
The result of the work of the SPH was 25 proposals, which relate both to the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and detection of judicial errors, as well as financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the chairmen of courts to increase the independence of other judges.
If the candidate for the position of a judge has successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judiciary, the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the CCS, must submit him to his appointment, without the right to refuse, as the law allows now.
It is also proposed to deprive the chairman of the right to distribute cases for consideration between judges.
To do this, experts admit, can a specially written computer program.
The LCC also believes that the chairman has no right to "determine the results of the judge's qualification certification, to initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to move to "the election of the chairmen of courts by the judges themselves" and "to give them powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation."
Now all the chairmen of courts (from republican to district) are appointed by the president for six years on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the LCC proposes to re-organize appeals and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The SPH says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take the practice of arbitration courts as the basis.
They have "judicial districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guaranteeing a great independence from regional officials, who are difficult to use "telephone law."
World judges of the Serbian Orthodox Church proposes to strengthen people's attendants in order to consider with their participation some "category of civil and administrative cases."
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration at work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of driving license, etc. n.
"These are only our proposals," said Tamara Morshchakov, a member of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the judge of the Constitutional Court.
She also recalled that the President's order was not only related to the SPH, but also to the Supreme Court (the Supreme Court), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the Armed Forces to fulfill the order (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Human Rights Commissioner in the Russian Federation).
Vyacheslav Lebedev, chairman of the Armed Forces, is due to the fact that the independence of justice is in Russia to be ensured by September 1.
Living a high life: half-floor and cunning designer receptions turned this small apartment into Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joanne Lee, a former banker interested in real estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a nice typical house in the style of Queen Anna, and in favor of the new design says that Joanne did not collect her belongings and did not move again.
"Earlier I lived with my former Knightsbridge in a much larger square," Joanne says.
"I've been looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her, and offered the price on the same day.
Since the first viewing, the apartment of 1000 square feet has undergone a complete reconstruction.
Initially it was an apartment with one bedroom complex layout - to get into the bedroom, had to go through the kitchen and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and half-floor to squeeze the most benefits from the generous height of the ceilings.
I wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the architectural and design studio in Notting Hill Duck &amp; Shed, so that they use the ceilings of 12.5 feet high and create a dwelling that would not only be a successful project, but would be Joanne for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one over the other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-floor where it would be possible to stand in full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the hair.
"Working with steel structures is very complex," he explains.
We had to place the rooms so that they could be one over the other, and they didn't have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but to be curved structures, so that they were at the right height and allow to use the rooms from above and below.
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one over the other in the designated space and much more interesting.
From the floor through the vintage copper light window from the Retrouviusé opens a view of the chic living room at the bottom.
Mirrored furniture with golden finishes, silver accents and vintage lighting devices from Serge Muja set the design style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding entertainment, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it longer.
In the kitchen, a mirror protective panel seems to be a window to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a feeling of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a moving up door, as in a garage.
"Here was involved engineering art" - tells Erfan about reinforced steel wood-fibre shield door.
"It is equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it is very easy to slide."
With the intelligent use of space and storage space, Joanne has received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"After all, the area of the sexes is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"Grub, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations on the basis of the area of the floor.
Here they were able to increase the area of the floors, using quality materials that give space a shade of luxury.
"Materials are what we touch, so they help to create an emotional connection with the house," says Erfan.
"Nobody falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It is important, but does not hurt the strings of our hearts.
This is evidence of the fact that due to a good design and increased footage, the apartment can from something ordinary to turn into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.

Inflation in the G20 countries shrank to an eight-year low
The rise in consumer prices in the G20 countries has declined to the minimum in the past eight years, according to The Wall Street Journal citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation in June 2016 was 2% - lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat announced a 0.1% decline in the consumer price index in Russia.
Thus, the department recorded the first in 2017 a week deflation.
According to the Ministry of Finance, the inflation target in Russia is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this agency, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal cutting down of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during a meeting on environmental development of the Baikal territory warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that the bill had been prepared earlier.
He allows cutting down of the forest during the elimination of fires, and the government plans to accept it already in the autumn.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that "everything is not cut down in a row."
Donskaya noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Mass media: soldiers of the Supreme Court secretly agree with the militia of Donbass
On the line of armed confrontation in Donbass established regular telephone communication.
The fighters of the opposing parties constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and about this communication is not known in the headquarters.
The soldiers of the Supreme Court and the militia of Donbass established communication on cell phones secretly from their high command.
This is reported on August 4, "Country.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, commanders of units are well aware of the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and daily communicate with them by phone.
Communication is not domestic at all: commanders are trying to reach certain "tactical agreements."
Often, according to the results of such conversations, there is a truce in a certain area of the front.
Journalists were informed about the cases when a prisoner received congratulations on his birthday from the front line from his formal enemy.
The soldiers of the Supreme Court and the militia of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics are sitting in trenches on the line of demarcation since spring 2014, when Ukraine started a combat operation against Donbass.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs outraged the blocking of statements by the UN Security Council on attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives who block the statements of the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
It is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The Ministry reminded that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2, the third time in a month was mortared by terrorists of the groups "Heyat Tahrir Ash-Sham" (former "Dzhabhat al-Nusra," banned in Russia) and "Falak Ar-Rakhman."
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of "Nusra" as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for counteracting this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that the attacks of the "Nusra" should meet the general unconditional and decisive condemnation, and in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions should not be any ambiguity."
However, as the diplomatic mission stressed, "for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council alternately, varying the tonality of objections, hiding the arguments about the alleged absence of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement of the Security Council for the press with the condemnation of terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital."
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us may remain in the conscience of these delegations.
"The most outrageous is the fact that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, makes them feel impunity," the Foreign Ministry said and added that "it would not like these barbarians to have a conviction that someone in the Security Council with them at the same time would be created."
Vladimir Putin advocates limiting the number of unscheduled business inspections
Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East said that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and also said the need to limit the period of inspections by ten days.
"Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% agree with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," - quotes President TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that it is necessary to prohibit investigators from withdrawing servers and hard disks in enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"I hope that this will make a certain positive in the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity, or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the Head of State said.
As reported by Kommersant, due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, by order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it turned out that in fact there was a replacement of planned inspections by unscheduled (the share of those who faced them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutor's (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raid (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as well as statements by the authorities (10.5%) and 15.5% of the investigations.

Brothers are fighting for the real estate empire worth more than $ 500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest empires in Victoria in the state of real estate worth more than 500 million dollars - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former director of the football club Carlton and developer Colin de Lutis lives in Turak Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him to the Supreme Court for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still going on a fierce dispute about the conditions of divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded the company "Westco Jeans," which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of ownership of the De Lutis family includes today office buildings, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Golden Bank and in Mount Bull and shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with the deceased father Colin - whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul - about one third.
According to the court, this means that the property of Colin is 316 million, and Paul - 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts to reconcile, the first hearings were held at the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business - from which, in Paul's opinion, Colin excluded him.
Kolin claims that this is not the case, but he accuses Paul of incompetent management of some objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes for resolving the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family the highest priority," he wrote.
Judicial costs are growing as a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Kuck Cramer are involved; both parties have attracted the most famous lawyers, including the royal lawyer Allan Mayers, and the best streamers.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late wife Luigi were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s they managed dairy bars and gastronomy, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood, in which Colin opened the first family store jeans.
Kolin says he launched Westco when he was "in the last grades of the school, and Paul was then a boy (approximately 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that he and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Louji often told me that he didn't want the brothers to understand the court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the group of companies of De Lutis; Colin says that Mark got 10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their division."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to the biography of Eddie McGir published in 2015, the best friend of the TV star.
On Friday Farfax Media contacted Kolin and Paul and their lawyers.
Only Kolin responded, with a text message saying that since the case was not yet considered in court, "I have nothing to say."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and tremble in court the name of our family," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I'm arguing in court," he said, adding that "he still hopes for the resolution of the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seemed to have been dispersed.
"The decision on our case will be issued soon by the court," Kolin wrote.
The new head of Trump's apparatus plans to limit the receipt of information to the president.
Others tried to do this and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really succeed.
In that case, he will be the first.
"Politico" reports that the new head of the White House's apparatus plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news from the media, hoping to keep the boss in a calmer state.
That's what the reporter Josh Douzi reports.
"At the meeting held by the new head of the White House apparatus John F. Kelly with the leadership of the apparatus on his first working day, he outlined the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump, which he hopes to solve: bad channels of information receipt to the president."
Kelly told the staff that the information should pass through him - paper or through briefings - because the president will make decisions if he receives the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis is quite true, but others have already failed, trying to calm Trump down, tracking the receipt of information.
President Trump's relations with television developed a few decades ago - and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, being a candidate, was indignant about the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he received fair coverage in publications that could be reconvinced," said Sam Nanberg, former advisor to the electoral staff in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote then in Politico that "according to the words of six former members of the electoral staff, in order to keep Trump's habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to make sure that the information coming to him personally was a constant stream of praise."
Well.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing on Twitter has ever been "under control," is simply ridiculous.
Perhaps these members of the electoral staff know something we don't know - for example, if they were not, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump has not published.
If his co-workers protected him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to promote their agenda by giving Trump a reliable or not - which confirms their views.
"Politico" - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly pick up the president questionable information.
Here is one example described by reporter Shein Goldmacher:
"The current and former Trump's employees say that Trump can react very sharply to negative reports in the press, especially containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not calm down until he finds who was behind them.
This happened in late February, when someone put the president a printout of an article with GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Welsh was accused of "standing behind a number of leaks" in the White House.
It does not matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he did not present specific facts or that in the past he launched false accusations and then refused them.
Trump read the article and began to ask the staff about Welsh."
Goldmother adds that the then head of the apparatus Reins Pribus and Secretary of the Office Rob Porter "tryed to build a system to control the flow of papers that Trump receives, and document them."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same.
Maybe he will be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his assistants are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's Office Fights HIV Dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the decision of the Kalininsky District Court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident, who died of a young daughter from HIV.
According to the investigation, the child was killed because the mother was an HIV dissident and refused to treat.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated on the part. 1 st. 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death on negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection 4V stage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is a HIV-infected person.
"The woman was not treated by herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there is no HIV infection," the Prosecutor's Office of Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case was filed in Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The father of the deceased girl filed a petition for this, explaining that "I have forgiven my wife, has no claims to her, she has ironed the harm and apologized."
The Prosecutor's Office did not agree with the court decision and filed an appeal demanding the annulment of the decision on the termination of the case and to send it for a new consideration.
The girl died, and it is impossible to smooth the harm caused by the crime.
The mother, infected with the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection," the press service of the Prosecutor's Office reported.
According to the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
According to the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care due to parents" refusal.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of work of a special group, half of parents who categorically refused to treat children from HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to carry out diagnostics, began to take drugs," said Elena Loseva, press secretary of the AIDS Center.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents by a legislative way, and as a result not all HIV-infected children can be found - mothers do not allow them to investigate, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What is the danger of HIV dissidents
Late last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medicines.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their dissemination they see a serious threat.
A terrible photo session, which ended in tragedy, occurred on Thursday, August 3, at the railway station Grechany in Khmelnitsky.
A cheerful company of drunk young people strolled the bridge over the railway tracks, where the cargo train was just standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, "FACTS" reported in the police communication sector in Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his indiscretion he caught on the power line and instantly received a shock current.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately called "emergency."
Before the arrival of doctors moved the victim to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department Khmelnytsky regional clinical hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns of torso 1x2 degrees.
Now his condition doctors assess as stable.
Law enforcers remind that recently more and more popular are becoming extremely selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, moving transport.
Police urges people to be vigilant and prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Venus
In ancient Venus could exist oceans.
This assumption was made by French scientists.
Specialists have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that in Venus at the beginning of its history formed oceans, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, the Arguments of the Week wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean could exist 4 billion years ago on Mars.
Foreign specialists in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

Gypsy overcame the ditch and returned to the miner's village "
Some of the most wealthy homeowners of West Midland again conflict with the resolute Roma who overcame the trench dug by the municipal authorities to reoccupy the field next to their homes.
Gypsy parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Sorichal, which received the joking name of the millionaires.
Bringing with them horses, babies, and many houses on the wheels, they returned after they were driven out no later than in May, and they were not disturbed by the pit dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a break in the defensive structures and squeezed its vehicles through the area that was left unentained to leave the place for the path.
The indignant people attacked the municipality of Sorichal, saying that he was incapable of solving this problem.
Anonymous local resident reported: "They came here on Monday evening, after they were driven out of Bentley Hit, where they threw stones in passers-by.
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The girds were here in May, they were chased away, and here they returned again.
Last night, even more Gypsy came, and today, perhaps, even more.
"The Birmingham's Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term court decisions to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbruck road, and I do not like that I continue to pay municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put the end.
One local resident who wanted to remain anonymous, said: "It's ridiculous, we've just seen these Roma leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues.
This time they became more, and we even saw a horse grazing on the meadow.
The representative of the municipality of Solihalla said: "We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbruck road and cooperate with the police of Solichal; we take the necessary legal actions so that as soon as possible they are driven away.
To help us collect certificates, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report on any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by phone 101.
This allows us to make an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the plant of champagne wines "New World"
SUE of the Republic of Crimea "The plant of champagne wines "New World" decided to campaign, converting into the OJSC "The plant of champagne wines "New World," follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukhina.

The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will amount to 595.5 million rubles. and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles. each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if in the next three years there will be no funds for the modernization of the enterprise, there will be a threat of stopping the plant.
Depreciation of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of profit into the budget income.
What remains is not enough for the implementation of the modernization plan.
"It is difficult to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about borrowing funds of large credit organizations," said Sergei Petelin, deputy head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea in April this year.
The Parliament of Crimea included the company in the forecast plan of privatization for 2017.
It was proposed to conduct its promotion and put on sale.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of Crimea estimated the possible cost of selling the company in $ 40 million, investment of the investor in modernization - another $ 30 million.
"New World" in 2016. increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015. - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017. The "New World" intended to release 1.6 million bottles.

The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third graders defeated more than 40 gravestones
Employees of the Interior Ministry's Office in the Nizhny Novgorod region identified citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of Lyskovo.
The students of the third grade were attackers.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown people was received by the Russian police department in Lyskovsky district on June 27.
In total, 24 people appealed to the police about this.
As a result, a criminal case under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, Damage or Desecration of burial places" was opened.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they turned out to be two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 years.
Juvenile offenders told the police that it was interesting for them to see how the monuments fall, and this prompted them to hooliganic actions.
Preventive measures were carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone towards the ships of NGOs that save migrants.
Italy warned NGOs that belong to rescue ships in the Mediterranean Sea that they will not be able to continue to work if they do not comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not obey the new code of conduct, it is hard to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," said Interior Minister Mario Minniti in an interview with the daily Stampa daily newspaper.
The warning of Mintni was made the day after the Italian authorities confiscated the ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization "Jugend Rettet," on suspicion that his crew actually cooperates with human traffickers and facilitates illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which worked for a year, refused to comment on the merits of detailed accusations brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Kartorosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we can not continue our activities in the search and rescue zone," reads the statement of the organization in social networks.
"We will be able to evaluate all the accusations brought now only after we have collected all the information and be able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Juventa ship owned by Jugend Rette since October.
His crew suspected that the whole rescue boats were taking on board the migrants who were sent directly to them by human traffickers, and allowed smugglers to leave with the boats they could reuse.
At least one such meeting is supposed to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, - this is stated in the prosecution, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, who control rescue operations in this area, rather from humanitarian zeal than for any other motives.
The Code of Conduct presupposes mainly that Juventa ships will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations agreed to obey the code: "Save Children," Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activa Raspers embrace" from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, provided that they do not entail any "significant changes or interference" of its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is also the Nobel Prize organization "Doctors without Borders" (MSF).
Meanwhile, Mintani said that a sharp decline in the last weeks of the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on initiatives on economic development with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of getting to Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict"
The Russian authorities have recently intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, the delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have become part of the delegations.
The head of the Russian contact group for the intra-Lithuanian settlement under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma, assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Dengov told Kommersant what goals Moscow pursues in this region and on whom he bets.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group in Libya that you are heading.
Here, say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here - the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what goals are you pursuing?
The contact group was established on the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (deputy of the Duma from Chechnya. - "Sh").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The detainment of the Russian tanker Mechanic Cebotarev in Libya (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "Sh").
We were thinking about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the Duma was created, and head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov supported our work.
And how did it happen that you headed it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the work of the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors with the Mechanic Chebotarev.
We managed to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the recognized UN government headed by Faiz Saradzh is based. - "Sh"), and with Tobruck (the residence of the parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khaftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya. - "Sh").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Methig (Livia's Vice Prime Minister - Kommersant), we managed to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the sides of the conflict, we are conducting a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are constantly in Libya?
Now the contact group includes five people.
Among them there are people who have experience in security agencies, including the Defense Ministry.
We also want to introduce specialists in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
No one is constantly in Libya from our employees, so far there is no need.
Is there Russian military advisors and instructors in Libya now.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are untrue.
But former military are included in your contact group...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or such closed to a certain point for us cities as Misrata (where the militia groups are based, played a role in overthrowing the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in the following years. - "Sh").
We arrived in Misurata in January this year.
We were frightened, they said that there are all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to evaluate the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are rumors like the role of Islamists.
In Misurata we met with all the representatives of the detachments who were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirta (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was defeated by militants of the banned "Islamic state" in Russia - "Sh").
We wanted to see them, to get acquainted with these people, to check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, rather than Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And to what conclusion have you come to?
The "Islamic State" in Libya has not won Haftar?
This was not what he was doing.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And ISIS in Sirta fought structures that obeyed the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was received by the Federation Council, the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and the Russian Guard.
As we have understood, you are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that it will be possible to implement ceasefire agreements on holding elections that were reached in late July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as it has happened many times in the past, the agreements will be disrupted, the hostilities will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to the next meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders spoke very negatively about each other.
As for Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftara, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when there were in Misurata, and Haftar was on this day on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But they did not believe in Misrata in coincidence.
We were told, "You are probably very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not support Haftara alone, we are in dialogue with all key participants in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar communicated.
Does understanding with Russian partners at a human, emotional level make the fact that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know the Russian language?
He knows Russian if he knows, it is very relative.
But the fact that he studied with us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak Russian perfectly.
And to reach for Russia, to some extent they experience nostalgia on it.
Do you think it is a probable early abolition of the weapons embargo imposed against Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
Of course, they are interested, but, as I said, we do not occupy someone else in this conflict and would not like to arm some at the expense of others.
We would like everyone to be in about equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, the Libyans constantly call for Russia to somehow contribute to its removal.
The process of constitution development is now actively advancing in Libya.
We hope that the parties will make compromise solutions, and reach an internal consensus.
Then the elections should be held, as discussed at the meeting of Saraj and Haftara.
If the elections take place and will finally be elected legitimate power (and now none of the parties has such a status), then it is possible to put in the UN Security Council the issue of lifting the weapon embargo.
To raise this question is now meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees floating from Libya, feels abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation using their ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the option that Haftara detachments will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers who transport immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
Italians need support from Russia because Moscow is conducting a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj, Misrata and the south of the country.
And in this issue, the tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it possible for Southers to stop the flows of migrants on distant approaches?
That is, conventionally speaking, the buses in which Nigerian migrants go back?
We are doing this.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in these streams to continue to go.
We hope to contribute to uniting the Southmen in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But to begin with, we would like to see the unity of the opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How radical does he adhere to?
Will this become an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will express my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, the opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where does he have such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli - it is the capital, there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not climbing there.
And we mixed them all the cards and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruck.
And we are already reaping the benefits of this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
The director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin concluded the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I believe that resell.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
The plans are to resign the contracts concluded under Muammar Gaddafi.
In particular, we are talking about the previous agreements in the transport sphere (building railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
And the Libyans have something to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, we are talking about the scheme of "oil in exchange for services"?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are actually engaged in peacekeeping work there.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree with each other, so that they can establish order and Libya cease to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task - to help the Libyan people and squeeze out terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR in Libya (now or earlier)?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that today there is no one from Russia and other countries of the former USSR.
He said that he had about 50 thousand. Records of telephone conversations of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "B") and Russian speech does not sound there.
And from which states then these militants?
I would not like to go into these details.
Then we will formulate the question differently.
How many Islamic militants in Libya themselves are many of the Islamic militants themselves?
There are practically no Libyans among them, they are not more than 5%.
The rest are the migrants.
Can Moscow hold intra- Libyan negotiations on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are conducting active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and announced their readiness to come back to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
Now it is hard to say.
Several visits should still take place, and then I hope that there will be clarity about the time and place of negotiations.

30-year-old resident of Olevsk Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium shot several times in the direction of teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angry with the noise, reported "facts" in the communication department of the police Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to the cafe, located nearby.
In the building he had a conflict, during which a man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the Rifleman had escaped by this time.
The law enforcers identified his identity and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He seized a device for shooting rubber bullets, which was sent for examination.
On this fact started criminal proceedings under the article. 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.

Michel Carter's verdict for reports that led to the suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts resident was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for leading to suicide by her boyfriend Conrad Roy with the help of text messages and phone calls.
Michel Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of his term in the grid and another 5 years of probation period.
Carter was found guilty of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy in June, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearings on Thursday: "My family is killed by grief.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free before the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum term of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy suffered mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, clinging her hands and bowing her eyes.
"With her actions she killed Konrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She did not recognize the responsibility," she said.
"She did not show repentance."
But the lawyer Carter said it was a "tragic case she is deeply sorry for."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his opinion, her "age, the level of maturity, or even mental illness did not affect her actions noticeably."
The defendant read the statements of Roy Lynn Roy's mother, saying: "No day has passed when I would not mourn for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I cope - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Roja Kamdin Roy said that she was invigorating to the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become aunt of his children.
"To be a person who has always been with me since my birth is a pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case seems to be a legal precedent, as Massachusetts does not have a law that would provide for the responsibility for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case attracted the attention of the whole country, when it became known that it was pushed to suicide Carter's message.
"You can hang up, jump from the roof, I don't know how to kill yourself with a knife," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before the suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You only have to turn on the ignition, and you will be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention with the help of Roy's death, and forbade her to communicate with the press to prevent her from getting the desired.
The opinions of the lawyers on this issue are divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for the murder in Italy of his British neighbor in the apartment and justified two years later.
30-year-old Knox published in Los Angeles Times her special opinion, which stated: "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."

"Audi" will be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by "Audi" said that they will offer to upgrade the software of more than 350,000 cars.
The chairman of "BMW" said that the company believes that the news is more intelligent than the restrictions on driving, bearing in mind the European cities - including Munich, where the ?BMW - which considered the possibility to ban or limit the use of diesel cars.
"Daimilli said on Thursday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies called their step a review.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to contribute to the compliance with the rules for the emission of carbon dioxide.
But nitrogen oxides, which throw out diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers of the equipment neutralizing exhaust gases of diesel vehicles is also increasing, and maintaining the competitive price of cars becomes difficult.
While German automakers are under close attention, the Chancellor's government, Angela Merkel, was also accused of indulging influential automakers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the mistakes of "VolksWagen", which hid the use of the so-called damage devices, which during the testing could improve the number of emissions of harmful gases, so that it corresponds to the rules, and in the conditions of normal driving disconnected.
In the United States, several leaders of the "VolksWagen" were convicted, while the others were under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, the former head of the thermodynamics department was arrested as part of the engine development group "Audi."
Former manager, Zackeo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and can appear before the court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was under German criminal investigation involving "VolksWagen" after the authorities accused the authorities of installing a system to bypassing European emission rules and expanded the investigation, which was previously concentrated on the United States.
Inclusion of "Audi" in the investigation can create serious problems - Volkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of disproportionately large share of income "VolksWagen."
In Astrakhan, the visitor of the cafe paid with fake money
The police received a report from the employee of the bank's branch about the discovery when recounting the funds received from the point of catering, suspicious banknotes with a par value of 5,000 rubles.
The research conducted at the Forensic Center showed that it is false.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought shaurma, paid the banknote.
It is worth noting that the cashier was not equipped with the device for the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, police installed persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a deliberately fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for a term of up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of Astrakhan region to be careful when performing financial operations; it is recommended for employees of objects of trade to install devices for authentication of received funds.
Astronomers have found a "Head" planet on which even iron can melt
For the first time having studied the properties of the stratospheric giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysics were much surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Specialists noticed that water molecules are so heated by star light that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the radiance of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature makes the water in the planet's atmosphere glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the Solar System, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
Because of this year, the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earthly" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but now fears that climate change threatens it.
Lavender became worse to grow because of drought weather and tolerant diseases of insects; this was the cause of constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute located in Provence, says: "Lavanda in Provence is really threatened because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change: in spring and especially in the autumn of the rains, it has become much smaller.
This affects the life of lavender.
And there are also small cicadas jumping on the leaves of insects that carry micro-bacteria; in very dry weather they become very much."
A lot is placed on the map.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very popular in perfumes and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of very long spikes with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or generally absent.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oil."
Solutions that are now being considered include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey, ambassador of the Winter Universiade 2019 Alexander Semin met on the eve of the start-up hockey players and distributed autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 within the framework of the thematic week dedicated to hockey with washer.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on the playground with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games with the drawing of souvenirs of student games, warm-up from the aerobics federation were organized.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semin advised the children to engage in as much as possible at sports grounds and stressed that the most important at the initial stage of training - hard work and a huge desire to engage in hockey.
"It is great that Krasnoyarsk has such a platform as the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams," the champion said.
It should be noted that ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk citizens.
The campus will work throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Winter Universiade-2019 reports.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words
TBиTHyTb TBиTHyTb Spokesman of the US Department of State Heather Nauert, commenting at a briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, announced the need to find "regulations for cooperation" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to "improve bilateral cooperation."
Nauert called the agreement on the ceasefire as an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev's approval of a full trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said this, it, of course, has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more about this," the representative of the State Department said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill on tightening sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington declared a full trade war to Moscow, ending the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that the U.S. sanctions will act for decades.
In addition, according to the Prime Minister, the US establishment "clean beat" Trump.
The bodybuilder who was missing in Moscow region was found at someone else's dacha lost his memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very piquant circumstances: he left the car cabin to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and local residents.
And Shamil found himself in a foreign dacha in Ramenskoye.
His master found him completely naked in his toilet.
Dagestan athlete could not explain how it turned out to be here and what happened to him.
He could not even remember what his name was, and his passport disappeared.
The identification was helped by the announcement of his loss.
The doctors who arrived at the call fixed a partial loss of memory and brain injury, the public Mash reports.
Probably, the athlete is waiting for other surprises.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil probably had already visited his apartment, whose keys were also stolen from him.
July oil and gas revenues exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received following the results of July 2017 The estimate exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, as explained by the agency, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June, used for the assessment, as well as due to exceeding the actual volume of gas production and exports of oil products of the forecasted levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly assessment corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019 is forecasted in August 2017 in the amount of +40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said.
Thus, the aggregate amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchase of foreign currency will be in the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the transactions of the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions of purchase of foreign currency at the organized trading of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The purchased foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist stresses that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the weekly newspaper "Ridos" usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the continuing war of drug dealers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists were discussing what seems safer: to take children with them to the office in 2009, which was already thrown to the grenade in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name each column - there is no need for evidence, there will be enough suspicions and internal sensations.
They are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the content of the government or cartels, a whole list of scoundrels, because of which the work on covering chaos in Mexico becomes dangerous.
Violence does not give a respite, and among the corpses that multiply in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year at least seven people were killed in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspirer, co-founder of Riodos Javier Waldes Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdes wrote in one of his numerous books about drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, although his presence everywhere - a big photograph of Valdes, showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hangs on the facade of the building "Riodos"; two reporters for 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which depicted his smile, face in glasses or his branded panama.
The seminar is held less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general injury, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although in 2010 the office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was organized to investigate journalism cases, so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases were investigated.
As in the case of the majority of the thousands of murders committed every year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, the murderers of journalists rarely appear before the court.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although it is now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, - says Ibarra.
"It's very foolish to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"As long as we don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
In the morning of May 15, Valdes left the office of Riodos in the capital of the state of Kuliacane.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Coroll stopped two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot at it 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelve River."
The gunner drove away in his car and smashed her nearby.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually quickly diverge on the Culiacan.
But about Valdes almost everyone is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and issued in the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.
Let us not say that every day on the streets of Sinaloa kill one or several people, or that the cemetery is filled with decomposed two-storey mausoleums of drug kings, which are more than the houses of many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of "quietness" is just when one of the cartels takes control of the seaside staff with important ports and paths of drug trafficking leading in the United States.
Despite this, and the fact that Valdes knew perfectly well about the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old co-founder and director of "Riodos," was crushed by a sense of guilt for failing to protect a friend.
He thinks that the murder has helped two mistakes.
First, in February an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel factions, which fights with the sons of Guzman, was published.
The publication could anger the sons; the people who were supposedly members of the gang bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not make Valdes leave the country for his own security after another newspaper, which wrote about the same story, was captured.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was regarded as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest and in 2003, he founded Riodocer with five colleagues, selling his 50-dollar actions.
In Sinaloa "it was impossible to engage in journalism without addressing the topic of drugs," Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper has earned the reputation of a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked them to publish bold reports, not afraid of censorship, and the readers were attracted to the fact that in this edition they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riods received the prestigious award of Maria Murs Kabo for his reporter work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage in the investigation of Mexico's drug trafficking, wherever it leads.
He frankly confessed that he was scared.
"I want to live further," he said at the CPJ award.
Narcotrading in Sinaloa is "a way of life," he said in October last year in an interview with Romtimeento TV.
"You must accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist - either so or you just make fools."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodos staff are bored by Waldes, a joker who scolded like a loader in a port, a friend who is generous in embrace and advice, a teacher who knew how to live.
They relied on the order they had set on.
He had to always wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, a bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: he was destroyed by love for the established order once?
His death made them doubt their calculations of how better to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like when you know their wives, children, their legal business and underground airfields for the transportation of drugs.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorques.
The result, even in the best times, was a high level of self-censorship and the desire for self-preservation.
We must believe our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riodocer Andres Villareal, is that "the circumstance can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier is happening."
The old rules, he says, do not act anymore in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracrus, Guerrero and other states where there is a poisonous mixture of profitable smuggling paths, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
Landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodocer employees gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to make cell phones: a few days earlier it became known that espionage programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, are used in Mexico to track journalists and community activists.
On the outside, two policemen are hiding in the shade of a tree from 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were instructed by the government to guard the Riodocer office, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois quarter of Kuliakana.
Some journalists asked if these policemen were among the 50% of the order ministers, about whom the governor himself said that they can not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to the mountainous area, which de facto is under the control of the gang of drug dealers.
In the nearest issue of Riodos counted on three main topics.
This is the murder of the brother of the former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinalow.
They also had the disclosure of government expenditures concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group abduction of people in one of the most expensive restaurants of Kuliacan, in a quarter from the prosecutor's office.
Officially it was not announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of government during almost the past century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of "El Chapo" Guzman eluded the cloud of the military.
A few months ago, readers would look for a column of Valdes with the most reliable information about kidnapping.
"Previously we would already know what happened," says the 46-year-old Villareal, for his lean physique called "El Flaco."
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdes' Cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the killing of journalists, because the employees have become what they have never thought of becoming: activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after being killed by Valdes.
Found burned body, and the authorities said that it is he, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On this day, the director of Bohorques was in Washington, trying to enlist international support in the Valdes case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
After that, she asked her not to give more tasks to cover the government's activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdes has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "encouraged" by organized crime, its accomplices in the government and indifferent society.
In his latest book Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just killed by gangs of drug dealers; they do it by order of politicians and security services in conspiracy with organized crime.
The Press Protection Committee "Articulo 19" believes that half of the attacks against journalists last year were committed by order of police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, killings frighten people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamalipas.
On her body found a note, presumably written on behalf of the Cartel Zetas: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her cut head.
Some publications preferred to close, as the newspaper "El North" in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on to watch as El Manjana from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Siudad Huarez publicly addressed the drug-carriers using an editorial article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists left their native states or country in general.
This is a tormenting decision.
In exile it is difficult to find a job, and they still look at the danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it is obvious, happened to the photographer Ruben Espinoz, who was killed in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after the flight from Veracrus.
Those who remain and continue to work daily balance between risky decisions.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he is scared to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the Riodocer publishers sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of skirmishes between the opposing gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left behind, according to confirmed data, 19 corpses.
The war continued to flare up, as was promised in a series of messages from the cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news via the mobile phone on the Riodos website.
The next day it was necessary to remake the first page.
Not far away the sirens yelled - another skirmish in the vicinity.
Bohorques looked at whether the police guards were ready for their defense.
If they were frightened, they didn't show it.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the review of all Sinaloa, the Riodos staff continued his work.
"How can you think of closing," said Bohorkes, "if the day Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to make a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, though terrifying.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros discovered by a Canadian miner, survived so well that experts called it "Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown, and to say that he had, in some way, the dark past.
In the report published in the journal "Modern Biology," it was described as the most well-preserved of Tirephorus in the history of findings and one of the best specimens of the dinosaur in the world.
This fossil is a newly found copy of the nodosaur, who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has stunned the researchers who call it really remarkable.
This herbivorous thyrophorus is the most well-preserved fossil of this species in the history of findings, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
It was found by Sean Fank when he worked at the Millennium mine of Sankor near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossils discovered by him were sent to the Royal Tyrrellian Paleontological Museum.
The next six years, the animal was discovered inside the earthen block with a weight of 2,500 fus (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"It's only a bit of sneak, and you can almost believe that he sleeps," said the leading author of Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved specimens of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.
While studying his skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to considerable danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful armor-coated dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective coloring, which is also used by many animals of our days.
This would allow him to merge faster with the environment and avoid meeting his enemies, experts say, believing that he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, the age of 110 million years, belonging to the family of nodozaurs, was widely covered in printing in May, and is now at the exhibition at the Royal Tyrrelli Paleontological Museum.
The scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name of Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group, who spent more than 7000 hours in his painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of scales and armored plates on his body.
They found a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper being was darker than its lower side.
Although protective coloring and well spread, the discovery was a surprise, because the size of the dinosaur Borealopelta significantly exceeds the size of living animals with protective color.
It may be assumed that carnivorous dinosaurs were so actively hunted for this dinosaur that evolution preferred to camouflage confrontation as a way of survival.
But most of the modern animals with protective coloring - for example, deer, zebras or armor-bearers - much smaller and are more affordable prey, which indicates that the nodozaur had to seriously fight for survival.
"Serious threat from predators for a massive, powerful dinosaur shell shows how dangerous were the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the scale of the dinosaur also indicates that his skin had to be reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was carried into the sea, where he sank and his back fell to the bottom of the ocean.
In those days, Alberta was as warm as it is now in the south of Florida, and the rivers and oceans were most likely spread far further into the land than now.
"This nodozaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with the preserved scale skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"As a result, now the animal looks almost the same as it looked then, in the Early Cretaceous period.
It is not necessary to especially resort to imagination to recreate it, it is only necessary to squint slightly, and you can almost believe that he sleeps.
The melode is an epoch when giant teropuds, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two feet wandered around the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, a tyrannosaur rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, on the tyreophora could hunt someone of his formidable ancestors.
They include an acrotanostor, a 38-foot-length monster weighing six tons (11.5 meters) of a weight.
Scientists whose latest discoveries are published in the journal "Modern biology" believe that Borealopelta was carried away after death to the sea and mummified in the silt.
The creature was found by Sean Fank when he worked at the Millennium mine near Forte McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, March 21, 2011.
According to the museum staff, this is the most well-preserved thyrophore in the world, together with the skin and the shell, and it is intact, from the snout to the hips.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes out of their shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous tyrephorus was hard on what is now Canada, until the spilled river took it to the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his shell with precision to the smallest details.
The petrified remains of this particular copy are so well preserved that skin residues still cover the bumpy armored plates along the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Gearshko wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is rare as winning the lottery.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing it seems.
The petrified skin residues still cover the bumpy armored plates that sow the animal's skull.
His right front leg stretched along the side, five fingers on it are pulled up.
I can count the scales on his sole.
Mikheil Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition Telewizja Republika, which posted on its channel in YouTube video with his performance.
Saakashvili spoke at the event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know the Polish, although he tried to start speaking in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of Georgia's cooperation with Poland, as well as spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived his citizenship, the opposing politician learned while in the United States.
It is not yet known how he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents.
Earlier, former governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill in any questionnaires.
The term of investigation in the case of Vainziher and Olkhovik extended until January
The term of preliminary investigation in the case of Yevgeny Olkhovik, co-owner of the Renova group of companies, and Boris Vainziher, head of the energy holding "T Plus," has been extended to January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basman Court is considering prolonging the arrest of the accused.
At the meeting the representative of the SK announced the decision to extend the term of the preliminary investigation last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to withdraw and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as carrying out investigative actions on the territory of several regions of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Vainziher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of CJSC "Integrated Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "Vimpelcom," transferred bribes to the top officials of the Republic of Komi for establishing the most favorable tariffs for thermal and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinziher and Olkhovik were detained, staged in Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped the investigation and was prosecuted by federal search.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question "Chich streets?"
On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the bottom of her heart.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking at the Facebook tape on the phone.
She came across the post of someone from high school.
It was said, "Policemen have just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he still lies in the middle of the street.
Paying attention to the fact that no one else in her tape has nurtured this information, puzzled, she closed the Facebook and opened a Twitter.
There were many user reposts in her tape with @TheePharoah nick.
Raper from Great St. Louis in real time covered on tweet the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed black eighteen-year-old teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's lifeless body, spreading among the street where it will be four hours.
"This is wildness," Ferrel thought.
But death was not new to her and her circle.
She put off the phone, and later in the evening she returned to tweets that people were going to Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the signaling tape and the screaming people and the man who claimed that he was the father of Brown, who was holding a poster with the words: "Police from Ferguson has just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast as a police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
On another video another policeman," she said, "went the trigger of the rifle and yelled, "I'll kill you all..." animals!
"This is a non-standard situation," Ferrel said from her own memories.
This is not such a murder as those to which we are used to and can be called typical.
At that moment, I felt chilled.
I was angry and weeping.
She took the return flight ticket and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson in the next three years was the theme of the new documentary "Chich Streets?" which will be released on August 11.
This is a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and endurance from the point of view of people living in the community and flooded streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel rode in Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower and a wreath of color, they remembered the conversation that had been leading until this morning countless times, and about the experience of the blacks and their position.
She remembers, as she said, "Remember how I told you how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We are now going to Ferguson because the policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong.
"I couldn't help but take it," said Ferrel later.
"That's what's happening today is the culmination of what happened before.
She must know about it, see it and be brought up on it.
It must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also to understand the different levels of the experience of the blacks and their provisions and what we have to do to become free to free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she personally does not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel that I would have given her a bad service if I had fenced it from it.
When they arrived at Ferguson, they made the first stop at South Florissant Road, on a site located across the road from the police station, which became a sort of tent camp, while the activists were waiting for reports of the final non-harassment of Darren Wilson's officer.
There Ferrel and his daughter joined the local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped them be handed over to the protesters.
Little by little, Ferrel's consciousness has broken the form of a new type of activism.
"My activism has completely changed after August 9," she said, noting that being a student at the University of Missouri-Saint-Louis, she was the President of the Association of Sanitar students, representatives of national minorities, and was engaged in food justice and health in the field of black communities.
I had no experience of the organizer.
It came by itself.
A few weeks later, Ferrel met Saba Folayan, one of her co-directors, at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that she and her main cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Fairreli wanted to document the events.
Ferrere came to mind the question: "Do you want to document, or try to find a story on which you can play?
This skepticism was inspired by numerous people, often white, who came to the community in order to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We have heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson do not get into the center of attention, and wanted to do it differently.
At that time, Folayan had already united with his co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for her activism on the issues of those sentenced to death.
His participation aroused sympathy for the project at Ferrel and six more locals with whom the project team "Chick streets"? It has been in touch for the years since Brown's assassination.
"In this documentary, not someone speaks for us or with us, we say it yourself," Davis said.
This was the most important thing for me, how these people will be presented, because it is how I will be represented myself.
And although the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrel's experience in an effort to show that the movement is not about the leader-rescuer, but about how the community unites, as Folayan said, it turned out to be the most open of the film participants.
As a result, in the "Chest street?" The unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel's life are shown, for example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrel, laughing at how she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I realized that when you do such work and humanize the blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrel's history again discusses and accentuates the role of black homosexual woman in a broader context of the movement "Life of Blacks is important."
Two of the three founders of the movement - those who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter on social networks after the murder of black teenager Treivon Martin in 2012 - consider themselves homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in leadership positions support all this movement," Ferrel says. And that's because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.
Folayan agreed with this statement, noting that the movement, in fact, is supported by black women and many homosexual black women.
However, she insists that this is not a case of positive discrimination, and that Ferrel was not elected the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
"She was the man who awakened this energy," she said.
On the other hand, it is not a coincidence that it was in the forefront, because when
You can feel its energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long been no cameras, but there are complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrerrell will be on a probation period for the overlap of the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place that he calls the house, simply: "Bardak."
She still clung to the speech she had learned when she came out into Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We must win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.
Two El Salvador football players disqualified for the bite of US players

The defender Henry Romero was the first to be distinguished.
The Salvadorer bit the attacker Josie Altidore, then pinched him by the chest.
Then midfielder Seren, when serving a corner in his area, bit the U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches, and Seren - for six.
The meeting ended with the victory of the Americans with the score 2: 0, reports Goal.com.
Appearance similarity: the artist creates portraits with the help of DNA Chelsea Manning
In the center of the Hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York from the ceiling on the wire hang people's faces - white, black and brown, all something imperceptibly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dwie Harborg of smears from the cheeks and hair trims sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent cuts from Fort Levenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year term for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which covered on August 2, is called "The emergence of similarity."
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dia Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama softened the sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
Having analyzed the DNA received from Manning with the help of a computer program, and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons that could have people with such a genome, Deuy Harborg created a deep, albeit difficult to perceive the manifesto, dedicated not only the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of their interpretation and ingerent determinism of these interpretations - but also the concept.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but from her teenagers openly said that she considered herself a woman, in 2013 was sentenced to 20 episodes, including six violations of the espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one of her photos was known: a grainy black and white selfie on which Manning in the platinum touch of a wig, clearly feeling embarrassing, sitting behind the wheel of the car; with this photograph she and began to associate it.
In 2015, Duy-Harborg completed her 2012 project "Unknown Persons Vids" with great success.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people with the help of court evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, emitting DNA from this debris and creating images of how these people could look.
And then she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," Deui-Hagorg explained at the preliminary screening of the new press exhibition.
At that time Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her muse sitting in prison became friends in correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of comics "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Canungo, who portrayed how in the future the president will soften the punishment of Chelsea and she will be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the release of the book was a pleasant surprise after seven years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong in the fact that the exhibition opens right now, when Donald Trump announces war to people who reveal secret information in the government, and invents new ways to kindle in Twitter the enmity he is designed to soften.
When Deuy Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said that "it is accidental that nothing happens."
In a statement written on the wall of the galley, the huge signature of Manning downward (with a heart instead of a point over "i" in her surname) calls to put an end to the "automatic division on the basis of sex, race, sexual orientation and culture."
On the opposite side - its mitochondrial DNA, a long goosecase from pencil C, G and A.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientifically exquisitely expressed artist), Devyi-Harborg hoped to show how we all are surprisingly similar, at least in its biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open the genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Deui Harborg; her video work of the "False Memories" is also exhibited here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibition, which is able to know in the same room, is the novel mentioned above in comics.
On it Manning in the style of King Kong appears above the building of the correctional Barracks of the United States with a loudspeaker in hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it is written there.
"So never stop."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says the artist who greets us from Philadelphia.
"I still have goosebumps on my skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was seen in comics - but when she comes, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacs gathered, like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as well as everything at the exhibition up to a height (5"2, the height of Manning), on which the pencil was drawn genetic haplogroups.
"Previously I'd hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Dey Harborg about the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that was formed around Chelsea as a movement that stood behind her liberation."
Professors of Northwest University and Oxford University employee are looking for police on charges of murder
According to the police, there is a national raid on a professor of Northwest University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are wanted as suspects due to the fact that in a luxurious room in Chicago a dead person was found.
According to the protocols of the Cook District Court, on Monday, orders were issued for the premeditated murder without the right to release on bail of forty-legged Windham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, the twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after he was inflicted multiple pricking wounds.
The warning released by the Chicago police department says that the body was found on July 27.
The policeman received a call, they arrived in the complex of apartments "Grand Plaza" and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating the death of stabbing wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latham has held the position of Adjunct Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, Vice President of the University of Communications, said in a statement sent by e-mail that Latham is on administrative leave and that he is prohibited to go to the campuses of the North-West University.
"Now this is a criminal case, which is investigated by authorized persons, and North-West University cooperates with the investigation," - said Kabbage.
Warren works as a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in a statement sent by e-mail: "We communicated with the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. Investigative Bodies.
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and want him to surrender.
The communication department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he was very advised to surrender to the authorities.
The police have speculations about their location, but our attempts to find them are intensified, - said Guglielmi.
According to Gullemi, local, regional and federal authorities help in search of suspects.
According to Gullemi, the police called the administrator of the building "Grand Plaza," who just received a mysterious report that something happened in the room 1008.
Policemen called the crime scene horrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident itself took place on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lathem and the victim have connected the relationship," said Gullelmi.
The Grand-Plaza manual issued an appeal to the guests, which reported: "At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collects information about the victim and considers a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the roadmap WADA in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSAD), will be fulfilled in the near future.
"Some stage in the implementation of the requirements was passed, RUSAD got the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (anti-doping agency of Great Britain).
The WADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to restore the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the terms of the resumption of the RUSAD and was recently published on the website of this organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could represent difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian ad-ping structures should publicly recognise the results of the investigation conducted by the WADA of Canadian lawyer Richard Mclaren, which stated that doping in Russian sport is controlled by the state.
Touching on this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating, as our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what was not. "
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaliy Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In an interview with the Russian edition "Rsport" Smirnov recognized the problems that had previously occurred in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Unconditionally, no one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA removed RUSAD from doping control in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the Moscow office of the organization in July, CEO of WADA Olivier Niggly said that RUSAD "moves in the right direction" to restore its work.

Stoltenberg Recognizes Deterioration of Relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4 by the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, it is the Russian authorities that are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine."
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that the dialogue with Russia is possible, and the further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that the relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and accused the US Congress of this.
Ekaterinburg Metro Masters New Way of Payment
In October, travel to the Yekaterinburg metro will be able to pay with a bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, general director of "I-Network" in an interview with the "Oblastnaya Gazeta."
Our goal is to introduce the same system of payment for the World Cup in the 2018 subway as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the championship, to use the metro with the help of their bank cards, without buying tokens and not standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another "Uberom"
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among her startup staff in the field of e-commerce, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"It has never been consistent and objective," said Errett, who is in San Francisco, a company of 75 people in San Francisco, who is engaged in e-commerce in the field of hair care.
Therefore, she appealed to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of start-ups in the field of work with personnel, which help companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software, which is the purpose of which is the measurement of the recruitment of employees, they allow companies to make express surveys, to contact certain teams and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to avoid top management and to contact the management directly.
"Now we have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company? - says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of the startup "Gling" from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure the recruitment of employees.
Errett said she had reached a greater understanding of what its employees think and feel in three years of use of Glint.
In addition to the express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a thermal map of the company and shows in a visual form which departments have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are gradually aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another "Uber," who was involved in the scandal, when the former employee published a post in a blog, which described the aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the estimates of the Internet portal, let's talk about paying for financial technologies, the global management industry, regulation and compliance by 2020 could cost more than $118.7 billion.
Startup "Convercenta" from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the background of the fall of the reputation of "Ubera."
The Convercenta has almost 600 customers, including 'Airbnb', 'Microsofti' and "Tesla".
Recently, the clients appeared "Uber."
As well as the Glinté, "Convercenta" allows companies to send individual order surveys of personnel opinions, collect confidential responses in real time and view thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, complaints go directly to the management.
"The Public Opinion Court has intercepted the power of the inspectors," said Patrick Queenlan, founder and president of the company.
If it turns out that the company is ill-treated to employees or behaves unethically, even if the inspector does not intervene, the company may face expensive consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, the outflow of employees and lawsuits, said Queenlan.
"Ruby Tuesday", a network of restaurants, where more than 25,000 employees work in 500 establishments, used the Convercenta for more than a year to make sure that the employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and offer an easy way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if the employee wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or mail head office, file an official complaint and hope that she will be treated seriously.
Often it was a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of the legal department of the company "Ruby Tuesday," who said that there was no normal way to track the complaints of employees.
Now that the company uses the service "Convercenta," the problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment and unfair remuneration - you can find and deal with them quickly.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees," said Vitrano, who is the head of the risk management team of the network "Ruby Tuesday."
And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees.
According to Kwynland, the companies began to take seriously the ethics, values and inculcation of employees in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen failed due to ethical violations as a result of the "Dela Enron."
But only when "social networks have been mass distribution," did the companies realize that they would not be able to keep their dirty baldness from viral distribution on the network.
"Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people have used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint' and 'Convercenta offer their software as a service, taking a regular fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to receive the approval of venture investors, who supported both startups.
In February, the Convercenta received $10 million of its funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital's, which resulted in the company's total capital reaching $47 million.
Glint' received $10 million in November from the Bessemer Venture Partners, which resulted in the company's total capital of $60 million.
This investment is hardly surprising when considering the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing amount of research shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than they used to be.
In the markets with hard competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just a necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated, and that they devote their time to companies with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in the company, feel that they are heard, and that the work they do brings results, they are more trying to make such a company successful," says Nina McQueen, Vice President for Global Benefits and Satisfaction of Employees in the LinkedIn, where they are used and ?verConcenta, and Glint.
Investors get income when companies from their portfolio go well; companies do well when employees are committed and involved.
If the analytical instruments of a third party promise to increase the loyalty and incurability of employees, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to cultural experts in workplaces, it is important to have data on the inculcency of employees.
But the data is useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if the company asks employees for feedback, it may give the impression that changes are coming.
And if the changes do not come fast enough, or do not come at all, disappointment may develop, and employees will lose interest.
"If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be ready to hold 4000 conversations," says Russell Rath, President of Advising the Management Company, who had to see how companies make a mistake, relying too relying on data collection.
"Because if you don't go to the end, the co-workers will guess, "You heard me that you have heard me?"
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I ben't it all the same?
According to Errett, the company "Madison Reed", which now conducts monthly surveys of employees, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports about the problem with the help of "Glint."
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce a communication training to solve problems.
The company "Ruby Tuesday" gets new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it to keep employees in the industry, known for its high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose the company.
In Barnaul open a new asphalt on the avenue Krasnoarmeysky
In Barnaul, they took drastic measures to eliminate the causes of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where the pit twice appeared on the recently asphalted roadway (crossing with the street Youth), it was decided to "open."
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks occurred due to the fact that the land in the area of the unemployed unexploited network.
According to Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Road Management, Improvement, Transport and Communications Ivan Garmat, for detailed examination and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse will conduct a detailed examination.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the formwork will be restored and the formwork of homeless communications.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruinz team has to deal longer because of the fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day
Time is approaching eleven evenings; a crowd of football players from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the new training fields of the team located on the campus.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts, revealing their backs, shiny from the shower after the tense first day of the sports camp.
For many players of the team, these minutes are idle breaks in the middle of the day.
After three hours of training, players will go back to the hostels to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to Wasserman's football center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned on Tuesday, the coach of the team Bruins Jim Mora said: "In the next three days these guys wait for a meat grinder."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association has cancelled the training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the load for players, actually lengthened their working day - at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three trainings of the California University in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 pm to fit in the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two workouts a day has become more days with one training, and Bruins moves the beginning of the camp for almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of the Mora in Westwald.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 trainings until August 20 inclusive before starting the official preparations for the first game of the season against the team of the University of Texas A&M in September.
Mora said that he supports the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that because of him in the tight schedule of players appeared another item.
"During three or four days we give them this great burden, it is a serious test," said Mora.
"And they just overcame it, they work, they are wonderful guys.
I think that when we live until the sabbath, and we have more time, it will be really great.
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; it is a considerable task, as its fields are in direct visibility with the adjoining parking and from the neighboring Laskin Center, an expensive hotel, which has already been bombed with football balls that have overcome the protective grid behind the gate.
Players from "Bruinza" must occupy a hotel starting from this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have guards," said Mora.
This is a serious problem and I do not exaggerate the danger, suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record a training on the video.
If you have a video recording workout, it's very serious.
But we will have security there and will be guarded at the parking number 8.
We will do everything we can do with what we have.
I will not be too much to worry about it.
We have a plan.
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg are discharged from hospitals
All victims of the St. Petersburg Metro attack were discharged from hospitals in April.
This was reported in the press service of Vice Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the data as of the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, "TV Center" reports.
Recall that the explosion in the metro station of St. Petersburg thundered April 3 of this year.
Bomb exploded terrorist suicide Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack 15 people were killed, as well as the performer himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall that on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the metro to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport security, in particular, increasing the number of frames of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious to mystical, independent experts, and show their conclusions under original posts, said on Thursday the largest social network in the world, which is trying to fight the so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said that it begins to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them for inspection and may show the results of fact-checking under the initial post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways to spread the so-called fake news, which, in the opinion of many, influenced the presidential elections of 2016 in the United States.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after the French voters were misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, before the September elections, they announced their support for the plan to fine social networks if they did not promptly remove the posts inciting hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook announced the testing of a new algorithm of fact-checking, which was launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which messages are disputed by independent inspectors, people want to have a broader context to make reasonable judgments on what they read and share," wrote Sarah Sue, Facebook news manager in her block.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the function of "associated articles" and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a romance comic book: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the tiny castle of Scotty was filmed in the music video "Squeeze," and in the 70s and 80s served as a refuge for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy place in the valley of the river Beul in the county of Kent, he watched the turbulent history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, Yorkshire with a spear hair and with a tendency to historical documents, a novel comic.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
The "lock in England" covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Eidian era and tells about the families that lived in Skotney; each story illustrated one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevic, Bryoni May Smith, William Exley, Bekki Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first Rhodes book, which is based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote "The Thick Bowls of a Dead Man and Other Stories" - a collection of documents from the British Library; this project unexpectedly touched him to the bottom of his heart.
"I could only be stirred by the fingerprint on the edge of the letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for Yakobits," he says.
"It's his fingerprint"
And the letters are always smelled of smoke, for in those days the fire was kindled for the light.
And in 300 years, in the future, it seems to you that you are also there.
Ah, how I love the archives!"
For a man covered by such a passion for old papers, to get support from the National Fund and the English Art Studies Council and to live in the castle for four months ("Honestly, I have a little gone there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle for days, walked through the archives and considered numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of hyen on the walls or bottles that have been in the drows for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talked to the foresters, gardeners and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Skotney Castle is not very studied because the National Fund got full access to it only in 2006, when the last heir died, Elisabeth Hassi.
When Rhodes arrived there in ten years, the staff just began to deal with the archive, which he describes as "that the aristocrats for centuries fell into the attic."
The diaries, the letters of the times of the British Empire, the maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but here two families fought for this birch.
It happens so, guys!"
In some stories of the collection, the castle becomes a starting point for wider research in English history: for example, in the "Worker," the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is information about the revolt that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called "The Knight's Families of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The cross-country uprising began in these places, and I thought that revolt was a suitable beginning.
Maybe they were tied up?"
Other subjects are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, the "Life," which tells about the priest-Jesuit, which the Darrelov family hid seven years during the English Reformation.
Or the "Contrabandist," about the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrel, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by typing the coffin with stones (it was discovered a few years later, when the coffin was dug up).
Darrels are the favorite Rhodes family of all that Scotty inhabited: "Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect swindler, always went into debt and spent money on what they could not afford.
In different generations, the Darrel men solved their problems with their debts, marrying wealthy elderly women - I imagine them as a company of cute guys who know how to care for the heirs of great fortunes."
After finishing work in the castle Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to get a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyamenmyaki - a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it was overgrown with forest again.
But Skotney remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: the devil, I have to return to real life again."
Fifteen largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha-bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC Open, seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the organizations that came out of the ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization uniting credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia," which is headed by well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, recognized, by the way, following the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and deputy on the number of drafted bills.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, involving a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, said that, according to the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the possibilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, there was also criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify itself with the revocation of licenses from some banks, which, however, was objected by the representative of the Central Bank: many leaders of the bank, in particular, Vneshprombank, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive attitude to the relations with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, having disagreed with the ARB policy, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia," noting that "the effectiveness of the work of the ARB is hollowing at a low level, and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually carried out."
Depositors will be better
What will end the matter?
We will immediately answer the main question that arises at the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or next to it: the depositors do not threaten anything, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov, head of "Russia," is known for his scrupulousness in all that concerns the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional, who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the Central Bank is present at the annual activities of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of "regionals."
Apparently, there is no significant upheavals in the personnel-organizational plan.
Undoubtedly, the ARB falls into a difficult financial and management situation after it loses such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - an organization that defends the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation as a whole.
It is impossible to say that in the association "Russia" with open arms, they are ready to accept new members on any terms, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe want too much to want"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "literally the next day representatives of the ARB banks who left the ARB asked me to consider the possibility to increase the potential of our association "Russia."
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is underway, proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
There and let's decide.
Anatoly Aksakov also stressed that "he does not stay for the chair," called Georgy Luntovsky, the new head of the renewed Russia Association, who leaves the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in the Crimea, plans to stop vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow, at an extraordinary meeting of the Association Council "Russia," where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress "Russia."
The entry of cars with gasoline engine in major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy Minister of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with gasoline engine in the major cities of Russia will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually increase the ecological class.
And there the concept immediately switch to zero emissions.
I believe that technically we are not ready for this.
The question is another: from what year?
This is the same at the level of slogans phrase - let's ban.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will the whole city be closed?
"After 20 years - I don't know, maybe it will happen," Prime quotes the Minister.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, submitted to the government by General Director of PJSC KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, - the use of cars with combustion offices in large cities and resorts.
Washington changes the rules for obtaining a green card.
As reported by the media, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so by changing how the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide the benefits of candidates who own English, have money resources that allow them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy, - said Trump, according to the American media.
The appearance of sex robots is real and it should bother us
We did not have time to think that 2017 could not be worse, a new report on technological successes in the production of sex robots was released.
Mda.
Sex robots are now in the spotlight.
The Responsible Robotnik Foundation (FRR) has recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharki, the honored professor of robotics and artificial intelligence of the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take them seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of robots, the shape of the nipple and the type of nails.
"People giggling about this, but the firms already in large numbers send them to consumers, and soon we will see them much more," - said Sharki at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable fellows in robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas, which is controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "set" their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the eye color and shape of the robot's teat to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have "personality," compared to which Stepford's wife would seem very progressive, bothers even more.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the company "RealBotix robot" allows users to configure in robots of quality, which they find attractive - for example shyness.
There are also robots of Roxxxy Gold, developed by "True Companion," which come with already programmed individuality - for example, "Cold Farrah" gives the impression of shy, and "Windie's Wilde" has a "brib" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that is perfect for yours," - enthusiastically reports the site "True Companion."
So she loves what you love, does not love what you do not love, and so on.
She has a change of mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she can "be in the mood"!"
In the emergence of sex robots, much is of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most concerned about the subordinate image of a woman, an association with rape, which causes the possession of the Cold (read: resisting) Faro.
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) maybe a vibrator, why men can't have Roxxxy?" - says on the website.
But these sex robots are not only fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicates something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with subordination as an optional addition.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain at the periphery of consumer culture.
But what is reported to us from the periphery may be very instructive with regard to the meanings of the epoch in which we live.
And many people are not bad and not aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
This is not a coincidence - that these complex sex robots appeared exactly when the rights of women around the world were threatened when the White House is a president who boasts of what comes to women.
The worst thing in the TV series "The story of the maid" is not graphic images, twisted bodies and depressed eyes, namely, how realistic this vision seems realistic.
The Republic of Galad is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The purpose of the sex robot industry is to achieve such a physical likeness to real women (only with the proportion of porn stars), which allows technology.
Their creators want them to seem people to the touch to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is with their "characters" robots are not similar to real women.
They cannot break with their partners or leave them.
They have neither their own life nor biography - nothing that could point to independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, these are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, are maids.
A native of Los Angeles Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been playing for the national team of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Championships in basketball, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with the portal BeBasket general manager of "blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he will not come under family circumstances.
We will go to Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we do not want to take someone we do not know.
"This situation will give opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Recall: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian team took a record sixth place in the Eurobasket 2013 and for the first time hit the World Basketball Championship, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the U.S. native scored an average for the game 15.4 points, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter ceased to play for the national team of Ukraine since the resignation of the head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
Male Eurobasket-2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
Ukrainian team will hold their matches of the group tournament on Earth promised.
The wards of Yevgeny Murzin in Group B will have five fights: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which she lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
To depict Mita Romney seems very reasonable
In the era of Trump, the common place was that political disputes that polarized the American electorate were divided by some families at the micro-level.
Between the Thanksgiving Day and Christmas, American newspapers were full of columns about how to cope with terrible relatives voting for Trump.
We all seem to be tense so that we will soon burst.
Less talk about Trump's ability to connect families.
I am writing about this because my cousin, the left-wing views of the poetess from Chicago, who had long been on knives with the Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unification in the fight against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
Under Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother, with whom she argued about politics for decades, sudden and strangely found themselves on the same side.
During supper it is certainly good; but I can't help thinking that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump breathed strength into the left, but the deforming effect of his rule can all move us to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop hitting his tricks.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly seem to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself on the fact that I am very bored today by the old-fashioned madness of Mitt Romney - with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14-percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax declaration looks like) - compared to Trump and both, it seems very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will be just enough to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the children to the carousel in Central Park - the biggest carousel in the farm of the New York Parks Department and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you do not need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the fiberglass pictures on the central drum - the grimace clowns and animals, which, bent, look at themselves in horror on their backs, are extremely miserable, and ringing music, strangely enough, delighted.
So many well-known things in this city are disappointed: views from skyscrapers are obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too good to tremble, and the reality of the city does not have time for a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day I learned that the Suiss-cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (thematic pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" is not counting), but a large circular intersection in North London.
A carousel in Central Park - it is still an unusual, magical place in which a child of two years old, a child of eleven years and two women in forty can have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the merry-go-round, I would have set the top five, but fortunately nobody asked me to do so.
And in the department store this week I was asked before holding a card on the terminal, to evaluate your "experience" of purchases on a scale from one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street all the same plus the option to accompany the score of a teat of 15 percent - this is for order at the rack.
As a result, not only slows down neutral interaction in the idea, but also has to make a personal attitude in a situation that does not imply it.
The poor seller at the department store smiled comfortably while I was tired of apprehensively assessing her experience of giving her a credit card of five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of chest pain
Pistorius leaves the prison because of his visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on the wrists, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of a fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted for intentional murder after the prosecutor's appeal for the initial sentence for unintentional murder.
He killed Stencamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the door of the toilet room in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said that he took his girlfriend for the night thief hiding in his toilet.
The Prosecutor's Office announced its intention to file another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretorius, which, according to her, is too mild.
The Prosecutor General's Office said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and appeals will be considered this year.
The term of Pretorius may increase by 15 years, if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
NTV journalist suspected of beating a journalist is elected not leaving
The policemen of the capital elected a preventive measure in the form of a non-exit subscription for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvozzhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"In the course of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under the article. 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("failures") against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Leisure named after Gorky, a measure of suppression in the form of a subscription for no-show and proper behavior was elected," Wolf said.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for disobedience of the police was drawn up against the suspect.
On Wednesday, August 2, during the live broadcast to the Airborne Day a drunk man approached the correspondent and hit the face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the Airborne Forces.
According to Razvozzhaev, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to delay the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
In the morning of August 1, a group of people who put tents in the wrong place, including two citizens of Bulgaria, was detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the TV channel "Bi-Ti-Vi" that the citizens of Bulgaria then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the control over the free camping and already impose serious penalties to all who are caught during the parking lot in an undesigned place.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accuses US Vice President of rhetoric during the Cold War
The statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Penx were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is regrettable to state that Washington is sinking deeper into the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War, which are completely cut off from reality," the statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry reads.
Thus, the Foreign Ministry responded to Pens' words about the "Russian threat" and attempts to reshape the borders of the borders said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West, or with Russia" and the unobviousness of the thesis about the allegedly non-alternative accession of the whole South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
The Russian diplomats also reminded that it was the United States that violated international law, using force to reject Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another focus of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop the shelving of Russia and its foreign policy, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests," the statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry reads.
Feldsher suffered in an accident with an ambulance in Moscow region
The accident occurred in Stupino near Moscow, as a result of a collision of foreign cars with the ambulance carriage suffered from a paramedic.
Today about 08:10 MSK there was a collision of the car Mitsubishi with the ambulance carriage in the city of Stupino, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the car "soon" turned over," - said TASS in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region.
At the scene of an accident law enforcement officers work, the circumstances of the incident are cleared.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son at the construction site, filling in a cellophane bag.
In the evening of August 3, the police department received a report from a local resident that he found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
"At the scene went law enforcement officers and doctors who promptly brought the child to a medical institution," - said in the Odessa Head of the National Police.
Doctors have determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
In the course of priority operational and investigative measures identified the personality of the woman - 36-year-old local resident.
It is also found that the woman has three more young children.
As noted in the Governor's Office, in the field of view of law enforcement, the family had not previously entered and was not on a special account.
Currently, police establish the circumstances and reasons that forced the woman to do, after which a procedural decision will be made.
Now the baby is under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into the garbage disposal.
Gregory Leps: "I'm going to fight, although 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Gregory Leps will celebrate his 55th anniversary next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked with the observer of "Izvestia."
I remember how your "poltinnik" was noted.
A special tent in the "Luzhniki," Gloria Heinor sang for the birthday man, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You probably pretended to be, as you would like to spend your next five years.
Have the plans come true?
If we talk about a profession, it was a good period.
I worked a lot, three times I went with tours the whole country, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, now I'm not the one that, say, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks do not deceive.
Sing as I sang in my 30, it becomes heavier.
Nonetheless, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I, with new people, I think, come to a different level.
With them you and the new album are recorded, the first in three years.
Yes, the work on it is now underway.
Actually, we have already recorded everything in my studio and will now send it to Los Angeles.
He called "What are you so serious?" according to the song of the same name, which is written together with Timati.
She is not yet quite ready, so we have not laid it out yet.
Let's do it later, when we remove the clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of anniversary concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall."
To your new record handed a cool American drummer Chris Coulman.
Do you seem to have wanted him to attract him to your tour?
In my opinion, Coulman today is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world.
He came to my studio, wrote down his parties.
I offered him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in different projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward excessive conditions, to put it mildly.
It was about fees from €35 thousand. up to €45 thousand per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And he found a great drummer Max Malyshev.
In general, it is better to feed their own (smiles).
At times I want to fight to any of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
Western music magazines are written about it, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came, with another performance technique."
Your album comes down in Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Do you try to lift this ban?
Now, to be honest, I do nothing.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I really feel sorry that I can't get into America.
I have said more than once that I was studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We are not dull them, but we have no such experience, schools.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been set at all the tasks that have always been solved by American musicians.
They sought the highest quality sound.
And I try to follow the same principles.
Now for some reason, the UK refused to enter me for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa every year to the British embassy, so that I am allowed to go there again and most importantly - there to work.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not custom, but poster, right?
Yes, in Monte Carlo there is a good Sporting hall, I have already played there once.
Now they have invited again, and, as far as I know, all the tickets for the concert are already sold out.
At the "Randev Laima Vaikula," which will begin on July 20 in Jurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and I responded, of course.
Laima is a wonderful singer and a great woman who knows how to serve herself with a beautiful vocal, and even in a whisper.
After tours and jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be quite different.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same serve as he did himself.
Only a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
Our famous musician Timur Vedernikov will associate me.
I will try to attract to participate in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about this, we have a good relationship, but he is a busy person, so we'll see how it will work.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenshikov gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Maybe then you'll write down an album of his things?
Boris Borisovich is a beautiful man and a magnificent musician.
I intersected with him several times and asked: can I sing this or that song of his?
He said, "Grigori, I am writing songs to make them come true."
Please try, sing.
Probably it is interesting to record such an album.
So far I have no such task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may do such a project.
If you do not focus entirely on the affairs of your producer center.
I think, until you have realized his potential, haven't signed contracts with all the artists who are interested in you?
There are a number of performers that I would dream of having under my wing, but they are independent, well-established people.
Do you mean Sergei Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can not agree with something with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the "Voice."
We have concluded a contract with him and work.
In our pop music such singers are rare.
It will be a pity to be sincere if it does not reach the heights that are worthy.
I try to pick him a repertoire, I shoot videos.
Hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, weep for poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they are not reached great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the output they will receive a recorded album, several videos.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money they invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them achieves commercial success and pays me the interest we agreed in the contract.
But if this does not happen, I am not going to block the oxygen.
Let all work, break through, prove how once I proved.
If tomorrow you will be offered to make a tour of Ukraine and guarantee entry into the country, will you go?
I am still invited there.
Basically we are talking about closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, on my own conviction, flew to Syria on the plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that you need to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will lie.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics will think about me.
I sincerely regret that this situation we have turned out to be with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and must be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to work, at least in the near future.
And before I gave in a year in Ukraine for 40-50 concerts.
They met as nowhere.
A very grateful public.
And with several Ukrainian artists cooperated: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, a lot of gifted people, and sincerely sorry that now they can not fully spill their talent on a wide Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be happy to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example Slava Vakarchuk, and made a joint concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at the moment...
Andrei Okhlopkov was moved from the cosmodrome
As it became known, the technical director of the cosmodrome East Andrey Okhlopkov began work at the State Space Research and Production Center (SCPC) named after Khrunichev.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny Cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the leadership of the Ground and Space Infrastructure Operation Center (CENCI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Fili, where it will coordinate production.
The successor of Mr. Okhlopkov will not be: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functionality is dispersed by the units of the CENCI.
The technical director of the Eastern and Deputy Director General of the Central Communications Service for Technological Development Andrei Okhlopkov told the top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working in the new post for several weeks," the interlocutors of "I" in the industry said.
It was not possible to get an operational comment on CENCI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself for comments was not available.
However, the information "K" was officially confirmed in the GKSPC.
He decided to move to the position of Director for Production Coordination, - said the company. - Andrey Okhlopkov set for him the task to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostochny Cosmodrome has fully fulfilled.
Mr. Okhlopkov moved to work in the CENCI in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - on the "northern" cosmodrome served as the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his submission regional businessmen received state orders for resignation, but did not fulfill the obligations to clean the separated parts of launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The responsibilities for technological development related to it in the CENCA were extended to various projects, but the main of them was the construction of the cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, who then headed the Federal Space Agency, said in an interview with Kommersant that the situation in the East "was critical in October 2013."
The fact is that the planning made a strategic mistake: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned at the same time - the end of 2015.
To launch before the end of the year, the construction was decided to be completed six months earlier and the terms were moved from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process had to go into cunning: the specialists of the CENCI began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment at unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and still the transfer (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source "K" at the cosmodrome: "Moreover, we would not have carried out a single launch from the East, but would be engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who supervises the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his "cosmic Susanin," but it was he who almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction site.
Mr. Okhlopkov also remembered the directness: for example, in an interview with "K" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only performer in the Eastern and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of Special Construction?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the duties of the general contractor to complete the construction and installation works at the start and technical complex planned in the fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to a new place of work was disagreements with the management of the Central Communications Service regarding the ways of completion of construction structures and cosmodrome complexes, as well as methods of work with subcontractors.
"It has been decided that this will be the best for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
The employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will be difficult to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to Kommersant, this will not be necessary: the position of the technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be disposed of by the CENKI units.
A program of two specialties will appear in music schools
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the deputy director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this it is possible to re-read students repeat the disciplines, and the question of paying for other classes in the second specialty to solve with the help of special grants, "RIA Novosti" reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to control, and we together with the expert community will develop a mechanism that will allow to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," - said Golubenko.
Last Friday, during the "Ned-Children's conversation" Vladimir Putin with students of the "Sirius" children's center, the student Maria Andreeva said that she had to pay repetitive items in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she studied in the class of violin and piano and has awards of competitions in both directions.
The Head of State recognized her issue very urgent and promised to help.
In Mexico, detained on the wall 17-year-old Russian
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in Mexico City.
The young man with the help of two unknown men climbed through a three-meter fence to the territory of the office buildings complex of the company Nestle and independently climbed one of its towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
They detained the young man on the roof.
Employees of the Ministry of Public Security lowered it to the ground by helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It is found out whether the young man is legally in the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, the video with a young man climbing to a high-rise has become popular in the Internet.
Users called the young man a "speak-man."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help facilitate the HDC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies talk about the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve symptoms in those who suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This is an incurable disease that suffers from approximately 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colics and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to mitigate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from Washington University have found that the main amino acid of the protein triptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the colon tolerance.
Leading researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the intestines ensure that harmful microbes coming with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of starting an inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and thus harming sensitive tissues.
If the equilibrium is too severely disturbed towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in the intestines appear increasing the tolerance of the cells.
And this bacteria need triptophan - one of the building elements of the protein - to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptophane contained in the nutrition of mice, the more of these immune cells they had."
He assumed that the same will work for people: the combination of L. reuteri and the rich triptophane diet can contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation of the environment in the intestines.
Dr. Louisa Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying the variety of increasing the tolerance of immune cells, found that one group of experimental mice had these cells, and another group, which belonged to the same line, but was kept separately, they were not.
She suggested that the difference can be caused by mice intestinal microbioms - communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the intestine cells of mice was sequenced, and six species of bacteria present in mice, having immune cells, but missing in mice that do not have them, were found.
Mice grown in a sterile environment, which did not have a good microbiom and did not develop this kind of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and their immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of liquid - without bacteria - to the undeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the trimtona refining, known as indol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophanes in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of triptophane was halved, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Cervantes Barragan explains that people have the same increasing cell tolerance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in its gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether triptophanes from L. reuteri contribute to the development of cells in humans as well as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in genes associated with triptophane were found.
She says: "Perhaps the development of these cells we need to strengthen, because the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of triptophane in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to expansion of their population."
According to José Mourinho, "Manchester United" hired the genicia in the face of Nemanja Matic
"Manchester United has hired a genja" in the face of Nemanja Matic, believes José Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, who had acquired 40 million pounds from Chelsea, began with a victory with a score of 2-1 in Dublin in the last pre-season match "Junayed" before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed as a midfielder, while players like Pogba and Andreas Pereira were getting through when they were drawn.
However, since Matic did not participate in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he seriously lacked preparations for the game, and he withstood only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires revision before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius is in how he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to prepare sooner than late."
Just like Matic, his new comrades Victor Lindelef and Romelu Lucac started the game at Aviv Stadium when Mourinho began to form his core composition by the beginning of the next season.
This week, the newspaper "Independent" reported that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but he emphasized that the club had already achieved fantastic results by recruiting three of the four players he would like to hire in the first place.
"I am grateful to the club for getting three of the four," he added.
I will rejoice even more if they reach me four out of four, but they have already done very much for me.
Former leaders of Social Democrats of Lithuania persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former premiers Algirdas Butkevicius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Social Democratic Party, Ceslovas Jurshenas, appealed to the party members to stay in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the "Parlamentskaya Gazeta" newspaper, due to frictions with partners - the Union of peasants and the "green" - a discussion has been initiated in the Social Democratic Party, whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And three senior experienced comrades have appealed to the party with an open letter, in which, in particular, it is said: "It is clear that comrades from the party's results are clear, but the coalition with "peasants" has created for us, albeit not very easy, but still the conditions for further implementation of the goals of social justice, which, on our initiative, are envisaged in the government's program, and to preserve the political domination of the left-wing center over the right party."
According to former party leaders, the discussion so far "has impressed the expression of opinions based on emotions without specific arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that by thoughtless actions their party may lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamaev was fined
The Moscow City Court softened the punishment of a disabled person Anton Mamaev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand. rub.
Earlier, the sentenced person was released from pre-trial detention by the decision of the Timiryazevsky Court.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the defendant was a criminal, since he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a motor-lotler from a former Special Forces fighter.
The Moscow City Court softened the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200,000 by its decision. rub. fine.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility," explained the press secretary of the Moscow City Court Ulyana Solopov.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamayev, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied the article. 64 Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to appoint punishment below the lower limit.
As for Mamayev's assistant Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would be the basis for changing the category of gravity of the offence and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed by the court decision.
The only legal decision would be justification, intends to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out the appeal of the sentence in the cassation instance of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in the criminal case last autumn.
Disabled claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160 thousand. rub. to then sell.
However, the owners of the motor-lotler, among whom - the former Special Forces fighter, said that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov seized their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in a penal colony, and Anton Mamaev sentenced him to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in a penal colony (part). 2 Art. 162 Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in pre-trial detention, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Human Rights Commissioner under the President Tatyana Moskalkova, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamaev was released from pre-trial detention by the same Timiryazevsky court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
UNF to prepare a report on ecology to the President
The final "Forum of Action" of the All-Russian People's Front (UNF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, following the results of the forum "front-line workers" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
The sources of "Izvestia" note in the ONF that the report of the head of state will contain "deep analytics" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to "Izvestia," the final forum of the ONF will be held in autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at the key events of the UNF.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The total will be the conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
Based on the proposals made and expressed at these events, we will form systemic proposals for solving environmental problems, - said the interlocutor in the ONF to Izvestia.
Olga Timofeeva, co-chairman of the Central Staff of the movement, head of the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the "front-line workers" will inform the head of the state about the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and "Forum of Action" of the ONF are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we dropped a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report, which we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "front-line workers" report on the work on the priority projects of the ONF, - Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, special representative of the Head of State on environmental, ecology and transport Sergei Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
Previously, he had already participated in the work of the UNF Media Forum, which was held in April in St. Petersburg.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and most importantly, what needs to be done today is to launch environmental mechanisms to work for many years.
To prevent these issues from falling out of the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
Andrei Kolyadin, Head of the Laboratory of Regional Policy of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted: raising environmental issues, the UNF operates in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts on various forums, and these initiatives were supported by the president, - Andrei Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that today it is impossible to exclude the economic potential of the environmental agenda, which can give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the UNF regions will be able to lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, - the expert added.
The relevance of the environmental issues was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (already developed a bill on banning open coal transhipment in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is a further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
It is necessary to implement the decisions made by the state, - says Leonid Bochin, head of the charity fund "Ecology for All."
Sergei Tsyplenkov, head of the Greenpeace Rossii non-governmental organization, emphasized that there is little responsible approach of society and business to successfully solve environmental problems, there is little need for a significant solution of environmental problems.
As soon as the society and business realize that the solution to environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to change the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically advantageous solution for business.
British inventor implanted himself a microchip to get into the house and a car in a swipe of his hand
The British inventor was the first person in the country to install a microchip, so that he could open the door of his house, go to the office and even start the car with a simple swing of his hand.
The thirty-trich-year-old Stephen Northham implanted a tiny chip between the thumb and the index fingers and now, through his company, "BioTeek" offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives by means of technology.
He joined together with Dr. Jeff Watson, anesthesiologist-consultant from the Royal in Winchester, taking care of the implantation procedure to be carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northham also replaces the locks in houses and machines with a chip-compatible price of 300 pounds per lock.
The married father of one child has already established the technology in his house and in his car, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House's requisite has cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided to the journal, the White House's decision last month to bring the helicopter of the marines to the South Lawn for the event dedicated to the American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as 24,000 dollars.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One, when the president is on board, became the central element of the event held on July 17 in the White House, which was demonstrated by American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens and the top officials of the White House inspected technological products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was exhibited near the yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Helicopter Squadron of Marines (HMX-1), the Helicopter Division, the White House Military Administration ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an unusual event.
"I just wanted you to make sure that you are aware of, because it is an unusual widely covered event in the press," wrote the commander of HMX-1 in an e-mail to his chief, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 am on July 17 to participate in the event scheduled for 3 o'clock in the day, and will remain there before the lawn is released between 6 and 9 pm on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the restrictions on the hours of work.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the security staff of the unit remained near the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was unclear from the records received by the journal that it was not clear whether the second crew was required in the end.
The Hatch law prohibits federal officials from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 specified whether the event is not contrary to this decision.
"At other hand, we asked if this is a violation of the Hatch law, and we were told that no," the commander wrote.
"It seems that you have nowhere to go," answered the deputy chief.
The event "Made in America" was announced by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch law was not applied to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made an effort to promote the health reform, which was then in the development of the Senate, and praised the attempts to regulate government decisions.
The use of aircraft known as the Marine One and the Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are instructed to use them for travel.
But it is unusual to request them only in the interests of photo-possibilities.
Trump has already become a subject of discussion in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first electoral rally in Melbourne, in the state of Florida, and his Twitter account is blocked with reports of complaints about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor.
"The White House is delighted with the show "Made in America," which presented products from 50 states, made by American workers from American materials," said Deputy Press Secretary of the White House Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and the South Lawn to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with an accuracy of inches.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight, carried out for the event "Made in America," was counted on the crew at the expense of the necessary training flights in a month.
The helicopters of the unit also flew 11 additional hours on that day within the framework of the "Ne-presidential tasks for the provision of support."
According to the White House, taxpayers did not have the costs for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
The representative of the company "Sikorsky" said that the company did not take part in the organization of a demonstration of a helicopter in the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the hourly rates of the Ministry of Defense for 2017 fiscal year, the rate of compensation of the Ministry of Defense for VH-3D is 24,380 USD per hour of flight.
The department recorded that the airtime was 30 minutes each side of its airborne base on the Kuantiko aviation base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
"To calculate the value for taxpayers, based on the approximate rate of compensation, is completely wrong," says Walters.
"These exemplary rates include the personnel, service and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual appropriations.
According to a study conducted in 2015 by the corporation RES, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of the personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, service and costs specified in the contract.
At that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Speyser, spoke in defense of the use of a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to demonstrate this week the things done in America," said Speyser.
I know that the company "Sikorsky" and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose workplace depends on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the creation of which so many Americans worked tirelessly.
Therefore, of course, it is absolutely appropriate to pay attention to this.
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with a helicopter, inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he definitely sat on a driver's seat in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed the representatives of the company "Sikorsky" joked with the press on the topic of his own fleet of products of the company.
"I know very well about Sikorsky," said the president. I have three of them.
Moscow to allocate grants for resuscitation offices of city hospitals
Annually, grants "Save Life" will be allocated to resuscitation and intensive care departments of the capital's medical clinics.
Funds will be directed to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin visited the Yudina City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he presented a letter of gratitude to the doctor-terrorist-orthopaedist Victor Protsko, under whose leadership the most difficult operation was carried out to reconstruct the foot of the teenager.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants to intensive care and intensive care departments of city clinics annually.
The funds will be directed to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the capital mayor, the Yudina Clinical Hospital is currently one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at Kolomna Rural Hospital.
Currently, the medical departments are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospital, there are full-time departments.
The staff of the hospital has 2,800 people.
The total area, occupying the medical clinic, is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant of a pilot project for the organization of hospitals for short-term stay (SKP).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, allowing to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
After surgery in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
Only in the first half of this year, 36,000 patients were provided with inpatient hospital named after Yudina.
Medical staff of the clinic performed 15800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbank
In the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbank.
This is on Friday, August 4, reports TASS with reference to a representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Victor Prokomeni to agree on the indirect (through Paritytbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank's shares has been withdrawn.
"Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBU were not received," the message reads.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Victor Prokopenya withdrew the application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused Russian businessmen Said Guceriev and Grigory Guselnikov to purchase the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator substantiated its decision by the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification for their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian subsidiary Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The major shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev.
The sanctions against "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which was Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are forbidden to withdraw capital from the country in favor of parental organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can be representative only when all members of the society, including women, participate in them, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
According to Nicolas Haysom, the current head of the UN mission to promote Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for elections to councils of provinces, three women are fighting for the post of vice-president, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only when women participate in them fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections for the councils of provinces and presidential elections will take place in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban Movement threatens to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's elections, the authorities for the first time move peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Hays said that raising the role of women will contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the total number of 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The Prosecutor General's Office of Russia approved the indictment in a criminal case against former governor of the Kirov region Nikita Belykh, charged with obtaining a large bribery.
This was reported on Thursday, August 3, in the department, reports RIA Novosti.
The materials were submitted to the Presnensky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened penalties for swimming in channels from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walks around the city in a swimsuit or with a nude torso will now be fined 200 euros.
For 100 euros will be required from those who arrange a picnic in a public place or ride a bike in pedestrian areas, reports TASS with reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for inscriptions on monuments of 400 euros and for garbage 25 euros.
Inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of a special company "Address, respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) in social networks, as well as through ads and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the largest crowd of tourists.
The campaign will be held in 10 languages.
According to the tourism advisor of Venice Paola Mar, the information about the fines will be transmitted to the embassies of native countries of violators, so as to warn their compatriots from such mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach," she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
In Venice, there is already a successful restriction on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people who want to watch the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were admitted to the place of action.
In addition, a moratorium on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice has been introduced.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electric energy consumers, which have been fulfilled for decades, are beginning to produce fruit.
From September 1, the cost of electricity in low voltage for industrial recipients is reduced by 25%.
Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the wholesale market of electric energy and power and in the summary forecast balance of production and supply of electric energy (power) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia by subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017. No 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electric energy for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republic have offended the thresholds of Moscow offices in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric power plants in Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main watershed area for which Buryatia is.
And only this year began the moves.
In March, the tariffs for electric energy for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of the territories of the wholesale market price zones, for which the peculiarities of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established is the turn of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays for kilowatts/hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date of the new tariff moves towards a downgrade for Buryatia.

Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is large in the local society and in the territory of the Great Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the background of Brexit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and chronic decline in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at the McVitie's factory.

We are fully aware of the value of Tolkros as a production facility, and in case of any changes in the work on this facility, the employees and representatives of the trade union will learn about it first.
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet should join the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHK), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to assist in resolving the contradictions that have arisen.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that the relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for the VHC jeopardizes the implementation of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from Rosneft's perimeter, but we do not have such resources," Sechin added.

In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on this issue continue, and "there are no sharp corners there."
Did I warn you to "PSG" "Barcelona" about the transition of Neymar three years ago?
Member of the League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
"Pari Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his redemption, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record of the attack that took place three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window, when the club Ligue 1 was ready to beat the world record at the cost of transition, more than twice the previous mark associated with the return of the Pole Pogba in "Manchester United" last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is over, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG' offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds per week clean.

But was not the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of "PSG"?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a tough warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they are touched by one of our players, then we will oppose them, we will make suggestions to their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will be impressed by the consequences.
Apparently, "Barcelona" crossed this line, when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the midfielder from "PSG" Marco Verratti.
"PSG" made it clear that he will not let the Italian player go on any terms, and now, probably, "Barcelona" feels the consequences of his offer in the form of losing one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
