28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim&#39;s brother says that he cannot imagine someone who would want to hurt him, noting: &quot;Finally, things were going well for him.&quot;
“The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia,” the San Francisco Forensic Bureau said.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death has been classified as homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim&#39;s brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC&#39;s KGO in San Francisco that Frank, a former serving line chef in Boston, got his dream job as a cook at San Francisco&#39;s Sons &amp; Daughters six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons &amp; Daughters said they were &quot;shocked and depressed&quot; by his death.
“We are a small team that works like a close-knit family and will be sorely missed,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank&#39;s family and friends during this difficult period.
Luis Galicia said that Frank had stayed in hostels at first, but recently &quot;Finally, things were going well for him.&quot;
&quot;He found an apartment, he dated a girl,&quot; Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone who would be willing to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with his family has always been to cook some dish for us, cook us dinner, &quot;said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
“For all the bad things that happen to this world, it was that rough diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.

Italy&#39;s public debt rises to record highs
The size of the national debt of Italy in June 2016 exceeded 2.248 trillion euros.
The central bank of the country said that this amount is a historical maximum, RIA Novosti reports.
The previous negative record was set in May this year.
Then the size of the national debt reached 2.228 trillion euros.
It is noted that in the first half of the year, Italy&#39;s debt burden increased by 77.2 billion euros.
Earlier it was reported that at the end of 2015, Italy&#39;s public debt amounted to 132.7% of the country&#39;s GDP.
Meanwhile, the Italian Minister of Economy and Finance Pierre Carlo Padoan predicted a decrease in this indicator in 2016 to 130.9%, and in 2018 to 123.4% of GDP.
141 victims of the terrorist attack in Domodedovo received payments from the airport.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviation Fund, which was created by the management of the Domodedovo airport to help victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, Interfax reports.
According to the press secretary of the airport, Alexander Vlasov, two more applications are currently under consideration.
&quot;The fund continues to make charitable payments to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and provides comprehensive assistance to resolve existing issues,&quot; Vlasov added, recalling that the fund&#39;s website was created specifically to facilitate interaction with the victims, containing full information on the procedure for providing charitable assistance.
In 2011, in the arrival hall of foreign airlines Domodedovo, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 37 people were killed, and another 172 were injured.
Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
An international group of biologists has come to the conclusion that the longest-living vertebrate animal is the Greenlandic polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, reports RT.
Scientists have carried out radiocarbon analysis of the lens of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five meters in length, can be from 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays an important role in shark longevity.
Female harp sharks only reach sexual maturity by the age of 150.
Earlier it was believed that the shark&#39;s &quot;neighbor&quot;, the bowhead whale, lives the longest of all vertebrates.
The oldest specimen known to scientists was just over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin by his decree made changes to the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, the Kremlin press service reported.
Earlier it became known that Putin dismissed the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, and Anton Vaino was appointed his successor.
Ivanov will now work as the president&#39;s special envoy for environmental protection, ecology and transport.
The deputy secretary of the Council, Rashid Nurgaliyev, was expelled from the permanent members of the RF Security Council.
The council includes Sergei Ivanov, Anton Vaino, the presidential envoy to the Siberian Federal District, Sergei Menyailo, and the envoy to the Northwestern Federal District, Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov has been relieved of his post as head of the presidential administration.
By presidential decree, Sergei Ivanov was relieved of his post as head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov was appointed special representative of the Russian Federation for environmental protection, ecology and transport.
Anton Vaino, who previously held the post of Sergei Ivanov&#39;s deputy, has been appointed the new head of the administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to be transferred to another job.
Is it worth going to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the head physician of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
We need a spa vacation not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the state of his body and receive doctor&#39;s recommendations on how to live so that his health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
“I’m just tired of work” is an important signal from the body and should not be dismissed.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And stress is experienced by about 90% of visitors.
Moreover, people from large cities aged 45 to 55 are most susceptible to it.
So it&#39;s best not to complicate the situation and give yourself a break in time.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable stay for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend a vacation with children, you do not have to part with them.
Wellness programs are provided for children, even the smallest ones, which include both diagnostic services, pediatrician consultations, analyzes, and medical ones.
For example, swimming (in many resorts there are children&#39;s pools), inhalation, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physiotherapy exercises.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor, taking into account individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in the sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children&#39;s club with animators, where children can attend game lessons, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums even open their doors to guests with babies, provide babies with the necessary conditions and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
Mild winters, long summers, an abundance of sunny days a year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round recreation at the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest, not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most of the procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season in any way.
In general, spa treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main feature of the Caucasian Mineral Waters region is, of course, the medicinal mineral springs: Slavyanovskiy, Smirnovskiy, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various body systems.
Water differs in temperature, amount of salt, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient&#39;s well-being.
So, &quot;Narzan&quot; has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effects, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
&quot;Essentuki-4&quot; affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers sugar levels.
&quot;Essentuki new&quot; has anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effects.
Slavyanovskaya water has the same effects.
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, he selects less salty water, because salts retain fluid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
Reception of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now in the sanatoriums, various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are also available.
What types of health improvement, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is the Tambukan salt lake, the silt mud from which is useful for joints, spine, and internal organs.
It has anti-inflammatory, resorption, immunomodulatory effects.
These are wellness walks along individually tailored routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Kurortny Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the Narzan mineral spring.
There you can also take wine, pearl, iodine-bromine, selenium, sage-licorice baths, depending on what your doctor prescribes.
We will extend fruiting.
What can be done to keep the harvest until the end of the season?
By Yulia Belopukhova, agronomist and summer resident.
It&#39;s time for tall tomatoes to get a haircut: remove new stepchildren, cut off the tops, remove all leaves until the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small ovaries - they will not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of their &quot;constitution&quot;, as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with ash-superphosphate extract, treated with biological products (Dosrevatel - to accelerate the filling and growth of fruits, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Bactofit - from diseases, Immunocytofit - to increase immunity, Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocid, Fitoverm - if there are pests).
Of the chemicals at the end of summer, it is worth using only copper sulfate, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We do the last watering of the plants.
We lower the long-leaved cucumbers in the greenhouse from the trellis so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, pour it with warm water and Zircon solution, sprinkle the stem with 5-7 cm of compost.
Prolonging the fruiting of zucchini is also easy: cut off the old leaves, spill it with warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, add fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against the cold at night, install arcs with covering material over the bed.
Keep the plants open during the day and close them after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia&#39;s emerging from its longest recession in twenty years.
According to analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, Russia&#39;s GDP is showing positive dynamics - in the second quarter, GDP fell by 0.8% on an annualized basis.
This figure is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed down to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently announced the stabilization of the situation.
Slow growth ahead.
According to CBR experts, the recession in the Russian economy is a thing of the past.
&quot;The index estimate of the Russian GDP suggests that the recession is over, and ahead is the slow growth of the economy,&quot; the Bank of Russia&#39;s bulletin &quot;What Trends Talk About&quot; says.
The regulator&#39;s specialists increased the modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to a representative of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, during the second quarter, the decline in the RF GDP stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted GDP decline was 0.2% qoq.
But during the quarter the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June the change in GDP was within the range of 0-0.15, &quot;RIA Novosti quotes a representative of the Ministry of Economic Development.
The slowdown in the decline of the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that the bottom has been passed.
Among other markers that indicate signs of a revival in the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth in demand for electricity and rail transport, the revival of business.
If we make an allowance for the fact that the year is a leap year, then it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to the additional working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality, &quot;explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lowering price pressures.
In July, the CPI stood at 7.2%, up from 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks Rosstat has been recording deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has strengthened by 12% in August since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy &quot;, - emphasizes Yakovenko.
In addition, an increase in industrial production has been observed in the Russian Federation since April.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing down from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The situation on the labor market also demonstrates positive dynamics, where the unemployment rate dropped to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the favorable situation on the labor market, the issue with the real disposable income of the population leaves much to be desired.
In annual terms, the indicator is down 4.8%.
This factor can impede economic recovery, as household spending makes a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the tough policy of the Bank of Russia can also be named as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
An insufficiently high level of investment is also a negative factor, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the rate of decline in the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015, &quot;says Irina Rogova, an analyst at Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-established in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, is not yet so actively developed in summer sports.
If former foreigners compete in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia, then in most cases we are talking about natives of countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the opposite process - a fairly large number of Russians are flying the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some were taken to another country by their parents in childhood, leaving no choice.
Someone could not stand the competition for a place in the Russian team.
And someone thought that the best conditions for development in sports would be created abroad.
AiF.ru has found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says that her name is Lisa Ryzhikh.
But earlier she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa&#39;s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to take up athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose pole vaulting.
If she had stayed in Russia, she would hardly have been able to &quot;move from the throne&quot; Elena Isinbaeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be the only our countrywoman, albeit a former one, in the pole vault sector.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
Elena Pirozhkova, 29, was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelical propagandists.
Largely because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children grew up in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to get involved in wrestling at school.
Showing good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her studies at the US Wrestling Training Center under the guidance of another former Russian, Vladislav Izboinikov.
At the 2012 London Olympics, Elena lost her first fight.
But at the World Championships in the same year - a victory.
Before that, by the way, she managed to win silver at the 2010 world championship.
After that, there were bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first got acquainted with synchronized swimming.
But it would be wrong to say that she was brought up by our coaches in Russia.
Soon the girl&#39;s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
Soon she was already part of the US national team and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level it cannot compete with Russian synchronized swimmers, but for America its indicators are the ceiling.
Kristina Shaldybina received a new name, which sounds strange in Russian, at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue training the girl in rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Until this moment, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
Of course, she did not have to fight for the first positions on the world stage, but for the USA she organized a real breakthrough - she brought the Stars and Stripes team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another former &quot;artist&quot; of ours is Yana Berezko-Margrander, who plays for the German national team.
Yana was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects of getting into the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
There, however, Yana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the final competitions in the individual championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Youth Games.
Another gymnast, only this time athletic - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the athletes mentioned earlier can be called standard, then the choice of Irina&#39;s family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of the Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
True, Ira still trains in Russia - she comes to her homeland on purpose so as not to lose her skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in individual all-around.
There is very little information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has been living and training in Switzerland.
However, for a long time, she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a country&#39;s record at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to compete under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th in the 4 × 100 complex relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for the preparation for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, the champion of Russia, and the master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped making his way to our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from the sports platforms.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
Even less is known at home about another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Mikhail began to engage in artistic gymnastics.
He did not achieve great success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th in the parallel bars qualification.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in artistic gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Nastya, who was born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming lessons, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
In the solo program, she was fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kreuter plays for the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to immigrate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry already became the champion of the country.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Kreuter also won gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry is engaged in long jump and triple jump.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Khasavyurt, who, after long performances for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sports Excellence in Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 he even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow into the family of the USSR national volleyball team player Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to pursue a career in Italy.
The family stayed there permanently.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze medalist of the European Championship, held on the territory of his new homeland.
Khadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and ended up with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - I had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to study freestyle wrestling.
He soon won the junior world championship and later qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again freestyle wrestling, and again a former Russian.
This time we will talk about a native of North Ossetia who emigrated to Spain - about Taimuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was awarded Spanish citizenship and currently plays for the national team of that country.
Prior to that, however, the 30-year-old athlete had already achieved high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
Tired of missing the national team, Taimuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Makhachkala - Artur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began boxing.
Since then, Arthur has become the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion among youth.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the Pan American Games gold, the first for his new homeland since 1975.
Head of the Presidential Administration of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
On Friday, August 12, Vladimir Putin appointed Anton Vaino as head of the Russian presidential administration.
Previously, this position was held by Sergei Ivanov.

Why do children need Cossack classes in schools?
According to the governor V. Kondratyev, &quot;the Cossacks should be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically.&quot;
They must grow and at least 7 years old understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But so far this work, it seems to me, is being carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes take in all the positive that has been accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If everything is in a hurry and no one knows how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and communal services continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country&#39;s economy.
There are encroachments on funds allocated for the needs of the communal sector from the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General&#39;s Office, inflated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing sector.
As a result, the consumers of the region overpaid the power engineering specialists over 170 million rubles.
Recently, the prosecutor&#39;s office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of including unreasonable costs in the tariffs.
And the expenses of IV-Consulting LLC (supplies cold water) included 4 million rubles. for car rental at a price higher than the market price.
And there are a lot of such examples across the country.
The people give the last money for the &quot;communal&quot;, and they pay regularly - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate from the population is 94%.
He is charged with several articles of the Criminal Code at once: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds from crime, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of city facilities, Makarov entered into contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually carried out, but was paid.
The businessmen simply returned most of the money to him.
And as the owner of the Criminal Code, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay the service providers and spent it on his own needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents - millions of rubles.
The scheme of Makarov&#39;s machinations, alas, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the heads of the Criminal Code, who embezzled citizens&#39; money, swept across the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kokhan, by the way, also a former deputy of the City Council, who is accused of fraud worth 91.7 million rubles, continues.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013. in Elizovo Kamchatka Territory, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the management company, the other two played the role of cash settlement centers, that is, they accepted money from the population.
However, A. Kokhan did not transfer funds to power engineers, but spent on himself, his beloved.
It is quite difficult to sue in the housing and utilities sector.
Cases are not initiated, they are dragged on.
And the extremely confusing housing legislation &quot;helps&quot; in this, - says Svetlana Razorotneva, executive director of the NP &quot;Housing and Communal Services Control&quot;.
We do not have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one, which should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including among judges, on housing and utilities issues.
The lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in universities.
The Prosecutor General&#39;s Office also speaks about refusals to initiate criminal cases, about red tape in the course of investigations.
Of the 3,500 crimes in production in 2015, less than half were sent to court.
For the rest, the investigation became protracted, and every fifth was suspended due to the failure to identify the accused person.
Often, shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the bodies of inquiry are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
For 5 months of this year, their number has increased only slightly - 99.
And what is falsification of the minutes of the meeting of tenants?
This means: a change in the management of the house, financial and other issues bypass the opinions of the owners.
It also means that normal companies that want to work honestly and not &quot;milk&quot; the population cannot break through to the market of housing and communal services.
It turns out that tenants are in the red, small and medium-sized businesses too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in the entire state, - said Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Issues.
And now this work is being actively carried out.
These are not just isolated actions - they are a targeted course towards the fight against corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital does not smell of scandals.
Why are there no such scandals in the housing sector in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital&#39;s government showed an iron will and put things in order, - Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, told AiF.
I mean the personnel issue, and legislative amendments, and legal education.
The management companies are closely monitored, and all of them have gone through licensing.
Citizens &#39;complaints are promptly resolved in the public space (both residents&#39; appeals and response measures are posted on the portal of the Moscow government).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but closely follow what is written there, how the house is maintained.
The awareness among the population about the rights of owners and the obligations of resource supplying and managing organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is checking the validity of tariffs for housing and communal services - after all, a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably, all this together explains the calm atmosphere in Moscow.
It turns out that everything rests on the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the weak-willed should change their place of work?
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan issued an ultimatum to the United States, offering to choose between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d&#39;état.
He stated this, speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on the Americans to refuse to support the &quot;Fethullah terrorist organization.&quot;
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the US calls for a change in its position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey&#39;s relations with the West is growing more and more and may lead to a new attempt to change the government in the country.
&quot;Sooner or later America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO (&quot; Fethullahist Terrorist Organization &quot;).
Either FETO organizing coups, or democratic Turkey.
She has to make this choice, &quot;the Anatolian news agency quoted Erdogan&#39;s appeal, made on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The Turkish President once again, but already more severely, demanded that the United States fulfill his demand, which he voiced for the first time immediately after the suppression of the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdogan made an appeal to the population, the riot was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people fell under suspicion, in whose ranks, in addition to the military, there were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania, USA.
Erdogan&#39;s supporters also admitted that the Americans could be directly involved in the coup.
The United States denied all claims against it, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising him to change his tone.
The last statement of representatives of the State Department on this score was made at the time of Erdogan&#39;s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the Turkish president - he stubbornly insists on his own and also puts forward demands on his other Western partners.
&quot;Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not announce a date for lifting visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,&quot; Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Celik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara&#39;s introduction of amendments to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, will endanger Europe&#39;s own security.
Note that on August 1, Vice Chancellor of Germany Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open borders for migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to the corresponding statement by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Cavusoglu made another provocative statement last Wednesday, admitting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country will consider the possibility of leaving the alliance if it does not meet the expected support from him.
The decision to increase defense cooperation with Russia is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defense sphere - they import missiles, &quot;Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
&quot;Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member states, but the results did not satisfy us, and we began to look for others,&quot; the minister said.
Experts believe that all this speaks of serious disagreements between Turkey and the West and the country&#39;s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise Yevgeny Minchenko believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of ties to the West, both from a business and military point of view (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance while maintaining framework relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for the Americans to see a completely obedient person in this post, &quot;the expert explained to AiF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about non-payment of compensations to the EU, about the requirement of a visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States), pressure will be put on him.
&quot;Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country, and so on,&quot; Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information Aleksey Mukhin admits that the Turkish president will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes beneficial to him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance towards Russia and by all means sought favor in the West.
In a very short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There are no guarantees that after some time the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think that Erdogan has entered the period of shuttle diplomacy.
Finding himself between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself, &quot;Mukhin said.
In his opinion, the main task for the Turkish president today is to retain political power in the country, and for this he just needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin so that the United States stops supporting Gulen.
Turkey is needed by both the EU and the United States, which use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached, &quot;the expert said.
Anna Glazova, head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East, adheres to a different point of view.
Now Turkey&#39;s relations with both the EU and the United States are quite tense, and this is primarily due to the domestic policy pursued by Erdogan personally.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset the policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, there is active political interaction with Iran, &quot;Glazova explained to AiF.ru, admitting that Erdogan&#39;s next step will be to normalize relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is currently pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept, which was followed by Turkey before the start of the Arab revolutions.
“It was then, on the position of“ zero problems with neighbors, ”Turkey began to very actively develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
Now the Turkish President has had very successful visits to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey&#39;s positions both in the regional and international arena, &quot;the expert said.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relations with the EU, now the question is rather whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can open its borders to migrants and thereby create serious problems for Europe.
Associate Physicians&#39; Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of junior doctors have asked the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new contract.
The JDC of the British Medical Association (BMA) is set to ask its full council to support more collective protests from early September.
JDC says ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the employment contract negotiated with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in a secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairman Helen McCourt said the government remained &quot;stubbornly silent&quot; about the issues she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said, &quot;Given the current environment, the JDC executive voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all of your issues.&quot;
In response to government silence, the JDC chief today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to endorse an ongoing program of expanding collective protests starting in early September.
The controversy has led young doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The BMA Associate Physician Leader, Dr. Joan Malawana, resigned after voting to abolish the agreed terms of employment that the BMA had recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good deal to be taken at meetings ahead of a vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be used for healthcare professionals in England.
Russia and Turkey: &quot;Alliance of the Bad&quot;?
It was the gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I got the strong impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin&#39;s smile looked strained, and he barely radiated warmth, even by his own low-key standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in contrast, has spoken about his &quot;dear friend&quot; Mr Putin on several occasions - five times, according to one report.
I have lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia will return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr Erdogan&#39;s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm suggested the opposite.
But the lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow&#39;s reaction at this moment was frantic.
Mr Putin erupted in an angry tirade, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger coming from the alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media have carried out a stunning, all-out assault on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan&#39;s own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil from the zones of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied this emphatically.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim a victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from office last month in a coup attempt.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights finally resume.
They put on the peak of the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
&quot;Tourists go there, tomatoes back here,&quot; as it was said in a report in the newspaper Vedomosti.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to that her lingering discontent with the snail-paced pace of talks about joining the EU and Mr Putin&#39;s move - seeking to take advantage of the coolness and gradually disrupt Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support from elected authorities following a coup attempt.
Mind you, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit in this glittering seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an &quot;alliance of the bad&quot;: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
Yet despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on the topic.
The Turkish President deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter - it&#39;s best that the two leaders at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside of Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank&#39;s chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank&#39;s global ambitions.
The bank has fallen away from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer lending brands.
He has been backed by millions of pounds in sponsorship for international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external headquarters and the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller retail banking brands that will gain more influence - Coutts, Adam &amp; Co, Drummond, and Holt&#39;s Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan was interviewed during a customer and employee tour in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: &quot;The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and our staff because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.&quot;
As the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their populations, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.
RBS has already announced that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is ramping up the profile of various brands in sponsoring sports.
&quot;This is the right time for us to move the bank of brands, since basically (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for our customers?&quot; said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great customer bank and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we&#39;ve done focusing on the needs of the clients rather than our own, I think you are seeing a lot of change.
We can bring these brands back again, so I think the time is right.
Franky Dettori goes to 3,000 winners with Newmarket win on Addiction
Dettori sprays champagne after a Newmarket take leads him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this preeminent mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track - Addiction, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this outstanding mark in smooth racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won the Ghayyar, said, &quot;This is something special.&quot;
I&#39;m very excited because my family is here too.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarket, since this is where I settled 30 years ago.
This is not a big social event, this is not Royal Ascot - this is a typical Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am free from business and very unassuming.
Dettori receives applause when Predisposition leads after winning
Two jockeys have achieved this milestone in steeplechase: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4,300 wins in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Franchi is one of the finest jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark that so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical acumen that sets him apart from others in the weight room.
He is a great racing ambassador and his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Franky a few weeks ago at Epsom he would have led 6,000 winners if he hadn&#39;t been just a weekend jockey and big races!
But seriously, Franky has brought winners in the UK for most of 30 years, which is great to see.
He is an energetic character, which is good for British horse racing, but more than that, he is an incredible jockey.
Franky Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with his signature swift dismount.
From fast-paced finishes to fast-paced dismounts, Franky Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth racing for two decades.
These have been ups and downs.
Many big horse race winners, including his famous &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was suspended for doping.
Three years ago, he first ran into difficulties when he returned from a six-month suspension, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while - Dettori previously said he would like to continue competing until at least 50 years old.
Putin dismisses chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin&#39;s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been named Environment and Transport Representative.
A statement from the Kremlin says that Putin &quot;decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,&quot; but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov&#39;s deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He later served as head of the presidential protocol department and the government apparatus, according to the Kremlin&#39;s website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he told Putin: &quot;Thank you for your trust.&quot;
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your work as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being followed.
Putin told a Russian television channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Are smiles convincing?
This is the move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin&#39;s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin that aired on state television, both men said the chief of staff had resigned of his own free will.
But despite the smiles at the camera, few people here have been convinced - especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows yet.
But the official announcement - that the man once campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to rule Russia&#39;s environmental policy - was met with tremendous skepticism.
In remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin&#39;s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even, one might say, a problematic position, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin&#39;s second term, since a third term for Putin would be contrary to the constitution.
However, the post was taken over by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency just three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson Fired After Fighting Producer
Gibson was involved in a brawl on the set of the Los Angeles show last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences on set and differences of opinion.
I&#39;m sorry this happened, &quot;he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson&#39;s character will be dropped from the show, which is monitoring a team of FBI agents, is expected to arrive at a later date, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred on the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
&quot;I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years,&quot; Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be present in it to the end, but now it will be impossible.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our amazing team, and most importantly, the very best fans the show could only dream of.
The show is slated to return with its twelfth season on September 28th.
Riddle: the fish landed in Banff&#39;s garden
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying fish that had appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bane believes that 75 fish may have been gerbils left behind by a waterspout.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted footage of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the emergence of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The Bridge is now connected to Fife
The £ 1.35bn project is now due for completion by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north span and the Queensferry Crossing Viaduct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four connections between the &quot;fans of the canvas&quot; that are now coming to an end near all three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bridge cables.
The £ 1.35bn project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economics Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses to an engineering art of truly epic proportions in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel are used just to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the closing between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a masterly operation using extremely precise assembly tolerances.
In total, about 79% of the entire pavement is now in place, for the last section of the pavement the concrete pavement is being cast in Rosyte today, which means that the entire pavement is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Director for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first crossing on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this joining represents the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it to the expanding roadway of the North Pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or shore-facing - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very graceful operation.
Large-scale, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised at an angle of about 3%.
Elegant because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny - just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Moelfr Bay Rescue: Three Men &#39;Fortunate to Live&#39;
The three men were &#39;lucky to survive&#39; after being thrown off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 1:20 pm UK Summer Time on Friday after the crew saw the incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety while their ship continued on its own.
“We saw their boat circling around them and assumed the worst,” said Moelfre lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones.
“Fortunately, by the time we got on the water, a strong wind blew him away from them,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man in his 60s was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all lifted aboard a coastal lifeboat and taken to a rescue station.
Jones said: “The three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat&#39;s engine had an emergency release, but somehow it unhooked from the person driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a decent hunt for health and happiness
It&#39;s fascinating to watch the world change.
That teens and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time staring at screens, has been a complaint from many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages in some physical activity.
Screen time was initially limited to TV, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It&#39;s so great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I&#39;m of course referring to the craze that is Pokémon Go, a character-based app originally created for video games in the 1990s (which has since spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other ramifications).
Like many other pop culture phenomena, all of this lost its former relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launching in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overwhelmed the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones go looking for Pokémon that are GPS tracked and, once discovered, can be &#39;photographed&#39; (via a screenshot on your phone) or &#39;caught&#39;.
The younger generation that played the game joined the craze, breaking away from sofas to search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps that the &quot;average&quot; person takes on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game&#39;s launch, the number of people it tracks who did 30-minute exercise daily jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on the passage of the levels.
Many health campaigns urging people to “take 30 minutes,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day,” have not resonated because most health messages are boring and come from people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly lower their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people outside to do what they love.
In this way, the three pillars of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunshine and joy.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, there are boring bores looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might bump into the door.
So what?
A breakthrough has occurred.
After all, even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could track our physical activity in the past, they didn&#39;t give us a reason to practice, as this game does.
The novelty will become boring and use will wane over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthy.

The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the overall title on Thursday, placing a chasm between herself and the rest of the world in a compelling demonstration under Olympic scrutiny.
Her overall score of 62.198 was well away from silver medalist and Final Five teammate Eli Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Biles of the United States performs on the balance beam during the women&#39;s individual absolute rhythmic gymnastics finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win an overall title and fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final overall score was shown and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the past three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with programs so overwhelming in their mixture of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her &quot;the greatest gymnast I ever -or saw. &quot;
One final test awaited in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and others in the field as between her and a load of inflated expectations.
Anything less than heading back to your family&#39;s home in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold medals would be seen as an unreasonable expectation.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Eli Reisman hug after winning gold and silver respectively in the women&#39;s individual overall rhythmic gymnastics finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned her first gold on Tuesday, serving as a beautiful final chord for the farewell party for retiring national team coordinator Martha Karoli.
While Biles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, this is not entirely true.
Part of her floor exercise program - the one that includes her signature pass - is set to Latin American music that would fit right at home on the street just outside of Rio&#39;s Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Burman&#39;s mother during a visit to the gym where Burman was a coach became a force.
She hasn&#39;t lost a single overall title since the summer of 2013 - a streak that should last as long as Biles wants it.
Despite the fact that Mustafina gained a slight advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
The gymnastic beam and the floor exercise - where Biles defends his world title - lie in wait.
She went ahead again with 15.433 on the balance beam and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Reisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final bill - pure formality - and tears appeared around Biles&#39; shiny red, white, and blue eyeliner as the design she had once scribbled down on the scrapbook came true.
Reisman&#39;s performance was a little revenge for what happened four years ago when she tied for third place but lost bronze to Mustafina in a tiebreaker.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that the Americans call &quot;grandmother&quot; was way ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old&#39;s viral tweet from the start of this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case gunned down while listening to music in car
The two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix&#39;s first serial killer in a decade, were sitting in their car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis&#39; daughter, Malia, were gunned down on June 12 when their car was parked in the driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired about eight pistol shots while standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he fled in another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple homicide does not appear to be the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallets or $ 2,900 from one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to check if he was involved in four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others were injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over four months.
“This is happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard told KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and perpetrated by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis&#39; daughter, Malia, died instantly.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report of the shelling that targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the shell casings and removed the bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: &quot;It gets better&quot;
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly - the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was - I cannot do this.
I cannot do this.
I didn&#39;t sign up for this.
Which is actually not true - of course you subscribe to this, &quot;she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested placing him in a specialized medical institution.
&quot;My first answer was, &#39;I didn&#39;t think people were doing that yet,&quot; Piksivto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn&#39;t sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn&#39;t speak.
But he slowly goes through some stages.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund came up with for &quot;please sing to me.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;re teaching him sign language,&quot; Pixivto told CBS News.
But not just ordinary sign language - she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund&#39;s, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It&#39;s too early to tell how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I kept saying what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn&#39;t know.
I haven&#39;t actually asked for a lifetime forecast because I don&#39;t expect anyone to actually tell me.
But Pixivto has some encouraging advice for mothers of babies with birth defects due to Zeke.
It gets better.
You know that everything will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding cause rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rainfall expected to fall over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have flooded and threaten widespread flooding following extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid has already left for the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor&#39;s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for high water transport, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Parish of Tanjipahoa alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood hazard remains in effect until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could flood the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood alert was in effect until Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Aimite River near Day Springs, both in Louisiana, are projected to set a flood record over the weekend.
Forecaster Alec Krautmann said both rivers could have flooded many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said flooding downstream in Assenschen Parish is a threat as these swollen rivers will slowly drain into Lake Morpah.
The Tikfoe River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of flooding in Amyth and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hunsford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hunsford, 62, says the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose quickly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
“We woke up and the water kept pouring in,” Hunsford said.
She reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hunsford that this was the largest influx she had seen in the 48 years she lived here.
Hunsford said that he and all his family members have a disability and is the only one who can swim.
Hunsford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they took refuge on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is &quot;spreading rapidly&quot; as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rainfall from Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding have led to rescue efforts in Tanjipahoa parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
WWL, an affiliate of CBS, reports that the Tanjipahoa councilor spoke about 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
Parish President Robbie Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals trapped in the high water.
Shelters have been opened in the city of Amit and the city of Hammond to accommodate those who have been evacuated.
“They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water starts to recede,” he said.
In the city of Hammond, Tanjipahoa Parish, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
&quot;The last major flood we had was in March,&quot; said city manager Lacey Landrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Emergency Management Officer Rupert Lacy said heavy rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
Several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, he said, but none were registered on Friday.
Keith Towson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
&quot;I&#39;ve seen water in places I&#39;ve never seen it before,&quot; said Towson, &quot;and it still pours on the ground.&quot;
Mahaj Brown, 6, &quot;riddled with bullets&quot; survives after shootout in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shooting at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child&#39;s grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown sustained multiple gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
&quot;He was hit hard, his little body was riddled with bullets,&quot; says his grandmother Delores Melendez Station.
I just can&#39;t believe it.
The boy is hospitalized in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown quarter.
They also shot at three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were reported stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men may have been the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be a shootout between several armed men.
Cases from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons, littered the scene.
It seems like it was definitely a long battle.
There were shell casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, apparently, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the firefight, &quot;- said the station the captain of the Philadelphia police Anthony Ginaldi.
Many houses and cars in this area were also affected.
No arrests have been made and the police are reportedly looking at CCTV cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was hit in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That&#39;s what I call this year&#39;s women&#39;s Olympic gymnastics team and for several reasons.
First, I&#39;ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been this dominant.
And second, three gymnasts play a key role in this team: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren &quot;Laurie&quot; Hernandez, who have already inspired so many girls of color.
The roster of this squad, complemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It has also solidified the black and Latino female presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
It&#39;s powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America cheered with approval.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of the three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected, yet virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman in a row to win gold in the women&#39;s individual overall.
And teammate Eli Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn&#39;t look that way in gymnastics sections across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the &quot;final five&quot; because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Martha Karoli&#39;s final year of coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents who pay tuition fees, equipment, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families ) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get the most from their training, an expensive and long-term commitment for gymnast families.
Aimee Burman, trainer for Simone Biles, and Maggie Honey, trainer for Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and affordable gymnastics training for myriad young girls&#39; communities inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have already provided free, low-cost gymnastics classes located in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youths (mostly blacks and Hispanics) and have nurtured national and international champions.
In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to youth who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has lifelong positive effects on good health, school and work success.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that&#39;s great.
Exercise is so important, especially for girls.
Now is such a wonderful time.
Thank you Simone, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious show of &quot;Feminine Strength&quot; in winning the Olympic Team Gold and for motivating so many girls from all backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors set about calling further strikes after Jeremy Hunt&#39;s offer was rejected
Ministers had hoped to end the change dispute by negotiating an amended deal with British Medical Association leaders, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the treaty, saying the NHS was in no-man&#39;s land and any subsequent delay would be detrimental to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract that includes changes to work activities at night and weekends to improve after-hours services.
Dr. Ellen McCot, chair of the BMA&#39;s Young Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: “Associate doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors. fair. &quot;
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The WMA&#39;s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to take action and sometimes complete silence on the part of the government.
This despite Jeremy Hunt&#39;s promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, inspire the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are unambiguous that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April brought about 13,000 planned surgeries and 100,000 nursing appointments to be deferred, while nurses and counselors were brought in to replace doctors on the picketing line.
The ministers hoped to end the controversy over the changes by negotiating an amended agreement with British Medical Association leaders.
WMA wants better weekend pay for 54,000 junior doctors who will be eligible for the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue striking.
Mortimer said: &quot;Strikes accomplish little or nothing, but put pressure on teams and services already working to the limit, and cause anxiety, physical pain and distress to patients, caregivers and their families.&quot;
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Associate Physicians Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of guardians and corporate communications policies.
Workers hoped for continued positive assistance on other important topics such as staff allocation, training flexibility, additional training for those returning after a career break, tuition fees, mutual recognition of the curriculum, leave and gender pay differentials in medicine. - were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions reached by the WMA in November, February and May.
£ 2 a day drug may lower risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are set to take the drug for £ 2 a day, after authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer time.
The anticoagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrences for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
The NICE Surveillance Service of the UK&#39;s National Health Service has advised giving it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, the NICE Surveillance Service of the UK&#39;s National Health Service has advised giving it to people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack affects approximately 140,000 people in England every year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes result from the buildup of fatty material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaque.
If the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood from reaching the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move along the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca and marketed under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making blood clots less likely.
NICE&#39;s draft guidelines, published today, recommend that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: &quot;While there are effective secondary prevention methods available, about a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences.&quot;
The fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person&#39;s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By pre-recommending ticagrelor, we are delighted to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since there is limited information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - beyond three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend treatment beyond this period.
PC-ownership culture allows vote-tampering in Muslim areas to thrive
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfour Rahman was ousted from office last year due to corruption, prompting government report
A culture of political correctness has led to eye-closure that has resulted in widespread vote-counting in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles has criticized police, election observers and city officials for ignoring evidence of electoral fraud due to &quot;oversensitivity about race and religion.&quot;
The former community secretary, now an anti-corruption king, said the religious intimidation of voters was so intense that police should be allowed to cordon outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He suggests that voters take ID cards to prove who they are when they vote.
For now, voters only need to provide their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on people&#39;s fingers as they turn in their ballots, with the goal of excluding someone from voting twice.
Better protection for whistleblowers must be provided, Sir Eric said.
He calls for more access for the press to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
&quot;This is done not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,&quot; he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that incumbent mayor Luftur Rahman should have been removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman &quot;cynically distorted&quot; the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, &quot;led his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of the Muslim believers to vote for him.&quot;
Up to 300 votes have been questioned or personified when a person votes posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He voiced particular concerns about mail-order scams, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID to prove who you are.
His report said: “There was evidence of pressure being exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, in particular women and youth, to vote at the behest of their elders, especially in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.
&quot;There were concerns that ... government agencies turned a blind eye to this behavior due to the oversensitivity of &#39;political correctness&#39; about ethnicity and religion.&quot;
Cheese Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from mailing ballots to stop the &quot;vote harvest.&quot;
The report, pending by Theresa May, also calls for stricter registration checks to prevent the voter roll from being used for immigration and privilege fraud.
An option is being considered to require voters to present their ID before voting.
Use indelible ink on people&#39;s fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on people&#39;s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Remove political campaigners and activists from working with completed absentee ballots and mailing envelopes.
Give police authority to establish cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier for people to charge people with intimidation under the 1983 People&#39;s Act Submission.
Make it illegal to take photographs at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English be used in polling stations (excluding Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to walk into the booth one at a time.
Sir Eric has violently attacked the city police, saying it is &quot;astounding&quot; that no criminal charges have been filed since the Tower Hamlets case.
&quot;The electoral court disqualified Lutfour Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions,&quot; he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt - the criminal standard of proof - on a variety of grounds.
He also criticizes the ineffectual &quot;check-box checks&quot; of electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year&#39;s court order in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert proliferation of electoral fraud and a state of denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Going crazy for the bike counterpart of Kate and other celebrity doppelgangers of the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week went wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevost, who turns out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is far from the only athlete competing for gold this summer to boast of her own famous doppelgänger - at least according to social media posts.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces appearing on our screens to date, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians with more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
Aside from Keith&#39;s bike path lookalike, many people online were quick to point out how a certain archer might be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
US men&#39;s archery team member Brady Ellison caused the hurricane on Twitter after images of him appeared eerily looking like the Star Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, the archer found out about the social media frenzy and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo ever since he was a kid.
&quot;I personally don&#39;t see a huge resemblance, maybe with the exception of facial hair,&quot; Brady told the Huffington Post.
&quot;He&#39;s an attractive guy, so I think that&#39;s a compliment.&quot;
One of the more popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt point to even more this year: the striking similarities between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, is said to be a replica of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg has been compared to Choir star Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is the &quot;athletic version&quot; of the &quot;Inception&quot; actor
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who boast similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova not only boasts the same tanned skin and blonde hair as actress AnnaLynne McCord, while Team USA&#39;s Nathan Adrian looks like &quot;the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt&quot; according to fans.
Stern Women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, right, have the same face and eye shapes.
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others saw similarities as well
Generating Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind this couple&#39;s similar appearance
One Twitter user recently reached out to the site to divulge her delight that &quot;the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.&quot;
In fact, the US soccer star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar face and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold medal-winning gymnast Gabrielle Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful wide smile, which is similar to that of &quot;Bring It On&quot; star Gabrielle Union. ...
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for speaking out about Chinese swimmer &quot;died like a pig&quot;
Byron McDonald&#39;s analysis of fourth-place finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay angered CBC viewers on Wednesday in a live Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer &quot;kicked off like a stench&quot; and &quot;died like a pig&quot; during the swim.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was muted when he began expressing his own opinions at the end of the final women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay.
You could hear MacDonald, who was recruited to the CBC commentator team to &quot;color it,&quot; said, &quot;This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby.&quot;
Too excited, started off like a stench, died like a pig.
Thanks for this.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada&#39;s Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being overwhelmed by the tone and expressions used.
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: &quot;Did the CBC announcer just say that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer &#39;died like a pig&#39; ????&quot;
This idiot didn&#39;t realize they were still on air. &quot;
Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women&#39;s 4x200m freestyle relay was told: &quot;This little 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby.&quot;
Byron MacDonald was immediately attacked by Twitter criticism, with many calling for his firing.
Twitter users couldn&#39;t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: &#39;Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald&#39;s comment, stating, &#39;We apologize for the comment on the swim performance being aired.&#39;
It was a bad choice of words, we&#39;re sorry it happened. &#39;
CBC ended up apologizing to over 90 people who tweeted in response to this comment.
Commentator buddy Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald&#39;s comments
The network also rushed to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to go on the air.
We acted promptly last night to apologize to our live viewers and our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron&#39;s comments referred to the swimmer&#39;s performance, not to her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words would be construed as an assault on a person.
&quot;I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women&#39;s relay,&quot; he said on the CBC broadcast of the Olympic Games.
&quot;I was talking about the swimmer&#39;s performance, not about her personally.&quot;
&#39;It goes without saying that no disrespect was implied, and I&#39;m sorry.&#39;
Primark shopper insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of a store
Shoppers were at a loss for where to look when a woman stripped naked to try on panties on the store floor in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she tried on how she looked in them, pulled them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to search and ended up trying on four pairs of underwear in a bouverie store at Bouverie Place in Folkestone.
A Primark store in Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where a woman tried on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two, who was in the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman &quot;got dressed again and left the store without buying anything.&quot;
She said, &quot;People couldn&#39;t believe what they saw.&quot;
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she grabbed a pair of panties from the window, took off her own tights and panties, and put them on.
&quot;She didn&#39;t try to find a secluded place to do it - she just stood there, shameless.&quot;
&quot;Everyone stared when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn&#39;t like them because she put them back on the shelf.&quot;
She did the same with three other couples before finally deciding that there was nothing here that she liked, dressed again and left.
&quot;She didn&#39;t seem to care who was watching her, or what she thought of the person who would end up buying these underpants she was trying on.&quot;
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: &quot;How disgusting to think that someone is going to take home a pair of underpants that someone else has already worn and they have not been washed.&quot;
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: &quot;I conclude that the staff apparently tried to take these garments from sale after they left - so much the better.&quot;
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to come home with a new pair of women&#39;s panties and find that another woman put them on and off and they weren&#39;t washed.&quot;
A Primark spokesperson said, &quot;Primark is aware of the incident that happened at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday August 9th.&quot;
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Ron Mizrachi, Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York City, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you are approached from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to beat a burglar with his own weapon.
If they come up from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and &quot;clear the line of fire.&quot;
You then squeeze the pistol firmly between your forearm and shoulder before punching them in the face with your free elbow.
This is followed by a knee in the groin, and while the attacker bends over in pain, you unscrew the pistol from his hands, hit him in the face with the barrel and step back, keeping the weapon pointed at him.
For the armed, approaching from the front, the method of execution is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, quickly grab the pistol and twist it so that the villain cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift your weight onto the pistol and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the pistol out of his grip before stepping back and aiming at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery - if you are not a Krav Maga Master - is to hand over your cash.
For a travel guide, the traveler Jan Wright guides his tongue through the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveler put his immune system and gag reflex to the test by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Host and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, ran his tongue over a euro banknote, the Piccadilly Circus railing, a train toilet flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is to become a movie called The Slime Traveler&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength, has produced some amazing results.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train, which is used by thousands of others, can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke with doctors and paramedics about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of the licks brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing the strength of his intestines, traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From the public railings in train stations to the toilet flush button, this task has undoubtedly put his immune system to the test.
In the film he made, he said: &#39;Since childhood, I was completely careless about my health and I pulled a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.&#39;
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test smear showed a luminometer value in excess of 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer reading was over 4,000, while his freshly washed hands showed less than 60
Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio made a film about the traveler called &quot;The Slime Traveler&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength&quot;, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet
In the film, he said, &#39;This is close to one of the worst things I&#39;ve sniffed in the closet.&#39;
There is nothing dirtier than this!
I&#39;m not going to lick anything because it&#39;s disgusting.
The Slime Traveler&#39;s Guide to Inner Strength was filmed with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio Senior Vice President for Appetizers, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: &#39;We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming session that ended with the idea of &quot;let&#39;s call Jan&quot;.
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Rather than just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in a larger context: the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary we were able to present consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: &#39;Let&#39;s just say I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.&#39;
Naturally, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were quite harsh.
I&#39;m glad we managed to film some of those licks. &#39;
In a 2015 poll by Valio, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria exclusively with good stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent said they consume foods containing added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
A family of hooligans destroys Saltash, Cornwall&#39;s council house, on the eve of eviction
A family of bullies left their council house with £ 50,000 losses after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked housing cooperative officials found the property in a state of need for renovation.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the floorboards were ripped open, debris was strewn across the floor, and the walls were covered in graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is expected to live in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a settler at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she would not be saved.
She said: &#39;It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don&#39;t think people should live like this.
There are a lot of things to weigh because this property is likely to be known as a not-so-good aspect of Cornwall.
This family is notorious and their name is notorious.
The couple have three sons who have lived in the property from time to time, and the police report that the realm of family horror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing, excessive screaming, arguments and swearing. ...
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
Old rubbish was found in several rooms of a house that could be demolished
The floorboards in the house that used to sell drugs were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw street fights and called the police regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from their home this week after being given an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily leave.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been made a living hell.
One reported: &#39;They didn&#39;t care about anyone.&#39;
We lived with them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The number of times we&#39;ve seen the police here is incredible.
&quot;We couldn&#39;t sleep this morning.&quot;
We got up because it was so quiet here - we were not used to it!
Now that they&#39;ve finally left, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Housing&#39;s neighborhood team, said the family was unable to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and the police were regularly called
Trash and old toys were strewn below the overgrown side of the council house.
He added: &#39;It is a shame that the tenant could not accept any responsibility for the behavior of her and her family, as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as their behavior was marginal and their actions must have been terrifying for her watching neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and the Devon and Cornwall community have put in bravely to give us information.
I hope this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said that they were all a little over 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to clean up the piles of debris that surrounds the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, along with scales, related accessories and £ 1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She stated that the money went to pay for a tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were covered with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who do not obey the rules for renting premises.
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said this eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel they can behave without blaming the accuser, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Criminal and antisocial behavior will never be tolerated by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to soak up the sun are terribly afraid for their lives
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force said he was on a training flight but insisted there was no security risk
Here is the moment when the frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when the low-flying plane swooped down over the crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying nearly touch-away from hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped to their feet as soon as they became, for obvious reasons, preoccupied with the noise of the aircraft engines, but unable to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the city of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted a video of the shocking flight on social media, said: &quot;It flew very low twice, and there was a moment, at one point it seemed like it would crash.&quot;
Nuno Arrozha added: &quot;I was surfing and I swear it felt like the plane was about to hit me.&quot;
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were terrified when the plane emerged from the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to locate fishing vessels off the coast, and was forced to descend so low as that was the only way to test them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than normal due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, wildfires have damaged the Portuguese mainland and also claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances - thick fog and smog from wildfires, which reduced visibility
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was tasked with locating fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HACCP system has been mandatory for catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are becoming more active, and businesses face fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year now, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - has been mandatory for food manufacturers and carriers, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU) ...
Business inspections by Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials are issuing fines only for certain violations of the regulations (see &quot;List of documents&quot; ...).
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost the enterprise 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HACCP, as a system that takes into account the risks of working with food and prevents them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about the safety of food for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises, not only in the United States, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACCP has been operating on the territory of the Customs Union.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HACCP requirement appeared in the technical regulations of the CU in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production, and not restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is late August - early September.
But they will not cause a rush of demand, since their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday asking them to allow charters now.
&quot;For many Russian tourists, the issue of choosing a high-quality and affordable sea vacation is insoluble, since in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea, most accommodation facilities have already been booked by the end of September,&quot; the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect already established demand for the Russian sea tourism product.
According to the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (PCT), if the aviation departments of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding of when the charters will be resumed yet, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators promptly build programs and agree with airlines on the necessary aircraft on the route, &quot;says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Branch of the PCT.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but it will not greatly affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or are on vacation in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously, &quot;says Pavel Rumyantsev.
&quot;Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget proposals - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who purposefully wait for very cheap tours,&quot; says Valeria Rosenthal, general director of the travel agency Optio -Travel.
Otherwise, you should definitely not count on the excitement - the bulk of the trips have already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but there is no need to expect a rush.
&quot;For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season,&quot; says Pavel Rumyantsev.
&quot;The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season,&quot; Valeria Rubtsova agrees.
The Tax Code provides for exemption from personal income tax of compensation payments established by law within the approved norms related to compensation for harm caused by injury or other damage to health.
The issuance of milk to workers employed in jobs with harmful working conditions in accordance with the established norms is provided for by Art. 222 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the very norms and conditions for issuance are established by order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated February 16, 2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free delivery of milk or other equivalent food products is made to employees on the days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors at the workplace.
Based on these norms, the Federal Tax Service of Russia in the letter under consideration came to the conclusion that on the basis of par. 2 p. 3 art. 217 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation are exempt from personal income tax income in the form of the cost of milk issued to workers on the days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Norms and Conditions approved by order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
Moscow &quot;Gazstroybank&quot; was left without a license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the banking license from the credit institution Joint Stock Commercial Bank GAZSTROYBANK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC JSCB GAZSTROYBANK pursued a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks assumed at the request of the supervisory authority and reliable reflection of the value of the bank&#39;s assets led to the emergence of grounds for the credit institution to take bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in dubious transit transactions.
The bank has appointed a temporary administration for a period of validity until the appointment of a bankruptcy administrator or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit institution have been suspended in accordance with federal laws.
JSC AKB &quot;GAZSTROYBANK&quot; is a member of the deposit insurance system.
Recall that the payment of insurance compensation to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ &quot;On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation&quot; is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance, but not more than 1.4 million rub. in aggregate per one depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the reporting data, by the amount of assets JSC JSCB GAZSTROYBANK, as of August 1, 2016, occupied the 335th place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS dies in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group&#39;s stronghold in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.
The Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
&quot;One can only hope that the only benefit of all this is like a gravestone and a will to others that these are the risks involved in traveling to a war zone - to dissuade people from ever making the same choice,&quot; Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana&#39;s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within months.
Reed states that Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as the Chief Justice nominee if elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland&#39;s approval since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will select the man to replace the last Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reed said in a conference call on Thursday that he predicts that Clinton will pick Garland &quot;with some degree of certainty.&quot;
A spokeswoman for Reed later said that he did not speak to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was just speculating.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn&#39;t want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reed said the Republicans who are blocking Garland&#39;s nomination are &quot;henchmen&quot; and &quot;accomplices&quot; of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for the job.
Treats says erotic calendars are for &#39;women as well as men&#39;
Treats magazine has partnered with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by 1970s Pirelli.
But instead of nude celebrities, they aim to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked muses.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because Playboy is for men.
I make it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar does too.
“We need to go back to showing the timeless and classic nude figure, where women as well as men feel comfortable and inspired by these female body images,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it is a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Muscovites will be given reminders about unscrupulous online stores.
Moscow is going to release a memo that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the department&#39;s specialists are preparing a memo that will help citizens choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure is divided into several sections.
These will be general information and legal framework, rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The appendix will give recommendations on how to properly draw up a claim, and so on, &quot;- said in Rospotrebnadzor.
The memo is currently being finalized.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the Rospotrebnadzor website in Moscow; it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry published a statement in which it named the second suspect in organizing sabotage in Crimea.
Detained persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia, who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts.
Among them are Evgeny Alexandrovich Panov and Andrey Romanovich Zakhtey.
&quot;They all confess,&quot; the message says.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporozhye region Yevgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty during interrogation.
FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency&#39;s website.
&quot;The fine for Google for violating the antimonopoly legislation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future, &quot;said Deputy Head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service Alexei Dotsenko.
During the investigation, the FAS established that Google supplies the manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia with the Google Play application store only on the condition that other applications of the corporation are installed on the device.
Among these applications is the search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Part 1 of Art. 10 of the Federal Law &quot;On Protection of Competition&quot; (abuse of dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the order will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a beneficial effect on our consumers.
The Law &quot;On Protection of Competition&quot; must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, including transnational corporations, &quot;said Elena Zayeva, Head of the Communications and Information Technologies Regulation Department of the FAS Russia.
The agency suspects 16 Russian stores of collusion.
The New Book chain was fined for selling the book 50 Days Before My Suicide.
The Novy Knizhny chain of stores has been fined for selling Stace Kramer&#39;s book 50 Days Before My Suicide, Moscow City News Agency reports.
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as &quot;provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents.&quot;
The Ostankino District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the dissemination of information products among children and ruled to impose a penalty in the form of a fine with confiscation of 49 copies of printed materials arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor department.
A source in Novy Knizhny confirmed that it was Stace Kramer&#39;s work.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow are being tested for the book &quot;50 days before my suicide.&quot;
An evening in memory of Ernst Neizvestny will be held in Moscow.
An evening in memory of the sculptor Ernst Neizvestny will be held in Moscow, TASS reports.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown in the United States in person.
Therefore, it was decided to arrange this evening for those who want to commemorate him in their native land, &quot;said the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
They noted that this is important for the sculptor&#39;s widow Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of Neizvestny are invited to the evening, including the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the artist Boris Messerer, the president of the Pushkin Museum im. Pushkina Irina Antonova, director Mark Rozovsky, as well as Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Moscow Department of Culture Alexander Kibovsky, Deputy Mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier it was reported that the relatives of Ernst Neizvestny plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably before August 14.
The Vinyl End-User: Who Really Buys Records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And until you rush to litter the comments section with rude insults under the pseudonym Not All Alone Middle Aged Men, this statement is based on evidence.
According to YouGov, so much of the talked about record revival is not driven by the millennial boom looking to embrace the novelty of a tangible subject, but by middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
It is also not just an act of collecting by amateurs - it has an emotional meaning: Older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% versus 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov&#39;s results correct?
If this blog was a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of busy Soho Street, wearing a modest gray suit and gesticulating violently before stopping, folding my arms and saying something imposing like, “Okay, let&#39;s see . &quot;
So let&#39;s see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and filth - hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops are now swarming with buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a few record stores with fantastic specialists remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I get close to various people in some of these stores and try to gauge their age and emotional state through observation.
Glasgow native Stewart, 55, followed by me from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20), into London for half a day to hold a meeting and shopping for hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
“I believe so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me a photo, I didn&#39;t chase him home) line the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles stems in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they first came out and buy back items that he sold when he was young and broke.
&quot;A lot of what I buy is the late 60s, early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably too young to buy for.&quot; he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who enjoy their own company, adding, “I don&#39;t smoke, I don&#39;t drink very much.
This is my flaw.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt a responsibility to buy back their old records.
From the conversations I&#39;ve had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records, ”he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
What about the perceived emotional importance of the records?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable company for people with similar views.
Some of the older customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system, Wes said.
Some vinyl lovers may feel overwhelmed by the digital world and prefer to retreat into the permanence of familiar record sleeves, objects that evoke memories of serene youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material things as a kind of tranquility,” says Wes.
Since I am a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it too.
This is an easy way to keep your head busy.
“We are like their social workers!” A colleague spoke from the record rack.
An ICM poll in April found that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album in the last month haven&#39;t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a turntable.
At this point in the news coverage, I would probably look seriously puzzled as I flip through Bossanov&#39;s collection rack.
The &quot;trophy&quot; aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (tally: three middle-aged men) noticed.
&quot;Someone came over recently and said, &#39;I don&#39;t have a turntable, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,&quot; he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely does.
More piece, less music.
We have people who say, &quot;I don&#39;t have a turntable.&quot;
These are younger people, not elderly, they are a little less than twenty, who are just getting to know this.
Fopp, who has now dedicated almost the entire floor to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less laid-back than the aforementioned stores - the latest Wild Beast synth and sexy pop, rather than jazz improvisation, makes its way through the speakers - it&#39;s nice to see the variety in your customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but excruciating psychological trauma is difficult to establish after standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27, walked around Fopp for a few minutes looking at the various records on the market.
She looks at goods, and does not spend money.
She doesn&#39;t make a lot, she says, so making records isn&#39;t a very good option.
It is expensive.
It&#39;s easy to listen to music on a computer or other device, but the beauty of vinyl is ... &quot;, she sinks into dreams with a sigh filled with love.
I don’t know how to explain - it’s really unique.
My last stop is the store that is said to have fostered a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Mods.
While I create the illusion that I am looking at tight-fitting denim shorts, I watch a group of teenage girls gather around a Polaroid camera every minute before a father and his daughter discuss buying a Crosley turntable.
On the left is a staircase lined with records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack: a mix of modern style and classic, must-have records for any medium collection.
No one is looking - perhaps because they are just decoration, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is real &quot;art vinyl&quot;.
But given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few clients to the Soho hinterland for a while, there is little to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the segment of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the segment that spends most of their money on luxury goods such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov&#39;s results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the vast number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world in record stores and online forums.
These people are probably hard at work in school or offices.
But they clearly don&#39;t spend Thursday mornings strolling through record shops on Berwick Street, flipping through records and avoiding the gaze of the nasty 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark - the longest-living vertebrate animal - video report
Scientists claim that the Greenlandic polar shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the record was set by a female between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court rejected a proposal by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearings this week, Calais officials said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents ($ 40) or simple meals. for a few euros in homemade restaurants.
The Prefecture of Calais has argued that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, arguing that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing camp population.
They commented that homemade shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to kick out the people running 72 homemade stores, but said the Calais prefecture&#39;s problems &quot;were fully understood.&quot;
Judge Jean-François Molla said groceries, cafes and restaurants played much more than just feeding people who &quot;live in extremely precarious conditions.&quot;
He said the spaces provided quiet meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One place that was threatened with demolition was the camp&#39;s Jungle Book children&#39;s cafe, which is self-serving and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors at the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children&#39;s cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian stated that closing it &quot;would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are no older than eight.&quot;
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L&#39;Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the population at the Jungle camp had grown to surpass 9,000 - the highest ever - following a sharp increase in new arrivals over the summer.
Neighborhood libraries invite young freelancers to educational programs.
This week the branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Athlete.
The programs are aimed at a children&#39;s audience, therefore, for the most part, they will be held in a playful way.
Today, on August 10, the library-branch number 2, in the linear microdistrict, invites you to a cruise presentation &quot;My town is small&quot;.
On August 11, the branch library № 1 will host a local history hour &quot;I live in this city, I know this city&quot;.
On the same day, the library-branch No. 2 will host a multimedia lesson &quot;Native land past fate&quot;.
And in the library-branch number 4 in Surazhevka - the game program &quot;Film, Film, Film&quot;.
On Sunday, August 14, for the children from the northern microdistrict, the library-branch No. 3 will hold a game program &quot;Fizkult-hello!&quot;
Britain settles on silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass allows them to take gold
Britain&#39;s impressive Rugby Sevens streak was brought to a crushing halt in the final hurdle by the Fiji team in Thursday night&#39;s final when they were completely defeated 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass on ball handling, passing, dodging, play support, line running and brute strength to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of silver - Britain&#39;s third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic Rugby Sevens tournament, which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The painful beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier in the day, could return to take a toll on them in the finals.
But, in spite of everything, Fiji in this form defeated the team of 15 people in the best possible way.
It may be some consolation for the UK - but probably not - that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji head coach Ben Ryan, former England chief from Wimbledon.
This was some kind of travel for the UK.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji got off to a great start, beating off UK interceptions for fun.
It was like bumping into a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 as Osea Kolinisau dived into a corner.
With four minutes on his watch, Jerrir Tuway added another touchdown on the right flank, which was converted.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Mitchell&#39;s magnificent interception attempt kept the mountain-man Leon Nakarava from scoring third, but that only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua hit a touchdown in the right corner and Britain was down 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after resuming and the clock was still over a minute ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then forced his way through several more sluggish interception attempts by the UK and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation resulted in 29-0 at half-time.
It looked like Fiji was born to play rugby sevens while the UK is still mastering the craft.
Which is pretty much true.
The UK made massive mid-game swaps and they plugged the Fijian dam ... for the full four minutes, which was good by first-half standards until Joshua Tuisow passed after some brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed a shot for Britain with a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game had long followed the path of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji&#39;s joyous approach.
Mata William embellished the Fijian cake that didn&#39;t need embellishment with another attempt in the final seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and Great Britain fell to the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, while Britain beat South Africa slightly in a tight semi-final of one try each - a difference British implementation.
Kyle Brown takes the Boks ahead in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great footwork, tore the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last-minute interception attempt from Marcus Watson, brother of the 15-to-side England team, Anthony, secured the victory - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover &amp; Heather Stanning Inspired To Win Rowing By Coach&#39;s Wrestling Cancer
There won&#39;t be more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first move to the last, 220 tough climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have found added value to their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two pulling the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of Coach Robin Williams was always there as they pushed for second consecutive Olympic gold in women&#39;s doubles, the first women in the annals of British sports to reach this height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, unprecedented again.
What we see, the two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
For every gold, a battalion of ready-made hands has been rowed to foster incremental victories that are essential, and there are no hands that were more important than those of a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live in order to see this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous business.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that they can operate on, and they did it.
If they don&#39;t, it goes all over the place.
This could be a pretty bad situation.
It changes your vision of the future a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he was able to start treatment in early 2014 during the offseason, keeping the schedule gap minimal if that could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed payment, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they said a few steps were enough.
This is how it starts.
Rowing is a journey in and of itself, but that makes it a little bigger.
The instant they won, their first thoughts were of Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an effort to overcome his own feelings.
Stanning, a captain of an artillery regiment with duty in Afghanistan under her belt, said: &quot;I was an emotional wreck this week, it might be a little over the top, but it means so much.&quot;
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin too.
It&#39;s been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nothing, so many thanks to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn&#39;t ask for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors have never been able to match.
Even in the last 500 meters, as the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much left.
We were very much in phase.
Helen called: &#39;stay in the process, stay in the process&#39;.
Now it is very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we weren&#39;t trying to do something amazing.
We were not expecting fireworks today, we were just waiting to be able to paddle well and get out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a couple a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at next month&#39;s wedding, on her own with TV adventurer Steve Baxhall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn&#39;t want to say that this is my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better, &quot;she said.
The government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctioned products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of food products banned from import into Russia.
The corresponding decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it is published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
It is prohibited to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs into Russia from the USA, EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
Disposal of food imported into the country in circumvention of the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sale.
Hunting for &quot;forbidden&quot;
Rains and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
An atmospheric front will pass through the metropolitan region, which will bring precipitation and lower the air temperature.
During the day, the air will warm up to 25 degrees Celsius.
So, on Saturday night in Moscow there will be short-term rain in places, thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 15 m / s are possible.
Rain with thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 12-17 m / s is expected during the day.

Precipitation is unlikely in the next working week.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the organization&#39;s rules.
Import rates exceed the obligations assumed by Russia upon joining the WTO.
&quot;This is the first time that the WTO has made a decision against the Russian Federation,&quot; reads a statement on the organization&#39;s official website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their opinion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia&#39;s measures were “systematic” or “were comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about the actions of Russia, which introduced additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in a statement by the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that US behavior in resolving disputes at the WTO undermines the organization&#39;s principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve the South Korean judge Chan Sung Hwa for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not turn to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed on Russia.
The WTO is an international organization created in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
Now it includes 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The head of the presidential administration has been replaced
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Anton Vaino, the former deputy of Sergei Ivanov, as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin reshuffled the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, during the meeting, Anton Vaino said that he considers the anti-corruption work that Ivanov has begun to carry out as head of the presidential administration is important, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the reshuffle will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader, who had been working in the presidential administration for a rather long time, has left, and has effectively built the activity of the Presidential Administration.
Instead, deputy head of the administration Anton Vaino came - a man who knows the specifics of this work very well.
In Poland, they admit that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years gas supplies from the Russian Federation may become unattractive for it due to reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by the vice-president of the Polish company for finance Boguslav Mažec.
His words are reported by TASS.
“It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main directions of supplies for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway, &quot;said Mazhec.
Currently, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG announced that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters. m of gas, which is 30% higher than the level of 2015.
The Russian gas giant&#39;s share in PGNIG&#39;s purchases rose to 49.8% from 40% a year earlier.
Let us remind you that on July 22, the Polish antimonopoly authority did not agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters. meters of gas via Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by the deputy chairman of the board of the holding, Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of Nord Stream 2 will take place in 2017, and in the fall of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its installation.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom did not plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Alexander Medvedev, deputy chairman of the board of the company.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased their gas purchases from Russia by 42%.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the very fact of the Polish PGNIG&#39;s submission of an application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company applied to the court in order to achieve a reduction in the purchase price for Russian gas.
Let us remind you that the Polish government&#39;s plenipotentiary for gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimsky, said that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland&#39;s contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, Petr Naimski, authorized by the Polish government for gas and energy infrastructure, announced that his country in six years may refuse from the supply of blue fuel from the east.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 envisages the construction of two strings of an offshore gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters. meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the Ukrainian border with Crimea.
This was announced by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
“I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area,” he said, answering a question from journalists, RIA Novosti reported.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm, no incidents affecting security have been recorded there.
Observers monitored what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at the Ufa airport appeared on the Web, which rolled out of the runway by 400 m and fell onto the left wing.
The video was published by &quot;360&quot; TV channel.
The emergency occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
The KrasAvia flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa airport operates as usual.
The Volga Investigative Directorate of Transport of the TFR began to find out the reasons for the hard landing of the liner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria Steffan de Mistura considers the fact of the incident undeniable.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about a terrorist attack using a toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
Then the opposition said that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, aviation dropped bombs with a toxic substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called stuffing.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry blamed the incident on the Harakat Nur ad-Din az-Zinki opposition group.
It soon became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed to the BBC by one of the victims.
&quot;A few minutes later I smelled gas, my eyes began to burn, it became difficult to breathe,&quot; the newspaper quotes the words of an eyewitness.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the fact of using poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be regarded as a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: &quot;There is a lot of evidence that this really happened.&quot;
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is spelled out in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the &quot;moderate opposition.&quot;
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its districts is carried out every day, and terrorists are preventing the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a &quot;humanitarian pause&quot; in hostilities.
The current regime of a daily three-hour lull in the organization is considered &quot;insufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped.&quot;
Staffan de Mistura&#39;s humanitarian advisor Jan Egeland said it would take a 48-hour ceasefire every week to bring aid to and evacuate the sick and wounded.
“We have to send bulky goods with a convoy of trucks in an area where the roads are almost destroyed, and those that remain are mined,” said Mr Egeland. &quot;But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table.&quot;
Consultations in Geneva between US and Russian representatives regarding the establishment of a &quot;humanitarian pause&quot; are continuing.
How Russia opened &quot;humanitarian windows&quot; in Aleppo.
Amid the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest city in Syria, Russia announced on August 11 a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will operate daily starting Thursday.
The creation of &quot;humanitarian windows&quot; is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the RF Ministry of Defense was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to curtail the military operation and facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in resorts in Thailand, four people were killed.
Several explosions took place in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
The attack killed four people and injured 19.
The epicenter of the explosions fell on the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, there are no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups has yet taken responsibility for the incident, but the country&#39;s Interior Ministry hastened to declare that the Islamists were not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts including Patong Beach in the Phuket area and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries showing development.
In 2016, 14 million people have already visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about goals, he added, but the country&#39;s Interior Ministry &quot;is confident that they are not connected with international extremist groups.&quot;
It is too early to draw conclusions, - said Mr. Patanacharoen. -
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any types of terrorism, in fact, they are local sabotage, and we are trying to establish the identities of those who were behind them.
The explosions took place on the birthday of Thailand&#39;s Queen Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy as one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely directed against it.
According to Sithichai Police General Shrisopacharoenrata, the bombs were detonated remotely within half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees in busy streets filled with tourists dining at restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four victims was a Thai girl selling street food.
The identities of the rest of the victims are still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, there are four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the Rostourism press service reported.
Local experts also associate the explosions with the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country&#39;s population supported the draft of the new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitutional commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament is fully appointed by the military and has a significant role in the election of the country&#39;s prime minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that on May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country&#39;s army commander Prayut Chan-Och.
This step, he said, was prompted by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, and dispersed protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok ended up in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yinglak Shinawatra, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces adjacent to the capital in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
How two explosions thundered in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the center of Bangkok, near the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, there were two explosions, as a result of which 28 people were injured, five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unknown persons on motorcycles.
Authorities have stepped up security in the capital and brought in military forces to protect the demonstrators.
Development of conditions began in Sukhoi Log.
As it became known to Kommersant, the government was asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Sukhoi Log gold deposit, while maintaining two key restrictions.
It is proposed not to admit to the auction companies where 25% or more belongs to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not have at least 25% state participation.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not even risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources submitted to the government a draft order and terms of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources familiar with the situation told Kommersant.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, one of them specifies.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed to Kommersant that the project has been submitted to the government.
Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, who is in charge of subsoil use, told Kommersant that the project had not yet been received by the official’s office.
&quot;The auction may be announced in August, immediately after the government decree was issued, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may take place in October,&quot; the Ministry of Natural Resources said.
According to Kommersant&#39;s information, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, spelled out in the version that was sent for approval to ministries and federal executive authorities in July (Kommersant has it).
The first is the presence of at least 25% state participation in the candidates&#39; capital.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the understanding of Federal Law No. 57 on foreign investment in strategic companies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law specified in the draft, as Kommersant already wrote on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to participate in the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Sukhoi Log belongs to the subsoil of federal significance (reserves over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project &quot;contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies,&quot; but declined to comment on the details pending a government order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, Kommersant was told in the Ministry of Natural Resources in December 2015 and later confirmed by the regional governor Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor Sergei Eroshchenko, who &quot;had agreements on investment projects with Rostec. &quot;&quot;.
Kommersant&#39;s interlocutors do not specify who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners.
“But this is in the spirit of the times: not to give up control of the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions,” says the source of Kommersant, who is familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskoy, announced on August 1 that foreigners &quot;can join the consortium&quot; if the applicants attract them &quot;as a financial structure, technological partners.&quot;
Kommersant&#39;s interlocutors consider it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry is considered the consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation PJSC Polyus, controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostec.
As Kommersant wrote, in July the partners created the SL Zoloto JV, where Polyus has 51% of the shares, and the Rostec RT-GR structure has 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, while Polyus told Kommersant that they were &quot;undoubtedly interested in this asset&quot; and have all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
&quot;But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions,&quot; added Polyus.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the Russian government, sources told Kommersant.
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which are developing assets in Chukotka, announced the possibility of participating in the development of Sukhoi Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, the head of the Union of Gold Producers of the Russian Federation, Sergei Kashuba, estimated Kommersant&#39;s investments in Sukhoi Log at $ 2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are scared off not only by the volume of investments, but also by the complexity of the project: serious additional exploration of reserves and technologies for working with complex ores are required, Kommersant&#39;s interlocutors in the industry explain.
The largest M&amp;A transaction has started in the pension market - KIT Finance Pension Administrator has launched the process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of Gazfond Pension Savings, an NPF will be created with an accumulation volume of about 373 billion rubles.
The launch of the procedure for merging four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promagrofond, Heritage and Gazfond Pension Savings - was announced yesterday by the owner of 100% of the funds, KIT Finance Pension Administrator.
&quot;The reorganization is carried out by agreement with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of existing contracts,&quot; the company said.
The amalgamation is carried out on the basis of &quot;Gazfond Pension Savings&quot;.
As the general director of this NPF Oleg Byaloshitsky notes, the pooling of funds allows solving several problems: expanding the geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the approximate date for the completion of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, NPF Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the volume of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reports on the funds&#39; website, the beneficiaries of their owner, KIT Finance Pension Administrator, are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLCs he owns 65%) and NPF Gazfond (35%).
However, the group itself was launched much later than its competitors.
Thus, NPF Future, controlled by the O1 group, absorbed Stalfond at the beginning of this year.
At present, this combined NPF is joining the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
&quot;Consolidation into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary for solving structural problems,&quot; said Nikolai Sidorov, general director of the NPF &quot;Future&quot;.
Active work on the consolidation of funds has been going on since April in the Safmar pension group - NPF Evropeyskiy, Obrazovanie i nauka, and Regionfond should join the NPF Safmar by the end of this year.
In 2017, NPF Doverie will join them.
&quot;The pooling of funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and expenses,&quot; said the Safmar pension group.
The pause in the pooling of funds, which was endured by KIT Finance Pension Administrator, can be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs could not redeem more than 40% of the volume of the issue of infrastructure bonds, in which the group was actively placed.
After amending the Central Bank&#39;s resolution in March this year, there are no more such restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the entire issue can be redeemed by one major player, &quot;says Yuri Nogin, director of the ACRA financial institutions ratings group.
Several heads of NPFs from the top 15 in terms of assets, another possible reason for the pause is the separation of spheres of influence and, as a result, personnel appointments in a single fund, which the owners of the group had to agree on.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
The Gazfond NPF also did not respond to Kommersant&#39;s request.
While fund consolidation is time consuming and expensive, over the long haul it will make sense.
As noted by the general director of the consulting company Pension Partner Sergei Okolesnov, Gazfond Pension Savings has fewer outflows; the merger will help stabilize the base of the group&#39;s other funds.
In this case, the more successful experience of NPF KIT Finance and Promagrofond in building retail sales of OPS, as well as using more modern software will be in demand.
The Central Bank&#39;s requirements for the processes and personnel of NPFs are constantly growing, therefore, it is inexpedient to duplicate the infrastructure at four funds with a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings at Expert RA.
&quot;The effect of reducing duplicate functions will definitely overlap the possible costs of the merger,&quot; says Mr. Mitrofanov.
Sergey Okolesnov estimates the costs of combining the four funds at 30-50 million rubles.
&quot;The costs of maintaining four funds of this size amount to about 400 million rubles per year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget can actually be cut in half,&quot; Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
The kindest Disney movie &quot;Pete and His Dragon&quot; was released in Russia.
The beautiful views of New Zealand, the touching dragon, the sentimental story and country songs are enough to re-believe in old-fashioned magic, says ELENA KRAVTSUN.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human baby both a gentle nanny and a devoted friend.
Pete names his friend Elliot, after the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in an embrace.
Six years later, he, overgrown and in a loincloth, can no longer be distinguished from another smart forest tomboy - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete is discovered by the red-haired female gamekeeper Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the gang of Gavin (Karl Urban), her husband&#39;s brother, is aggressively cutting down the forest.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help save him.
Pete takes a crash course in being human surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, have a moral code in their hearts and smile more dazzling than any commercial.
No character looks or acts too horrible for the viewer to truly hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who opened the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out to be not scary at all, with a good bulldog face, an airliner wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon hums funny, purrs, even grunts and, fortunately, does not speak, but all the time you want to stroke him, this compares favorably with all the famous cinematic dragons.
Elliot&#39;s visual image and demeanor provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only young spectators, but also adults begin to cry desperately into three streams.
Oaks Feegley is surprisingly good as a teenager in the role of Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford masterfully betrays the canonical grandfather, whom literally every child would be glad to have.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten Disney movie Pete&#39;s Dragon from 1977, mediocre from nose to tail and remembered only for a mix of animation and fiction, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
Only a miracle helped.
In his painting, Lowry, in fact, took only two things from the original: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
Musical numbers and most of the strange jokes were left behind.
This kind fairy tale features features borrowed from &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot; and many other lovely children&#39;s pictures.
Disney continues to successfully expand its gallery of high-quality 21st century remakes.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon isn&#39;t nearly as overwhelmingly beautiful as The Jungle Book, and it doesn&#39;t have the skillful villain Cate Blanchett turns out to be as stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film is no less successful in helping to believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, director Lowry will receive the keys to Disney&#39;s magic castle once again - for an artistic film adaptation of the story about &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.
Working in tandem in Pete and His Dragon, David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks entered an ambitious new project about an unmatched boy based on the tale of the same name by James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will face a new charge
The lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of an extremist structure, said that the prosecutor&#39;s office found flaws in the case of their client.
We learned from the investigators that the prosecutor&#39;s office made such an idea just yesterday.
We had planned to participate in the court session on the issue of limiting familiarization with the materials of the criminal case, but the session did not take place in the end, and the investigators told us about the submission made by the prosecutor&#39;s office, &quot;RBC quotes lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor&#39;s office indicated to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the materials collected did not match.
Now the investigators will have to fill the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with different arguments and new evidence, Ms Dinze specifies.
As Kommersant has reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded from the accusation against the RBC journalist the formulations about &quot;undermining the political situation in the direction of instability&quot; and &quot;overthrowing the government by illegal means.&quot;
Kommersantboscosport correspondent ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic Village, inspected the home of the Russian national team, dined in a local canteen and even passed the WADA test after that.
It seems that life here does not stop for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end after midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, the settlement and eviction from the village is carried out without stopping, since some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, just arrive here.
Well, already at 7:30 in the morning, the heads of all Olympic delegations stretch out to one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational everyday issues, - says Igor Kazikov, head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team. - Despite the fact that the house in which ours were housed, consider it exemplary - it was commissioned one of the first and was shown to all the inspectors, even in it there are some imperfections every now and then.
Now there are problems with hot water, then, excuse me, with toilets.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one just came to clean.
Then the cleaners began to come, but they just poke some substance on the floor, and that&#39;s all.
Their floors, you see, are some kind of innovative.
Like, you can&#39;t wash them humanly.
Yes, we know these floors are ordinary laminate!
In general, we achieved a change in the cleaning company and now everything is OK with this.
The Olympic Village is a kind of Southern Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced off on one side by mountains, on the other - by an imposing moat, in places flooded with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence around the entire perimeter, along which submachine gunners walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
A huge Russian flag hangs on one of the 18-storey buildings - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems are, apparently, the most pressing for the domestic team.
There are two announcements at the front desk: the printed &quot;Please don&#39;t throw paper in the toilet!&quot; and handwritten &quot;I will accept badges as a gift.
The stand itself is buried in booklets.
Their cheerful coloring contrasts with the titles of the brochures: &quot;A memo on infectious diseases for those traveling to Rio de Janeiro&quot;, &quot;First aid for drowning, foreign body in the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiopulmonary resuscitation&quot;, &quot;First aid for burns, heatstroke, fractures and bleeding. &quot;
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, this: &quot;Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not everyone will have a favorable outcome.
Of course, the Russian national team has a medical center, which is ready to provide the residents of the house with qualified assistance at any time, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is the actual headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster &quot;In spite of everything, we will win!&quot;
And, of course, poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who are afraid believe in them.
Let the smaller of us, the sweeter the taste of victories, Russia will not retreat, not break!
And for even greater upliftment of the spirits, there is an announcement: &quot;Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev carries out spiritual care for the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order a prayer service and other services by phone ...
In general, on the territory of the village there is a Center for Meditation and Religious Rites for representatives of all confessions.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, are in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the workload of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which are recommended to be used during a fire.
And in the dark he stumbled over the bodies lying on her.
Apparently, these were the sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I suppose, ready to rush to cleaning innovative floors at any moment, they decided to arrange a quiet hour for themselves directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I met with an old acquaintance - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our trampolines, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
Generally speaking, there is nothing to complain about, - the honored coach of Russia shares his impressions. - We live in twos, the beds, of course, are almost end-to-end, but this is not critical.
The bathroom is one for four, but spacious.
The wardrobe, of course, is ridiculous, made of fabric, it does not inspire confidence, but things can be put.
&quot;No, well, you are guessing, they have run out of tea!&quot; - tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, who I met in the main dining room, throws up her hands.
It is called the main one, if only because it represents an area of 2.7 thousand square meters. m and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
Here they give out 60 thousand servings a day completely free of charge.
The menu options are: Best of Brazil, Cuisine of the World, Asian Food and Pizza, Pasta.
The last option, as I saw it, is very popular among our volleyball players.
At the same time, for example, I did not find any soups in any of the subdivisions of the giant restaurant.
What soups? - Kuznetsova is surprised. - No tea!
It&#39;s good that I brought some Chinese with me, a custard.
And a kettle.
But in general, so that you understand, the food on our courts is even worse.
Here at least something you can choose, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish there is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, quite, I must admit, it was edible.
I don&#39;t even understand why there is such a line all the time at the local McDonald&#39;s.
Well-fed, relaxed, one might say &quot;warm&quot; athletes at the exit from the restaurant are waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They lure you deftly - with a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
They provoke, one might say!
To receive a gift, you must correctly answer at least eight questions out of ten.
Have questions in Russian! - the girl from WADA attacked me.
But she attacked the wrong one.
That is, I harnessed myself in a patriotic impulse, of course.
The situation became aggravated already on the second question: &quot;If I received a notification about the passage of the doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?&quot;
I settled on option B: &quot;No - I have one hour.&quot;
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that there is no need to expect indulgences from WADA.
In general, you must appear immediately.
Well, on the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became completely critical.
For some reason I thought that if I find it difficult to maintain a balanced diet due to my busy schedule (and, by the way, it is difficult for me!), Then I can use supplements to get &quot;additional nutrients to increase my performance.&quot;
But no, they don&#39;t!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically prohibited, but strongly, in several sentences it is discouraged.
This WADA is playing unfairly!
How are you, Russia? - the quiz host asks mockingly.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbaev and our whole bloodless team.
So I concentrated and with the last bit of strength won the unfortunate T-shirt.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I wandered into the fitness center next door.
I got carried away with counting simulators.
Lost by 250.
I was surprised to note that not a single Russian athlete was found in this jumble of treadmills.
But maybe it is correct?
Let the one who does not know how to train train!
But in the nearby clinic one of our guys was sitting.
In line to see the optometrist.
Don&#39;t worry, not a shooter.
In the clinic, however, as well as throughout the village, wherever you spit, there is a machine for dispensing condoms.
It bears an inspiring message: &quot;Celebrate with a condom!&quot;
Then all that remains is to twist a piece of iron that resembles the handle of a door lock, and the condom, made of natural Amazon latex, readily falls out of the apparatus.
I took one for myself, as a keepsake.
The athletes will not lose anything - they were brought in 450 thousand of them.
Just for a festive and idle pastime, there is a whole entertainment center in the Olympic Village.
Near it, just in case, there is an educational sign reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $ 3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is awash with video games, billiard and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange video simulators.
What is this? - I am interested in a friend in the uniform of the Ukrainian national team, who actively uses an outlandish toy.
I could, of course, just say that he doesn&#39;t want to talk to a man in the uniform of the Russian national team, and that&#39;s all.
Here, by the way, due to some strange coincidence of circumstances, the guys in the zhovto-blakitnoye are dazzling in the eyes.
The most playing team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the whole village, looking into every corner of it.
But, if you walk, and not ride electric cars, you will see the house of the Canadian national team with an elk at the entrance and a tent with a recovery bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaner, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods. consumption, and mail with unique stamps (only you still cannot wait out the queue of Chinese philatelists), and a bank, and a lost property, and a photo kiosk.
And late in the evening you, exhausted, will sit down near an olive tree hung with colorful ribbons in memory of friends and relatives of athletes who have left this world.
And you will, to the accompaniment of a machine randomly spraying liquid to kill insects, think about the eternal.
That is, about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world watched with bated breath as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know: I was the first to receive the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in foil at the XXXI Olympic Games.
Maybe I&#39;m even the only Muscovite who saw how it happened - apart from those, of course, who watched the competition at Carioca that evening.
This can only be understood by a real fan.
Just imagine: a dead Moscow night.
The neighbors downstairs - as always by one in the morning - wake up and begin to shout at each other without malice, but very loudly.
And moving furniture threateningly.
There is a faucet in the kitchen - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
Nothing is clear about the television schedule, so I just kept control of the channels &quot;Match&quot;, &quot;First&quot; and, just in case, &quot;Russia&quot; - although this is almost pointless.
&quot;Russia&quot; is the birthplace of repetitions, all sports are there for some reason in the record.
There, serials are broadcast live.
Hope, of course, for the &quot;Match&quot; - the whole evening the young man shouted in the news first about the great semifinals of Deriglazov - Shanaev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead basketball - USA - Australia.
By the way, I can&#39;t say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on an equal footing, they won the first half.
They replaced the Americans who were crazy about their own greatness.
As a result, they still lost, but, as they say now, the Olympic basketball tournament will not be the same.
This is all good, but the fight with Di Franchiska is approaching, and nothing changes on the screen.
In a slight panic, I start flipping through the channels.
It feels like they are playing it for the second time in a row.
Okay, let&#39;s go inland, to the cable ones.
There is no fencing at any of the thematic &quot;Matches&quot;.
And, according to my feelings, the battle is about to begin.
Text and tweet broadcasts of some sports sites do not suit me.
Spasmodic surfing gives unexpected but brilliant results.
On the site of &quot;First&quot;, it turns out, there is a live technical broadcast of all the competitions that are taking place at this point in time.
I click on fencing, I get a duel for gold.
Deriglazova perfectly counterattacks, goes ahead on points - and quite obviously starts to play for time.
The Italian wins back almost the entire gap.
Ours is one point ahead, a little over two seconds to the end.
Di Franchiska rushes at Deriglazova, she retreats, time is running out, the Italian gives an injection.
Victory!
A couple of seconds later, the Olympic messenger on the phone announces the fourth gold medal.
It turns out that I am the first one who saw it with my own eyes.
Crazy, faithful, involved.
The Spiritual Administration of Muslims (SAM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday the plenum of the SAM ordered its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar, in order to force the young Tatars to &quot;learn their native language.&quot;
The department says that this &quot;in no way infringes&quot; the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
Some mosques in Kazan complain that up to 60% of parishioners do not understand the Tatar language, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar &quot;will not reach the entire audience.&quot;
Yesterday the plenum of the SAM of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the republic&#39;s mosques only in the Tatar language.
As the mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin stated, this should become an incentive for young Tatars &quot;to learn their native language.&quot;
“For those who say it’s hard, in every big mosque we intend to organize Tatar language lessons absolutely free of charge,” Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that &quot;the decision has already entered into force&quot; and today sermons in all mosques &quot;should already be in the Tatar language.&quot;
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the Shura magazine with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam who does not speak Tatar well enough &quot;can thoroughly prepare for them.&quot;
DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, Friday sermons in the districts are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, in a number of mosques, the predominantly Russian language was previously used.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, it was practiced in the Burnaevskaya mosque, Zakabannaya and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, the leadership sets the task for all students to speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
&quot;There can be no question of any infringement on the netatar Muslims,&quot; Mr. Mukhametshin emphasized, explaining that the sermon itself &quot;is not an obligatory, the main part of namaz.&quot;
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian will remain in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was no serious threat of ousting the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar, other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to his information, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision of the SAM was actively supported by the executive committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WKT).
The head of the VKT executive committee Rinat Zakirov told Kommersant: &quot;Mosques are an important part of our national life.&quot;
It would be sad if the Tatar language left this sphere.
He noted that preaching only in the Tatar language is &quot;the desire of the imams themselves,&quot; but the executive committee of the CGT &quot;considers it correct.&quot;
The imams interviewed by Kommersant, who preached in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the SAM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties understanding the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
They, of course, will be a little tight.
&quot;We&#39;ll have to rebuild,&quot; says Farhat Mavletdinov, imam of the Burnaevskaya mosque.
According to him, sermons in Russian are closer even to many Tatars, since &quot;Russian is in schools, in kindergartens, on the radio — everywhere from the very beginning.&quot;
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue the lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on Allah.
Allah will show a way out of this situation, &quot;he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
“Therefore, we switched to Russian for four years,” says the imam.
He believes that sermons in the Tatar language will &quot;reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience.&quot;
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
Just the result of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
&quot;For me, for example, it will only be easier, because the Tatar language is my native language,&quot; concluded Gabdulla Galiullin.
Former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service put on trial
The Moscow Prosecutor&#39;s Office approved the indictment on the criminal case investigated by the Main Investigative Directorate of the ICR on embezzlement of budget funds allocated for the needs of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
The ex-head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy, who caused damage to the Federal Penitentiary Service in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles, will appear before the court.
The capital&#39;s prosecutor&#39;s office sent a criminal case against the former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the FSUE Center for Information Technology Support and Communication of the Federal Service for the Execution of Punishments (FSUE CITOS) Viktor Definedov to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused of the Main Investigative Directorate of the TFR in Moscow under Part 3 of Art. 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of office, entailing grave consequences), part 4 of Art. 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using one&#39;s official position, as part of an organized group, on an especially large scale).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Part 1 of Art. 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the TFR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury budget funds allocated by the Federal Penitentiary Service to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, the so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal budget money, the group members developed a scheme, according to which the enterprise under their control, FGUP CITOS, with which the corresponding state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including &quot;electronic bracelets&quot;, and sold them at prices that were inflated several times.
Despite the fact that FGUP TsITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, structures for the placement of production facilities, allowing to create a complete cycle of production of &quot;electronic bracelets&quot;, between it and the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia were concluded five government contracts worth more than 3.3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, the accounts of the Samara branch of the FSUE turned out to be more than 2 billion rubles, of which 1.2 billion rubles. was kidnapped.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles. The cashed funds were received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, the criminal case against which was separated into a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the fraud, was found to have cartridges for the award pistol of unknown origin, which made it possible to bring additional charges against him.
In this case, the volume of which amounted to 133 volumes, the Federal Penitentiary Service filed a claim against the accused for compensation for material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.
Football player Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
The Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for the former footballer and later MP Hakan Shukur and ransacked two of his family&#39;s homes.
Turkish football star of the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Shukur is wanted by the Turkish authorities in connection with the attempted coup d&#39;état last month.
The forward, who retired from his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an &quot;armed terrorist group.&quot;
It is about the Hizmet movement, a society associated with the famous Turkish religious figure and opposition leader Fethullah Gülen.
It is his President Erdogan who considers the organizer of the attempted military coup on July 15.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, the Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media reports, an arrest warrant for Hakan Shukur was issued today, and the police have already conducted searches in two houses that belong to the family of the former football player.
According to the investigation, in addition to Hakan Shukur himself, his father was part of Fethullah Gulen&#39;s organization.
However, neither the former football player himself, nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
When he was a footballer, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team of the country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian &quot;Torino&quot;, &quot;Inter&quot; and &quot;Palermo&quot;, as well as the English &quot;Blackburn&quot;.
True, in none of them he spent more than one season.
Hakan Shukur is still the most productive striker of the Turkish national team: he has 112 appearances for the national team and 51 goals scored.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his parliamentary post due to a corruption investigation that began around Erdogan&#39;s party and his inner circle.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, arrest warrants were issued in Turkey on July 25 for at least 42 journalists.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and ties with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the gravity of the charges, media workers can face lengthy prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Yegor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
&quot;I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than films of foreign production,&quot; he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for viewers with major Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 films are made annually, of which on average 20-25 films reach the screens.

The Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK has taken up the modernization of one of the oldest and most environmentally &quot;dirty&quot; enterprises in the country - the Karabash copper-smelting plant.
The Karabash Copper Smelter was founded by an English joint-stock company headed by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was an industrial enterprise that was significant for the country&#39;s economy, and it actually provided the life of an entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which led to serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash copper-smelting plant.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already notorious as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise came under the control of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize its production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in early July.
The head of the South Urals called the changes that have taken place with the enterprise since the time Karabashmed moved to the RMK group as grandiose.
The main activity for the modernization of Karabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulfuric acid shop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian Copper Company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of CJSC &quot;Karabashmed&quot; is the reconstruction of the converter conversion.
Replacement of three converters, dust covers, gas duct is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment plant worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes paid to the budget of the city of Karabash will also grow.
Over the entire period of the Tominsky GOK project - from the start of construction to the commissioning of the second stage - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the GOK is put into operation, tax receipts to the budgets of all levels may amount to 80.9 billion rubles.
For the year of operation of production in the Varna region, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to the budgets of different levels.
And this is the first year.
&quot;The longer the enterprise has been successfully operating, the higher the amount of deductions may be,&quot; added Valery Ulanovsky.
RCC clarified that in 2015 tax deductions from Mikheevsky GOK approached 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RCC enterprises in the life and development of the territories of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
RCC&#39;s enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and improve areas.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabash was a major overhaul, and in fact, an almost complete restructuring of kindergarten N9 for 95 children.
The building, built in 1960, was in disrepair.
Also on the territory of &quot;RMK Arena&quot; there will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and aboveground parking lots for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
&quot;RMK Arena&quot; will make it possible to hold spectacular professional sports events of the international level.
But the main task of this project is to make physical education and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to residents of Chelyabinsk, primarily for children.

WSJ: The United States is considering the introduction of sanctions against the Russian Federation due to the hacking of the Democrats&#39; servers.
US officials are considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of the Democratic Party&#39;s servers, The Wall Street Journal writes, citing sources.
Reportedly, in order to impose sanctions, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to formally blame Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities for the attack on the servers.
According to sources, the FBI and other US intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia&#39;s involvement in the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that generally the United States prefers not to identify by name those who carry out hacker attacks.
An exception is the 2014 hack of a Sony Entertainment Pictures database, which was officially blamed on the DPRK.
However, last year Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but can be used against other countries as well.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be lengthy, the newspaper writes.
Even if the officials concluded that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, before deciding on the disclosure of information, they will have to weigh the possible consequences.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the Obama administration admits the possibility of applying sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked into the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks has published emails from the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in the hacking.
The Kremlin called such messages absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the violation of competition in the mobile application market.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company argued that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components on terms that prohibit preinstallation of applications from other developers, in particular from Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company was abusing its dominant position in the market and forcing mobile device manufacturers to install other applications along with the Google Play store.
As a result of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, said Deputy Head of the FAS Alexei Dotsenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including transnational corporations, must comply with the law on the protection of competition.
In turn, Google intends to first study the decision and only then decide on further actions: to execute it or challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violation of the competition law back in September last year and ordered that the contracts be adjusted by December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding an amicable agreement.
This measure will lead nowhere.
Eldar Murtazin, a leading analyst at Mobile research group, expressed this opinion to Ekho Moskvy.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect either users or the corporation&#39;s competitiveness.

&quot;If, as of January 1, information about the owners of real estate and owners of land plots will be transferred to us, then next year the citizens of Crimea will be payers of these taxes,&quot; said Roman Nazdrachev.
For privileged categories of citizens, benefits will be provided for the payment of property taxes, first of all, this is the category of pensioners.
Also, there is a system of deductions for land tax depending on the preferential category of the taxpayer, but, according to the head of the Federal Tax Service, it is too early to talk about this until 2017.
A resident of Balakhna stood up for a woman, breaking her offender&#39;s head with a brick
According to the investigation, on the night of June 16, 2016, in the garage array on Holovaya Street in Balakhna, the accused saw the quarrels between the roommates with whom he had visited the day before.
The man repeatedly insulted his common-law wife, and then put the woman on his shoulder and carried her home.
The attacker stood up for the woman and hit the victim on the head with a brick several times.
The 29-year-old man died instantly.
The accused admitted guilt in part.
At the moment (August 12, 2016), this is all information.
A terrible accident occurred the night before in the area of the Kizil-Tash tract of the Crimean Peninsula.
As MK in Volgograd was informed in the press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Russia in the Volgograd Region, at 5.05 pm a regular bus with people in the cabin was traveling along the P-29 Sudak - Feodosia highway.
Suddenly the car turned into a ditch and fell off a cliff.
Five people became victims of the road traffic accident, another 20 were injured.
The victims from the crash site were taken to medical facilities by ambulance cars, where doctors provide them with the necessary assistance.
In that ill-fated flight, four residents of the Volgograd region were seriously injured.
These are Yuri and Elena Krivokhizhin from Kotovo together with their 9-year-old grandson Artem, as well as 5-year-old Anastasia Bochkareva, who was taken to the regional hospital in Simferopol - the girl is in serious condition.
When calling an ambulance, we hope that the team will arrive quickly and the doctors will provide all the necessary qualified assistance.
When to call an ambulance, how quickly should it come to the patient?
In case of an emergency call for an ambulance, the nearest free mobile ambulance team or a specialized team is sent to the call.
The time of arrival of an ambulance for an emergency call is up to 20 minutes.
The time of arrival of an ambulance for an emergency call is up to 2 hours.
The time of arrival of an ambulance after a death is declared is not regulated.
OSCE observers did not record any military activity on the Crimean border.
Observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) did not record any military activity on the Russian-Ukrainian border.
This is stated in a statement published on the organization&#39;s website.
Observers report that the situation on the Crimean border is calm, no incidents that may somehow be related to the security of Ukraine and Russia have been recorded.
&quot;None of the observers were able to confirm media reports that related to security issues, including gunfire and hostilities in the immediate vicinity of the administrative boundary line,&quot; the OSCE report said.
The organization&#39;s employees continue to monitor the situation at three checkpoints on the border in the area of the Ukrainian cities of Kalanchak, Chaplinka and the Chongar Peninsula in the Sivash Bay.
Earlier, the State Border Service of Ukraine reported that the rotation of Russian troops was nearing completion on the Crimean border.
At the same time, according to the department, the updated personnel has more modern equipment.
Bulgaria shows inflation for the 1st time in 8 months
Inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July, according to national statistics.
This is the highest figure in years (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was shown.
Average annual inflation, measured by the CPI, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, in comparison with the previous month, an increase was observed in the price of the following groups of consumer goods: food and soft drinks (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, appliances and regular maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication systems; and education.
Snapchat&#39;s &quot;Anime&quot; effect criticized as caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims this filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it&#39;s racially tactless.
With the Lenses tool, Snapchat is allowing its roughly 150 million users a day to change reality and play with personality in ways that border on the absurd.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to match a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are rough, contorting tools that create over 30 million corrected selfies per day.
Any mistakes quickly become common knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past for being accused of promoting dark complexions or promoting whitened faces as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them slanting eyes, crooked teeth and chubby cheeks, some critics saw it as a racist caricature of &quot;yellow-faced&quot; Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions point to a broader diversity issue for the company.
Messages spread on Wednesday, followed by outrage in reports on The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: The lens was intended as an homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to experts who know about racism firsthand, the lens reminded offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was heavily shared about the photographs, said the lens was &quot;offensive and at least awkward.&quot;
She added that “it&#39;s hard to argue with the side-by-side comparison of very crude Asian cartoons and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but extremely pejoratively yellow-faced.
Snapchat isn&#39;t the only company crossing these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diverse than their older generation - may mean they are more likely to be understood.
When one of Snapchat&#39;s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, &quot;this turn of events is much more difficult to go unnoticed as it used to be.&quot;
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes racial divisions are responsible for the lack of diversity in Snapchat&#39;s recruitment.
Zhu criticized the company&#39;s predominantly white, all-male leadership and ended her article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, who is herself a Chinese American, wrote: “Either they didn’t have enough non-white people on staff to make these decisions, or they’re employed non-white people, but they don’t occupy positions in which it is safe and speak out openly. &quot;
Other observers share her point of view, complaining that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origins of its staff on Thursday, but a trustee said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the under-represented population and actively seek to engage in-house resources.
For her part, Zhu said she will keep her Snapchat account private, adding, &quot;I&#39;m wondering if they really need more users like us to say it won&#39;t work that way.&quot;
Military leadership distorted intelligence on ISIS, congressional commission reports
Officials from the U.S. Armed Forces Central Command have modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground suggest, the congressional committee said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report by a task force set up by the Republican Chairmen of the House Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the War Appropriations Subcommittee found &quot;widespread discontent&quot; among Central Command intelligence analysts who claim that leaders tweaked their assessments of US action victory over the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida that oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
&quot;Intelligence documents approved by the high command of the Centcom tended to provide a more optimistic portrayal of US counterterrorism activities than is confirmed by real data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence services,&quot; - said in a news release about the report ...
&quot;What happened at Centcom is unacceptable: when top management is presented with an unreliable analysis, our military suffers,&quot; said Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Problems with leadership in the Central Committee reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the flaws that continually surfaced in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions to train the Iraqi armed forces provided by Central Command.
While it does not provide conclusive evidence that members of the Obama administration&#39;s leadership ordered the reports to be falsified, he argues that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIL.
&quot;Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and testimonies from Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than actual events,&quot; the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at returning Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq&#39;s second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
&quot;After months of investigation, we know for sure,&quot; Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the most senior intelligence officials at US Central Command forged the command&#39;s intelligence documents to downplay the ISIS threat in Iraq.
Republicans formed a task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State was being falsified.
As the investigation progresses, more detailed data will follow the report released on Thursday.
An additional, currently unfinished investigation into Centcom&#39;s intelligence is being conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense.
Democratic representatives on the House Intelligence Committee of the US Congress released their own data Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly closed procedure for producing intelligence assessments regarding ISIS and the Iraqi security forces,” Rep. Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic Party&#39;s chief spokesman on the committee, said in a statement.
The procedure, according to Schiff, &quot;stalled the release of intelligence documents&quot;, damaged the morale of analysts and &quot;did not sufficiently reflect divergent views.&quot;
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House tried to force Central Committee analysts to tailor their conclusions to &quot;a given or political interpretation.&quot;
The preliminary findings of the Congressional investigation were released on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon Inspector General following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the Congressional report while the Inspector General&#39;s investigation continued.
But he said that &quot;experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics.&quot;
The ramifications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is achieving its goals (as more and more Defense officials are now claiming).
But last year&#39;s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on Central Command to provide accurate assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State echoes controversy more than a decade ago, when Central Committee intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that the administration of President George Walker Bush, over protest from many analysts, had come out in support of small numbers of troops in Iraq and didn&#39;t think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the Islamic State intelligence protest.
Last year, officials said Hooker&#39;s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes against Islamic State-owned refineries did not significantly worsen the terrorist group&#39;s financial position because it built temporary refineries. to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not circulated outside of Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then commander of the Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many MPs considered overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in General Command. Joseph L. Votel.
USA wins 4 consecutive women&#39;s field hockey, moving closer to a decisive showdown with Britain
After scoring three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam opened the scoring on Thursday with her first two goals for the US women&#39;s field hockey team when the Americans beat India 3-0. ...
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, says she&#39;s not sure if she&#39;d ever do something like this.
&quot;I can&#39;t imagine,&quot; she said.
I&#39;m not really the type of person to track my goals.
Here&#39;s what she knows: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they are competing for first place in their group with Britain, which remains undefeated after losing to Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Teams Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams will qualify for the quarter-finals, and the outcome of the game will determine who takes first place in their group of six teams and who takes second.
The winner will avoid meeting a strong rival team from Holland, leaders of the other group, a little later, when the games of the quarterfinals begin.
However, Saturday&#39;s game shows that the Americans here have made a splash with their unexpected streak, four years after they finished last among 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took on a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at age 16, becoming her youngest ever. a player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the final squad.
Then came 2012 when things were not going well for her and her teammates.
The following year, Coeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach and things began to change.
&quot;A cultural change, a psychological change, a change in fitness,&quot; Bam said.
In London, we had a different performance than we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a short throw from an awkward hand.
India went into the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the lead.
She made a long run with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and threw the ball into the goal, giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The dry win was the first in the tournament for US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who conceded one goal in each of his first three wins.
She is on fire.
So is Bam.
&quot;We&#39;re in a good position right now,&quot; Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday&#39;s game.
In the midst of the frenzy of the Olympic Games - the Zen of trampoline jumping
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, this is the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem constant and inevitable, a frenzied mix of competition and drive.
It is as if the Olympic flame itself is that burning torch that is transmitted from an archer to a swimmer, to a gymnast, to a triathlete.
You can&#39;t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or overhear your neighbors taking turns in a cafe and not hear about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clos.
And then there&#39;s Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian, dimpled handsome man, could very well be among the prime-time celebrities promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for gold in the Olympic trampoline competition.
The Olympic flame does not cover all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, there are sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Breaststroke will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I am allowed to shyly speak out in defense of my personal addiction, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of trampoline jumping.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has received so little acceptance over the past 16 years that many people I interviewed were not aware that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competitions, they never won medals in trampoline jumping, and their athletes did not make it to the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians, as a rule, share among themselves men&#39;s awards, while the Chinese and Canadians share women&#39;s awards.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But jumping on a trampoline has an outsider charm, in part because for the unenlightened ear it is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must confess that I am not an expert, but only a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They do have comic potential - it&#39;s a caricature of endless leaps - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that they mostly combine.
The word &quot;trampoline&quot; comes from the Spanish word &quot;el trampolín&quot;, which means &quot;diving board&quot;.
The contenders jump on a giant trampoline, soaring nearly 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (twists, bends, and flips) before finally landing on their feet.
They are judged on performance, difficulty and &quot;flight time&quot; according to the official Olympic Games program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
Medal contenders must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They are striving not only for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in full view of the TV cameras, for another tantalizing milestone: a world or Olympic record.
This stubborn aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to make even the viewer cry.
But it is, in my opinion, somewhat tiresome when watching the Games.
From him jumping on a trampoline gives a break.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps, appears weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And in them, of course, it is not without competition or difficulties, but during the entire program there is no mad zeal for the finish, no long jumps, only a wondrous, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
The women&#39;s qualifiers, followed by the finals, will take place on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1pm ET; men - on Saturday, also at one o&#39;clock.
NBC will air the finale as part of the daytime program starting at 2:00 pm on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily overlooked in a common junkyard.
And if a rise in consciousness can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to coveted views and objectification - as male gymnasts from the United States recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal, - Dooley is just waiting for her new admiring crowd of fans.
Generation protests in Ethiopia, longtime US ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced fierce opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of a split?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a staunch ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to more and more territories.
In the past week alone, thousands have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights defenders said the government&#39;s response was brutal.
Eyewitnesses claimed that dozens of unarmed demonstrators were shot and killed by police officers.
Videos from protest sites, allegedly filmed late last year or early this year, show security officers beating young men with sticks when they were pushed against a wall.
The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult in the future,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project at the international crisis research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia&#39;s economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And its streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations constantly mention government repression - opposition on the territory of the state was suppressed, due to the fact that dissidents were effectively silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that could change.
&quot;If people are constantly suppressed and left with no choice but to protest, there will be an uprising,&quot; said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to a government coalition&#39;s takeover of power.
Following a widely criticized election last year, the government party and its allies have completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing along the border with Eritrea; fighting over this vague, contested border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that secessionist groups that have been more or less wiped out in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings that have been simmering in the depths of the soul for several years now flare up.
The first, it would seem, is completely harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media as cheap smartphones have become mainstream and internet service has improved.
Even when the government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that was how they organized for the protests.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara, from Ethiopia&#39;s predominantly Christian highlands, has thrived in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in low-lying areas.
But that is also changing.
“We will act together under a single leadership,” said Oromo leader Mulat Gemechu.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo districts.
Many in Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and which controls the military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia&#39;s prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using scouts to gain intelligence and neutralize opponents.
&quot;The current regime lacks common sense,&quot; said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia&#39;s new prime minister, Hailemariam Desaleni, appeared out of nowhere and took Meles&#39; place.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a Southerner.
Analysts say he is not trusted by the security services controlled by Tygra.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed as a result.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said was apparently an election that the government screwed up and then falsified the results.
In the ensuing repression, many Protestants were killed, albeit in fewer numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia&#39;s leaders for forward-thinking infrastructure developments such as a new intercity train and significant gains in poverty reduction.
But this has clearly not stopped the rise of domestic discontent with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked Tygrai-owned businesses, and anti-Tygrai hatred on social media is pervasive.
Analysts say the protesters are embarrassing the United States and other Western allies.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
&quot;And this tightrope will be difficult to walk on,&quot; Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama with &quot;sarcasm&quot;
Donald J. Trump tried to hush up the latest conflict that gripped his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he stated several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the &quot;founders&quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the GOP presidential candidate&#39;s ability to communicate intelligibly to the American people.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Having voiced this suggestion at the convention on Wednesday night, Trump strongly insisted on his statement on Thursday, reiterating in interviews that he really wanted to say that the President and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Trump tweeted that he was just being sneering.
This post was the exact opposite of a statement made just a day earlier, when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not seize the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to reorient his campaign to the economy amid a decline in ratings.
Trump and Clinton delivered rival speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to revisit the topic.
Again using Twitter, he warned that Clinton&#39;s plans would lead to tax increases and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm as an excuse.
In late July, after drawing widespread criticism by practically suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton&#39;s e-mail, he later explained his remarks by saying, &quot;Of course I&#39;m kidding.&quot;
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is acceptable in political speech and take his words back when necessary.
&quot;I think this is his way of testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, watching them act, and then &#39;explaining&#39; them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,&quot; said Ruth Sherman, an expert on communication, which analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he is careful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to interpret them differently.
Rather than softening his voice for the wider electorate, Trump has taken an even more caustic tone in recent days as his approval ratings continue to plummet.
A new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist rating released Friday showed Trump to be far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and on par with Florida.
While Trump tends to try not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has become the object of increased attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York mayor who is one of Trump&#39;s most prominent deputies, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
&quot;I think what he is saying is an acceptable political comment,&quot; Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump&#39;s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it not a threat, absolutely unfair, and that&#39;s why it happened, because it withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most average Republicans claim that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to evolve by failing to tackle the Middle East hard.
Ahead of the Pennsylvania rally on Friday, Trump continued to tweet the media for beating his every word and bias against him.
He mocked the &quot;poor unfortunate&quot; TV experts who are trying to figure it out, and said: &quot;They are weak!&quot;
Some Democrats ridiculed Trump&#39;s excuses as further confirmation that he was not fit for the presidency.
The once displaced coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Coffee Shop was a run-down cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn&#39;t have wifi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was ousted from her display room on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Sheri, which took over from Verb in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Local residents mourned her as the last loss in the renovating city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: &quot;New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can&#39;t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a soap shop.&quot;
But while New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is being updated.
The revived Verb coffee shop opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verba has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but has some of the same staff and a similar simple atmosphere.
Plus the coffee is still good.
The new Verba is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He started working at Verba in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him for a new location, he said he would gladly do it.
Rodriguez, 36, has left a lot of things as they were.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old &quot;Verba&quot;.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He suggested new dishes.
The menu features bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches and caper or fried onion toppings.
There are brown rice dishes.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now freshly squeezed juices are made.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old, repeat customers.
&quot;A lot of former customers have also been squeezed out of Williamsburg with prices,&quot; he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and frequent the Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still stopped by there.
After Verba closed, she said that she had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verba,” she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, although that day instead of the usual ice coffee, she ordered blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a devoted visit to Verb since 2003.
He stopped by before work and ordered the same thing.
“At fifteen minutes past seven, every day, like clockwork, I came, and they prepared my bagel with butter and all the fillings for me,” he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but one day he will change something with bacon, egg or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said that he was not offended that the soap shop once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Sheri proposed to make a special soap for Verba, using coffee from a coffee shop, prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
&quot;I think we might agree to their proposal,&quot; Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin have also chosen this coffee house.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for him in the window so his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other benefits as well.
A local juice outlet plans to bottle and sell cold-brewed coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will take over an adjacent building.
For many customers it is enough that the new &quot;Verb&quot; will include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Witt was a regular and shared that he was heartbroken when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened at its new location, Witt said that by going inside and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt like he was back home.
&quot;How long have I wanted to smell this scent,&quot; he admitted.
Depressive Depression Food in &quot;Heavy Meal&quot;
In March 1933, shortly after taking office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to dine in the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt loved Fifth Avenue trendy dishes such as foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and prune pudding for dessert.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who were suffering,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: &quot;It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.&quot;
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are experts in food history.
Coa&#39;s latest book, Chinese Stew, focused on Chinese food in America, and Siegelman told the story of living in a rented apartment on the Lower East Side through food in her book 97 Orchard Street.
Their new collaboration, &quot;Heavy Meal,&quot; to be published Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food during the Great Depression.
In a somewhat culinary solidarity of their own, they met the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg&#39;s Sandwich Shop, a tiny, unpretentious eatery in the Flatiron Quarter that has been operating since the 1929 Stock Crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sliced sandwich, while Coe, 57, ordered a turkey, mashed potatoes, and a vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered the meatloaf, the couple found it a good starting point for a discussion about Depression-era food.
&quot;The rolls were in high demand,&quot; Siegelman said.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to be stretched.
Imagine eating as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe winced.
“He must have been lying like a stone in his stomach,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a buffet.
Groups of women cooked for the male farm workers, and a freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the starving Europeans during the First World War. &quot;A Heavy Meal&quot; describes how a country coped with what was suddenly no longer a land of plenty.
“It was a time when food became a central, challenging topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally challenging was the new budgetary diet: mysterious dishes such as rolls and casseroles became staples; A casserole is &quot;a great way to dispose of leftovers,&quot; Siegelman observed, &quot;because chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, the staple of American food for many years, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While doing research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish from that era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
&quot;This addition to the dining table was not a success,&quot; Coe said.
Siegelman added: &quot;It was very strange.&quot;
Peanut butter doesn&#39;t go well with baked onions.
This has been the case for many homemade recipes.
More than ever, and never since then, home economists - including Louise Stanley, chief of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - have ruled the country&#39;s dietary habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget makers,” rise to the challenge, and transform a burda like mashed spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
A &quot;hearty meal&quot; is a feast of curious historical facts.
Especially juicy stories about the government&#39;s reaction to starving citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of &quot;let them eat the pies.&quot;
Publicly extolling simple Iowa farm concoctions from his childhood days, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he&#39;d become.
“He liked continental food like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate in a practically gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely uninterested in taste, and this led the White House to &quot;eat not only the dullest food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgusting cooked.&quot;
Many of the culinary techniques of the Depression era were forgotten once the country was back on its feet.
Their legacy is our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Siegelman says, and how science has been used in food preparation.
The couple say that while writing the book, they better understood the eating habits of Siegelman&#39;s mother - that she could not throw food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of being careless about food,” Coe said.
Siegelman recalls: &quot;She poisoned people in all seriousness.&quot;
There was one unpleasant incident with profiteroles.
When the plates at Eisenberg&#39;s were empty, she and Coe pulled out a dessert they had made at home: the prune dessert President Roosevelt had for lunch.
&quot;It&#39;s called prune mousse,&quot; Siegelman said, adding that it was a common practice to give humble recipes catchy names.
There was no whipped cream, only prunes, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped the spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it wasn&#39;t bad.
Coe has asked for supplements twice.
In the voice of a confident budget planner, he told his wife, &quot;A little chopped walnuts would be nice.&quot;
The arrest of the defendants in the case of the mass brawl at the Khovanskoye cemetery extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left the defendants in the case of the mass brawl at the Khovanskoye cemetery under arrest until November 14, having satisfied the corresponding request of the investigation.
In the case, 14 people are accused.
Recall that on May 14 at the Khovanskoye cemetery there was a mass brawl of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons, as a result of which three people died.
Former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and lawyer, co-founder of the public organization &quot;Healthy Nation&quot; Alexander Bocharnikov was charged with organizing the murder.
The question of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was announced on August 12 by the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during her visit to the Bryansk region.
We have laid down specific parameters for how much it is necessary to raise pensions in order to level the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Now economists are summing up the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks, &quot;Interfax quotes Golodets.
Commenting on the scheme for raising the retirement age by six months every year, proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Research Alexei Kudrin, the Deputy Prime Minister said that this topic is not being considered in the Cabinet.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan made it to the finals of the small-bore rifle shooting competition.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan made it to the finals of the small bore rifle prone competition at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualifications.
Kirill Grigorian came in second with 628.9 past.
In total, eight of the best athletes made it to the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
&quot;I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup,&quot; French newspaper Le Monde quoted Gulen as saying.
Also, the Turkish oppositionist said that &quot;if at least some of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey.&quot;
However, Gulen in every possible way denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
An Istanbul court previously arrested in absentia the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Recall that an attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead to Reimburse Lawyer Costs in Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of attorney fees it incurred in connection with a Hepatitis C drug patent litigation with drug manufacturer Merck &amp; Co Inc, a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from paying $ 200 million in damages for infringement of two Merck patents related to Gilead&#39;s drugs, top-selling drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a US judge found a number of violations by Merck, including, sworn lies and other unethical acts.
In an appeal to court on Thursday, US District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to reimbursement of costs incurred in challenging the claim.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck took legal action against each other, claiming their rights to the laboratory work behind sophosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead&#39;s medicines.
US-backed military claims to have taken full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
US-backed forces have seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last Islamic State militants left in the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now conducting a sweep of the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF-allied military council of Manbij told Reuters.
&quot;The city is now completely under our control, but we are undertaking sweeping operations,&quot; he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $ 10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $ 10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $ 1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $ 5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former Secretary of State announced $ 3 million in revenue from the publisher. Simon &amp; Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, US Senator Tim Kane from Virginia, together with his wife, Anna Holton, has released tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
&quot;Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency,&quot; Clinton campaign advisor Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast to them, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and breaking his past promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not legally required to do so.
New York-based businessman Trump and his lawyers cited an IRS audit as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
&quot;Your move,&quot; Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the declarations of the Democratic candidate.
On Thursday, Trump&#39;s special adviser Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the checks are over.
Trump&#39;s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his refusal raises questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton jumped at the issue and released an online video on Friday, highlighting prominent Republicans urging Trump to release tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on economics in Michigan.
&quot;He refuses to do what every single presidential candidate has done for decades: publish his tax returns,&quot; she told the crowd.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes in two years in the 1990s, and a business columnist for the New York Times on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as believing that this may be the case before so far.
Federal tax rates have been the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton backed a rule, named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, that would ensure that people earning more than $ 1 million a year would pay at least a 30 percent tax rate.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, suggested Trump meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he, too, is under IRS scrutiny and that Trump is not &quot;afraid&quot; of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
Clinton&#39;s campaign headquarters released tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clintons Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $ 100 of their income came from salaries.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported $ 109,000 in dividends and capital gains.

Chili Powder Condoms and Fireworks Increase Protection for Tanzanian Elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from wandering into communities by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the US Conservation Committee, took it upon themselves to promote it, training volunteers in northern Tanzania villages to use a non-violent four-step way to protect their homes. and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many used spears to defend themselves.
On Friday, there will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
&quot;Since we invented the toolbox ... we have seen a shift in attitudes within these communities, with the result that they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants,&quot; said in a statement. Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell.
The first two steps are to light a torch in front of the trespassing elephant and signal with a horn.
If it was not possible to scare him away, then they throw the so-called &quot;chili cloud&quot;.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a cracker in a condom, and its end is twisted, only the wick remains outside.
When ignited, the condom explodes with a crash, spraying fine chili powder into the air.
One breath is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a launcher that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats, who left the country after the attempted coup in July this year, have not yet returned to Turkey.
Such data were provided by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in an interview with local journalists.
At the first stage, we recalled 208 career diplomats to continue their work in the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations, &quot;the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
Let us remind you that an attempted coup d&#39;etat took place in Turkey in July.
The country&#39;s authorities officially announced that the coup had failed, and also reported the detention of over six thousand people, among them senior and middle-level military officials.
As a result of the coup attempt, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 290 people died.
Jewish director sharply criticized a Berlin hotel for removing Israel&#39;s dialing code at the &quot;request&quot; of the Arabs, RT News reported.
A Jewish French filmmaker unleashed a media scandal when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have an Israel dialing code listed, with employees citing &quot;requests&quot; from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Hotel Bristol in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to locate Israel on the dialing code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Posted by Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol offers the option to dial Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, &quot;shocked him.&quot;
The hotel clerk said the move was &quot;a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain.&quot;
The reason behind this move made the director even more angry.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the Israel code be removed,” said Lanzman, a hotel clerk.
Israel&#39;s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case &quot;a terrible shame,&quot; according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
This is, in fact, a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain is an even greater shame.
No explanation is needed here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, &quot;the official said.
The case caused a lot of resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that the Kempinski was simply &quot;following&quot; the alleged demands of Arab clients.
&quot;We would be ashamed,&quot; another post said, which indicated that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm street, was next to a synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to dismiss any accusations, calling the incident an &quot;oversight&quot; and &quot;apologizing&quot; to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
&quot;There was no direct order not to include Israel in the speed dial list,&quot; the Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski spokesman as saying.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian student protestors
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms to the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, causing the police to use rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
In line with proposals from Sao Paulo State Governor Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed and 300,000 students redeployed to save money.
Some protesters could be seen painting graffiti on walls against interim President Michael Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country&#39;s Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - reports RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent over the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing ties with Iran, and new firms are poised to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, &quot;Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $ 158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, &quot;the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mainly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year&#39;s record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken, &quot;he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
&quot;I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,&quot; he said.
The state continues to tighten the screws in the military-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the &quot;systematic failure to fulfill&quot; the instructions of the general director of the concern &quot;Almaz - Antey&quot;, &quot;omissions in work&quot; and &quot;loss of trust.&quot;
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed the head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide response in the media.
How can this silence be explained in the context of a large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the military-industrial complex (MIC) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased public attention to them.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of putting things in order in the industry.
NPO Almaz is the parent enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of sea and land-based anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM).
Almaz is currently working on the creation of the Polyment-Redut and Morpheus air defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov was caused by the failure to meet the deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of &quot;Morpheus&quot; began in 2007, and the commissioning was supposed to be in 2013.
Polyment-Redut is to become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information that I receive, in several years of testing, not a single truly successful test has been made.
True, as far as I can tell, this is not the unambiguous fault of Almaz, - said Kornev.
The expert fears that a delay in commissioning may occur with the S-500 air defense system.
Development work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should go to the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that &quot;the work is being carried out as planned and everything will be completed on time,&quot; although in 2014 the department admitted that there were problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has led Almaz since 2011.
Kornev stated that missed deadlines for projects can be both a pretext and a reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about the internal processes in the defense industry and the plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and a lot of money is known to love silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies leave their posts of their own free will, by agreement of the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place publicly, although it did not receive a response.
This suggests that the head of &quot;Almaz&quot; was, perhaps, an obstinate figure and resisted the &quot;orders&quot; coming down from above.
Apparently, the state no longer intends to put up with such behavior.
Through the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the instructions of the Ministry of Defense and do not fulfill the assigned tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the stealing managers (machinations at the Zvezda shipyard).
The President personally pays increased attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds rearmament meetings.
The Kremlin is protecting the ranks of the defense industry’s managers, seeking to have a loyal staff of directors at hand to carry out orders from above.
This is a far from ideal policy, however, against the background of rampant corruption and the absence of normal competition in the defense industry, the state has no other instruments.
The current situation in the defense industry is, of course, not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the &quot;mopping-up&quot; of managers in the defense industry complex, the Russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the arrival of Sergei Shoigu as Minister of Defense.
One gets the impression that the president has adopted the well-known saying &quot;If you want peace, prepare for war.&quot;
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which secured Moscow&#39;s spheres of influence on the continent.
For all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
The proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the &quot;winners&quot; in the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the &quot;civilized world&quot;, perhaps, there is not a single quiet corner left.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk with Russia on the level of an equal partner.
In such conditions, the only allies of our country are the navy and the army.
Strengthening military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend its national interests and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scotsman Callum Skinner races down the finish line as the British seize cycling gold
Scotsman Callum Skinner raced to triumph in the men&#39;s team sprint at the Rio velodrome last night, with the UK team trio defending their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native took on the role of the strongest, which his Scottish buddy Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly made history, racing down the finish line to snatch victory from the favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the surprise victory four years ago, winning when Hoy claimed the rights to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they did the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March Track Cycling World Championships in London, despite Hoi&#39;s retirement from that point on.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of member specialist Jamie Staff.
They did this just at the time that Hindes appeared.
Hoy&#39;s departure also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man the British coaches stuck to, seeing the potential in the Scotsman now being realized.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoi four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as a guest expert on the BBC and caught Skinner, Kenny and Hindes&#39; eyes as they stepped onto the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow said, &quot;It&#39;s a flattering comparison.&quot;
I&#39;m here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After triumphing in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted deliberately fell to the track after a bad start.
He later retracted the comment and there was no way to appeal from UK competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, &quot;I felt like I was in London with all those UK flags on the podium.&quot;
We&#39;ve all met as a team in the last three months.
We&#39;ve lost so many world-renowned races that winning the Olympics again was amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven out of 10 race titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the past five months, then five more successful days are waiting for the velodrome.
With the form shown by Kenny, it is not beyond the ability to imagine him repeating Hoy&#39;s feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same Games.
This would allow us to see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (this seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - finishing his score up to six gold medals and one silver one.
It would be just like Hoy&#39;s.
The next time Kenny competes in the sprint, which starts today and is played out over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I&#39;m just enjoying it now.
Team competition is always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It&#39;s a bit lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said: &quot;If he wins two more gold medals, he should get knighthood.&quot;
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was good news for Britain to follow.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified for the fastest four-kilometer team pursuit race in four.
They finished in 3: 51.943.
The world record set for winning gold in London 2012 is 3: 51.659.
The first round and the final (10:42 pm) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In their respective women&#39;s event, which resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Eleanor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavi improved the world record with a time of 4: 13.260.
Team UK has come to rely on a mighty team of cyclists to take ownership of the mid-period of the Olympics and earn tons of medals.
After truly exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have eased in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not the least of which were the departure from CTO Shane Sutton in April over accusations of sexism and oppression, and the departure of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the first night&#39;s race at the velodrome, it seems that Britain&#39;s now legendary glory of reaching the top at the right time may just happen again.
Portland Steel Works&#39; Future Threatened by Termination of Electricity Contract
The future of the Portland aluminum smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in jeopardy as the power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant&#39;s owners, is about to terminate the supply agreement: all supply agreements are planned to be canceled.
The move follows a decision taken earlier this year by the Victoria government not to renew the subsidies provided to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa&#39;s Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs - directly and indirectly - could be at risk from any closure.
There could also be additional indirect consequences, as the steel plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity generated in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, leading to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa&#39;s Portland Steel Works is losing money and risking shutdown.
These actions were the result of thinking about the future of the plant, which has been going on for several years, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later due to the price of the plant&#39;s products.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum smelter from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to take steps to end the contracts as well.
The plant is controlled by a short-term joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while China&#39;s CITIC and Japan&#39;s Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
&quot;AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning that physical demand for electricity from the smelter will not stop,&quot; she said.
According to AGL, the contracts referred to are so-called &#39;hedged contracts&#39;, which were due to take effect in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12 month termination period, so they will effectively end in 2017.
&quot;Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to generate their share of revenue in fiscal 2017,&quot; the utility said.
Any potential impact on AGL&#39;s earnings from FY 2018 is currently limited by forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it has already reduced the amount of contracts in its financial statements by $ 187 million in view of &quot;pending termination.&quot;
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts &quot;does not affect Alcoa&#39;s ability to operate the smelter or supply electricity to the smelter.&quot;
The American company said it entered into a twenty-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect in November this year, but it has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Turning to analysts earlier this week, AGL&#39;s chief of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of power annually, while Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants are removed from the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
It will be bad for us as a manufacturer, &quot;he said.
Not just the Kardashian reality star, Kendall on the cover of Vogue&#39;s September issue
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan of manager mother Kris, has appeared on the coveted September cover of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of Estee Lauder and has paraded at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, broke the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
&quot;Being in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried,&quot; - wrote Kendall.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the &quot;Kardashian Family&quot;?), Prepared by reality video, in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (brawlers Rob and Caitlin, who also joined them everyone&#39;s favorite uncle of show business, producer of &quot;Families Kardashian &quot;Ryan Seacrest), forgot about the appearance of her sister on the cover, and at the end - a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
This is the standard storyline of almost every episode of children&#39;s television birthday shows (Seacrest utters the line, “Did you think we forgot about you?” With the sincerity of a cartoon bunny from the 8am program), but Chris needed that fame like that. or otherwise got to other girls.
Because with this September Vogue episode, we have undoubtedly entered a new era for the Kardashian show.
Big sister Kendall Kim may have been on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September magazine cover is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue&#39;s best-selling issue of the year.
Thick, more like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the calculations of the portal Fashionista, 615 pages from last year&#39;s 832-page issue contained advertising).
News of which star will make its cover is so eagerly anticipated that over the past two years, the magazine&#39;s photos have been merged before the official announcement.
Previous women to hit the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more &quot;celebrity models&quot; than &quot;celebrity models&quot;.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, who the magazine has described as the &quot;outstanding model&quot; of her generation, falls into the first category, she&#39;s in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality TV stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner falls into all of these categories).
These are truly talented women who are doing well in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year&#39;s cover, this was one of the best years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner&#39;s success.
Jenner&#39;s position in the fashion world, given her past reality television star, has always had to remain precarious.
In June, early Victoria&#39;s Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid as &quot;bitches of the moment.&quot;
That sentiment boiled over again after news of Jenner&#39;s appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But it makes no sense to dwell on discontent.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of Vogue September.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She defiles for Marc Jacobs.
She sells you Estee Lauder foundation.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available for a paid subscription.
She sells her own photographs of Cindy Crawford&#39;s daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she does a reality show on television.
Community legal centers refuse service to 160,000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the least protected members of the public are denied access to community legal centers as the sector prepares for the effect that further funding cuts will have on already fraught activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to deal with unfair dispossession, and so on - have already been turned down trying to get free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already out of reach are preparing for further layoffs.
From June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
Queensland Community Law Centers Director James Farrell said that according to the latest census from the National Association of Community Law Centers, thousands of people are being turned down a year.
Farrell said that if the federal government&#39;s decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland&#39;s community law centers are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being denied vital services they need,” he said.
People leaving abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and ruinous debts, families going through divorce, unfairly laid off workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means thousands of less protected Queenslanders will be forced to deal with difficult legal issues without help.
We urge Attorney General and Queensland Senator George Brandis to rescind these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government honored its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of community law centers and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palashchuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump&#39;s campaign headquarters are sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a pistol
Donald Trump’s campaign headquarters were reportedly being sued for allegedly doing nothing after reporting that his North Carolina COO had threatened an employee with a pistol while driving a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state’s campaign headquarters.
Bordini said he waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that &quot;this will not happen.&quot;
Director Earl Phillip &quot;pulled out the pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the muzzle at Vincent&#39;s kneecap,&quot; Bordini states in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people were involved in similar incidents with Phillip, according to the appeal.
“Pistols don&#39;t have to fire to cause damage,” Bordini said in a complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after the Republican presidential candidate made a splash by telling listeners in North Carolina that the &quot;Second Amendment people&quot; - understood as gun owners and gun lovers - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton will be elected and will be able to select judges.
Trump&#39;s campaign team said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of the violence.
In his complaint, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip for threats of physical violence, assault and moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is hesitant to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg (Charlotte) High Court Division.
Britain must channel Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only to our local communities and London as a whole, but throughout the country.
For me, this was exactly that huge advantage of Heathrow, just like it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of immense benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local residents and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too ambitious.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would find ourselves in a quandary on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always hurdles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just a narrow circle.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £ 211 billion in economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the United Kingdom.
We have a great team at Heathrow that implemented the £ 11bn infrastructure investment program on time and on budget, from T5, which was chosen as the best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of two of the world&#39;s busiest runways.
They are now ready to secure a third runway, backed by £ 16 billion in private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics have been a huge success for the UK and I am confident there will be an expansion for Heathrow as well.
It is time for us to put the Olympic spirit back on track and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton - Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Trade Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing cat and mouse on ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad blocking software is a cat and mouse game, according to one of the companies that makes the software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post that users can update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again. ...
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of a page are ads.
But Adblock now claims to be able to bypass the new code.
In his blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that &quot;this kind of battle between the open source ad blocker community and those trying to bypass it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking,&quot; and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution. in the near future.
The fact that the world&#39;s largest social network has entered the fray is a clear sign of just how big a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to last year&#39;s study by Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times the number of those using such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users who visit Facebook through mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook&#39;s ad revenue.
However, the company is on the hunt for desktop ad blockers as mobile ad blockers are ineffective on Facebook&#39;s social media and Instagram mobile apps, according to a spokesperson.
Still, desktop advertising is a lucrative enough line item for Facebook to see it as a good investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it is going to update its &quot;advertising preferences&quot; tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
Facebook said Thursday that the new Adblock filters are worrisome as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
&quot;It will not be a positive experience for people and we plan to address this issue,&quot; a Facebook spokesman said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a crude tool, so we instead focused on building tools like Advertising Preferences to put control in the hands of people.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on the freeway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay down on the road in the dark &quot;in a gesture of despair&quot; and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
In an apparent attempt to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the drivers involved have already been questioned, but some have not yet been identified, police said, who are urging them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was opened, a &quot;logical&quot; step in this situation, lawyer Gillet Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the blow?
This is what the prosecutor must determine, &quot;Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both of which involve a person walking in the dark on a freeway - it was sentenced that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on the freeway by chance in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
An officer was acquitted last year of negligent death after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payern on the night of August 2014.
22-year-old victim drank and passed out on the road, heard the trial.
The court found that the female police officer - who answered the emergency call - was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified, and that having a person on the road was &quot;a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,&quot; the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday&#39;s incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA&#39;s climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to estimates from NASA&#39;s new climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Space Research Institute of NASA have developed a model to explore Venus&#39;s past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was developed to determine if Venus, with its hot, anhydrous surface and an oversaturated carbon dioxide atmosphere, could ever have had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus&#39;s low rotational speed is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Venus could probably have a thin Earth-like atmosphere and still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet likely had more arid regions than Earth, but it once had enough water and enough geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
&quot;According to the GISS model, Venus&#39;s slow rotation exposes its daytime side to the sun for almost two months at a time,&quot; GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the planet&#39;s surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer that acts as an umbrella protecting the planet&#39;s surface from a significant portion of the sun&#39;s heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures that, surprisingly, are several degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that experts in planetary studies previously assumed.
Even though Venus may once have been inhabited, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for billions of years.
Its oceans have evaporated and its water vapor has been burned out by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen evaporated, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model for Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy steps down as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy stepped down as coach and vice president of hockey for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team&#39;s decision-making process.
Colorado team executive vice president / general manager Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
“For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Over the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey must ideally align with the vision of the organization.
He should also have a say in decisions that affect the work of the team.
These conditions have not been met at the moment.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
&quot;Patrick informed me of his decision today,&quot; Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and we wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach of the League during his first season with Team Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was beaten by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost in the playoffs for the past two years.
Team Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 score for the 2015-2016 season and were five points behind Wild in their fight for their second Western Conference ticket.
A Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy has won four Stanley Cups - two each with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Workers &#39;strikes on oil workers&#39; wages in the North Sea have been put on hold and all parties to the discussion are embarking on a new round of negotiations, leading officials from the parties said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
&quot;Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to reopen the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes,&quot; the joint statement said.
We&#39;ll be hosting several full-day meetings over the next several weeks, starting early next week, to get a fresh perspective on issues.
Unions said their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, has targeted potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut the rates paid to contract employees working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The cut in rates from the company came after a 10 percent cut in rates for contract employees working onshore in 2014.
The additional cuts will give it the space it needs to weather the market downturn, the company said.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to end oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations with its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices: the economic situation has worsened due to the decision to leave the European Union, taken in June by the UK.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labor conflicts in the North Sea of our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just a few,” he said in a statement.
Less than $ 1.4 billion in new project spending in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The last mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the speeds of rotation of the stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data is helping astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how periods of rotation relate to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between a star&#39;s mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Louise Riball, Research Fellow at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades Cluster is 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They&#39;re spinning as fast as they never will.
At their peak rotational speeds, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a braking effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The most recent catalog of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: the larger ones pirouette more slowly than the smaller ones.
&quot;In the &#39;ballet&#39; of the Pleiades, we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster tend to be very light stars,&quot; Riball said.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with rotation rates.
&quot;The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older,&quot; said Riball.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where and why the stars slow down their speed of rotation and hang their &quot;dancing shoes&quot; on a nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades&#39; rotation rates in three new articles, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation into the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea is being conducted by two departments, Kommersant writes.
The FSB is collecting evidence of the involvement of the detainees in the preparation of sabotage in Crimea.
As previously reported, Yevgeny Panov, a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, gave a confession and agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armyansk, the oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airfields as objects for sabotage.
Law enforcers believe that not all of the saboteurs&#39; accomplices were able to detain.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev District Court of Simferopol, the newspaper notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov became the head coach of the Russian national football team
At a meeting of the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the RFU executive committee appointed Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a famous footballer who previously played in the Moscow &quot;Spartak&quot; as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as the same &quot;Spartak&quot;, &quot;Zhemchuzhina-Sochi&quot;, &quot;Terek&quot;, &quot;Amkar&quot;, “Dynamo”, as well as the Warsaw “Legia”, which became the winner of the national championship and the cup of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the very near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is he who has the responsibility to prepare the national team for the 2018 world championship.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romaschenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information according to which the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the leadership of the RFU set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to bring the Russian national team to the semifinals and win medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team as a priority task and is going to give the players the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov, the Russian national team will play on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly match with the Turkish team.
We will remind, earlier the post of the head coach of the Russian national football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the disastrous performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the national team on himself.
Squeezed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia has suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, this country of 2.4 million has made tremendous strides, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia&#39;s success is that the government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take free primary and secondary education for granted, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce &quot;cost recovery&quot; tuition fees.
However, in Namibia, primary schooling is free.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The country&#39;s authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of the disease by 97% over the past ten years.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, a standard measure of inequality in the distribution of income, has dropped 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate fell from 69% in 1993 to less than 30%.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (on less than $ 1.90 a day) also fell, from nearly 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is well ahead of the United States and other wealthy nations.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - on Transparency International&#39;s Corruption Perceptions Index.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia manages to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the ratio of debt to GDP is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional methods of assessment, is still quite high - almost 28%.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV / AIDS - almost 17% of the population is infected.
The World Bank ranks Namibia as an upper middle-income country, but the authorities insist that their country is in fact a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the challenges that are inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
Isolated nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes live in the country&#39;s deserts, which in one way or another must be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: just like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, the country is solving the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities set about creating a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
Significantly, competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only for its own citizens, but also for its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical institutions in the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbors, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, take part in regional medical projects, encourage investment and student exchange.
Moreover, the Namibian government has rightly judged that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that the revenues from Namibia&#39;s natural wealth need to be invested in infrastructure and manufacturing facilities.
They also recognize that it would be irresponsible not to seek the maximum profit from the sale of a country&#39;s resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency is critical to this process, which is why strong government support for free speech is so important.
As the head of state Hage Geingob noted, the media often say what he does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it won, the president said.
Not all of Namibia&#39;s key resources are exhaustible.
Some - such as fishing - are renewable, and the government is working hard to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country every year.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start out with serious flaws - racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment - can be on the path to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the &quot;Gold of Varna&quot; - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps this was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic amount of gold artifacts was found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
From only one burial site, known as &quot;Grave No. 43&quot;, 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were recovered.
However, the official status of the oldest gold in the world may soon pass to a nondescript-looking bead found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsite.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Yunatsite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunatsite, Pazardzhik region.
The bead is a gold strip rolled into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, head of the Tell Yunatsite excavation, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it was at least 200 years older than the gold of Varna.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date back to approximately the same period, 4600 - 4200 years. BC.
There is currently no technology to date metal with impeccable accuracy.
Where is the confidence in which gold is more ancient?
Apparently Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: &quot;I am quite sure that Yunatsite&#39;s gold is older than Varna&#39;s gold.&quot;
This is a find of extreme importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it is large enough to take its rightful place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, and also re-and more thoroughly study the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yunatsite is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Nowadays Tell Yunatsite is considered the oldest &quot;city&quot; in Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the next centuries, metal processing developed rapidly in this region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In Russian historiography, this archaeological community has a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban-type settlements began to appear around the centers of metalworking.
Now they are called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunatsite is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts from 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yunatsite the prototype of the modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even in comparison with Mesopotamia.
&quot;This place is a thousand years older than Sumer,&quot; says Boyadzhiev, referring to the conventional wisdom that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia - modern Iraq.
The first cities in the usual sense of the word arose there.
Tell Yunatsite has been excavating since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of a fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
Little has survived from houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, dense urban development, a &quot;business center&quot; and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the &quot;Bird City&quot;: dozens of clay figurines of birds have been found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the assumption arose that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local cult.
The &quot;Bird City&quot; was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes who came from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-meter fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have uncovered obvious signs of a brutal massacre: the remains of old people, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes were found inside the houses.
New finds and new facts appear every year, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the &quot;lost&quot; first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive in the search for this civilization was the &quot;gold of Varna&quot; found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that the golden luxury of Varna should have been preceded by something - something like a tiny gold bead created in Tell Yunatsite.
Porsche artificially aged 911 Targa
It is officially announced that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by the specialists of the division who work with production cars.
The &quot;retro look&quot; is, for example, in the special body color Etna Blue, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B - even the model&#39;s logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa received signature white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder rims, as well as some exterior details painted in &quot;white and gold metallic&quot;.
There are noticeably fewer retro features in the interior: it differs, by and large, in a gray-blue gamut of design, new armchairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and thresholds trimmed with black anodized steel with the division&#39;s logo.
In addition, when purchasing the special version, each customer will receive a car cover and a richly decorated album with photographs of the production process as a gift.
The Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch the power plant: the retro-targa has the same characteristics as the serial one.
It is equipped with a 3.0-liter turbocharged six-cylinder engine developing 420 hp. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km / h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each specific sports car has been disclosed.
Facebook and ad blockers unleash an arms race
Facebook&#39;s recent introduction of technology to prevent ad-hiding on social media pages prompted developers of ad blocking solutions to retaliate.
AdBlock Plus has released an &quot;antidote&quot;, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
This is how AdBlock Plus advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Representatives of the social network noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of &quot;non-blocking&quot; advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus, along with commercial ads, also blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook has deplored this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to resolve the issue soon.
As a source among the developers of the social network told TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop Facebook site will be ready within the next hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of &quot;arms race&quot;, trying to beat each other, while the victims were users who missed interesting posts from friends or saw ads where they were not used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been hotly debated lately.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear before the court · Vecherny Murmansk.

The investigation established that at the end of November 2015 the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed acts of a sexual nature with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl. The criminal case with an approved indictment was sent for consideration on the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for the maximum punishment in the form of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring a Fengguang 370 cross van and a Rich New pickup to Russia - Behind the wheel website www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of a class of cars that is gaining popularity in China, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms have decided to ignore the Moscow International Auto Show this year, so Chinese firms will fill the void of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls.
In particular, Dongfeng Motor Corporation will act as a powerful front, which has great views on the Russian market and intends to offer our motorists a number of interesting new products in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 cross-van, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (a little less than 550 thousand rubles at the current exchange rate).
Such a price tag is unlikely to shine for the Russians, and the question of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, according to the results of June sales, the Fengguang 370 managed to reach 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivans, although due to the high ground clearance (175 mm) and a protective plastic body kit along the lower perimeter of the body, it can be considered a crossover.
The crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger Fengguang 360 model, the 370 has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden slats, but shown in the photo is a large vertical touch screen &quot;like Tesla&quot; on the center console was only on the early exhibition copies of the Crossvan, and cars with simpler &quot;music&quot; went on sale.
Five of the seven seats can be easily folded to form a flat loading area 1650 mm long, with a maximum boot capacity of 1500 liters.
There is only one engine for the Fengguang 370 - a 1.5-liter petrol &quot;aspirated&quot; 115 hp, docked with a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the car, but it promises a sparing budget for the owner&#39;s appetite at the level of 6.7 l / 100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a familiar Nissan NP300 Navara of the last generation to Russians, but with a slightly refined design by Chinese stylists.
Despite the morally outdated design, this model is still in steady demand among the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious &quot;workhorse&quot;.
At a reasonable price, the Rich New will certainly be of interest to Russians as well, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: a gasoline 2.4 l (137 hp) or a turbo diesel 2.5 l (116 hp).
The gearbox is only mechanics, the drive is to the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly connected &quot;front end&quot;.
The new flagship sedan A9 will also be at the Dongfeng stand, its Russian premiere was announced by the representative office of the Chinese company back in June.
There are more and more minivan-like crossovers in the Chinese market, one of the latest novelties is Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian line of Dongfeng consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
For seven months of this year, dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notifications will no longer be sent by mail - Behind the wheel website www.zr.ru
The tax office has changed the procedure for sending notifications about property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to a scheme that has not changed over the years: in the summer and autumn, they receive receipts by mail for payment of the transport tax for the previous year.
However, many will not wait for them this year.
The fact is that the tax office quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who are registered in the &quot;Personal account of the taxpayer&quot; on the official website of the department nalog.ru will receive notifications in electronic form.
The inspectorate automatically considered such Russians to be online users and deleted them from the standard, &quot;paper&quot; mailing list.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will continue to receive their usual letters.
However, owners of an account on the site also have the opportunity to return to the old scheme.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notification will appear in the &quot;personal account&quot; immediately after compilation, while the letter will take several days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate has exceeded 18 million, which will allow the department to seriously save on mailing.
On the other hand, modest news on the site of the inspection is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in a &quot;personal account&quot; to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of non-payers with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the &quot;Personal account of the taxpayer&quot; is carried out in three ways: through the account of the gosuslugi.ru portal, using an electronic signature or entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any tax office (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid by December 1.
Distribution of notifications began in July.
Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which modifications are aimed at achieving very high returns, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not bother the masters of the G-Power company, who took up the modification of the sport version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its craftsmen.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - a 571-horsepower flying sledgehammer with tank aerodynamics and acceleration to 100 km / h in 5.4 seconds?
Pumping up the &quot;muscles&quot; of the crazy &quot;Gelik&quot;, the craftsmen took advantage of the 5.5-liter supercharged &quot;eight&quot;.
But the dynamics of acceleration to hundreds has improved by indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying &quot;brick&quot; is capable of a jerk in 5.3 s.
However, acceleration from medium speeds is probably much better for him.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not travel faster than 210 km / h, then a tuning SUV with a deactivated electronic &quot;collar&quot; is able to squeeze 250 km / h.
From the outside, the car is practically indistinguishable from its original factory source, with the exception of the other rims - the 23-inch Hurricane RR in the dimension 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced a striking 6m concept coupe to be presented at the Pebble Beach Elegance Competition.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the green sub-brand BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand name.
In the coming years, at least four eco-friendly innovations are expected to appear.
